"Inhibition of cancer growth by resveratrol is related to its low bioavailability The relationship between resveratrol (RES) bioavalability and its effect on tumor growth was investigated. Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and oral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. Half-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., was very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in plasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in mice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the first 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, and kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g fresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least 99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol of t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver can remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by t-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was found in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M cells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral administration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking water at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of mice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased hepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The antimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).",0
"The quantitation of metabolites of quercetin flavonols in human urine The flavonoid quercetin, or its metabolites, inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in rodents and may have a role in the prevention of human cancers. Quercetin exposure in human populations results from the dietary intake of various plant foods; high concentrations of quercetin are found in apples, onions, tea, and red wine. Determination of the relationship between dietary intake and cancer risk depends on the characterization of quercetin intake. The development and use of biomarkers for quercetin intake may provide a basis for the objective classification of this exposure. One possible biomarker is metabolic products of quercetin. We report the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assay for quantitation of quercetin metabolites in human urine. The metabolites include 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (homoprotocatechuic acid), metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (homovanillic acid). The assay has only two major steps, ether extraction and HPLC analysis, and is suitable for analysis of large sample numbers. Analytical characteristics of the assay include a sensitivity of less than 1 microgram, precision with coefficients of variation < 10%, and metabolite recoveries > 90%. The mean concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in two human urine samples are approximately 0.7, 4.8, and 2.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The identification of each metabolite is confirmed by HPLC, UV absorbance scans, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. These results verify the occurrence of quercetin metabolites in human urine and the feasibility of quercetin metabolite quantitation, by the assay described herein, for epidemiological studies. Development of the analytical procedure is an essential first step for validation of the metabolites as biomarkers of quercetin intake.",1
"Anthocyanins exist in the circulation primarily as metabolites in adult men Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 (nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 (nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.",1
"Influence of organic versus conventional agricultural practice on the antioxidant microconstituent content of tomatoes and derived purees  consequences on antioxidant plasma status in humans The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.",1
"Sensitive determination of phenolic acids in extra-virgin olive oil by capillary zone electrophoresis A sensitive, rapid, efficient, and reliable method for the separation and determination of phenolic acids by capillary zone electrophoresis has been carried out. A detailed method optimization was carried out to separate 14 different compounds by studying parameters such as pH, type and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and injection time. The separation was performed within 16 min, using a 25 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6) at 25 kV with 8 s of hydrodynamic injection. With this method and using a liquid-liquid extraction system, with recovery values around 95%, it has been possible to detect small quantities of phenolic acids in olive oil samples. This is apparently the first paper showing the quantification of this specific family of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil samples.",1

"Detection of phloridzin in strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) by HPLC-PDA-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC analysis of the corresponding acyclic 1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.",1
"A highly sensitive and robust UPLC-MS with electrospray ionization method for quantitation of taxifolin in rat plasma A sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the quantification of taxifolin in rat plasma. Following liquid/liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, the analytes were separated on a Sunfire (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 3.5 microm) column and analyzed in the selected ion recording with a negative electrospray ionization mode. The method was linear over the concentration range of 6-6750 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precisions were all within 8% and accuracy ranged from 92.9% to 105.1%. The lower limit of quantification was 6 ng/mL. The present method was successfully applied to the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration to rats. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin was 0.17% in rat.",1
"Intestinal absorption of luteolin and luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats and humans In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of luteolin and luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat everted small intestine demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to luteolin. Free luteolin, its conjugates and methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. This suggests that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and the hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main conjugate which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the unchanged aglycone. Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed more rapidly than that in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma concentration of luteolin and its conjugates reached the highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin in propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the presence of free luteolin and its monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion of luteolin.",1
"Contents of phenolic acids, alkyl- and alkenylresorcinols, and avenanthramides in commercial grain products The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat (Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg (whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes (26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols (524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).",1
"Bioavailability and tissue distribution of anthocyanins in bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract in rats To clarify how structural diversity of anthocyanins relates to their in vivo function, bioavailability was precisely studied in rats using bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract (Bilberon 25) as an anthocyanin source that contains 15 different anthocyanins. The bilberry extract was orally or intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside were detectable in the blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the maximum level of 1.2 microM at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg bilberry extract (153.2 mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous administration were only 30.8 and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma. The major anthocyanins distributed in liver and kidney were the O-methyl anthocyanins such as peonidin, malvidin, and other O-methyl anthocyanins derived from delphinidin, cyanidin, and petunidin-glycosides.",1
"Cocoa powder enhances the level of antioxidative activity in rat plasma The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin (EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the antioxidative activity of plasma.",0
"Anthocyanins, phenolics, and antioxidant capacity in diverse small fruits: vaccinium, rubus, and ribes Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.",0

"Identification of metabolites in human plasma and urine after consumption of a polyphenol-rich juice drink A polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was developed as a potential approach to increase intake of dietary polyphenols. Analysis of the beverage by HPLC with PDA, fluorescence, and MS detection facilitated the identification/partial identification of 40 flavonoids and related phenolic compounds. The main constituents were (-)-epigallocatechin and other green tea flavan-3-ols, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside, gallic acid, hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and procyanidins, with trace levels of several flavonols and purple grape juice anthocyanins also being present. Healthy human subjects (n = 10) consumed 350 mL of the P-R juice drink, after which plasma and urine samples were collected over a 0-24 h period. HPLC-MS analysis identified 13 metabolites in plasma and a further 20 in urine. Qualitatively, the profiles of the glucuronide, sulfated, and methylated metabolites were very similar to those detected in earlier investigations when the main components in the juice drink were consumed separately in feeding studies with coffee, green tea, orange juice, and apple cider.",1
"Presence of virgin olive oil phenolic metabolites in human low density lipoprotein fraction: determination by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry The biological benefits of olive oil in preventing the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) would seem to be linked to its high monounsaturated fatty acid contents, but also to its respective phenolic compounds contents. One prerequisite to assess the in vivo physiological significance of phenolic compounds is to determine their presence in human LDL following the ingestion of virgin olive oil. In this work, olive oil phenolic metabolites were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) detection, after solid phase extraction (SPE). Quantitative methods were developed in carrying out linearity, precision, sensitivity and recovery tests. The results from two methods of LDL separation were compared and shorter LDL isolation procedure showed a better recovery for antioxidants compounds in LDL. The metabolites identified in LDL were: hydroxytyrosol monoglucuronide, hydroxytyrosol monosulfate, tyrosol glucuronide, tyrosol sulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate. The fact that olive oil phenolic metabolites are able to bind LDL strengthens claims that these compounds act as in vivo antioxidants.",0
"GC-MS methods for metabolic profiling of microbial fermentation products of dietary polyphenols in human and in vitro intervention studies Flavonoids, a subclass of polyphenols, are major constituents of many plant-based foods and beverages, including tea, wine and chocolate. Epidemiological studies have shown that a flavonoid-rich diet is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the flavonoids survive intact until they reach the colon where they are then extensively metabolized into smaller fragments. Here, we describe the development of GC-MS-based methods for the profiling of phenolic microbial fermentation products in urine, plasma, and fecal water. Furthermore, the methods are applicable for profiling products obtained from in vitro batch culture fermentation models. The methods incorporate enzymatic deconjugation, liquid-liquid extraction, derivatization, and subsequent analysis by GC-MS. At the level of individual compounds, the methods gave recoveries better than 80% with inter-day precision being better than 20%, depending on the matrix. Limits of detection were below 0.1 microg/ml for most phenolic acids. The newly developed methods were successfully applied to samples from human and in-vitro intervention trials, studying the metabolic impact of flavonoid intake. In conclusion, the methods presented are robust and generally applicable to diverse biological fluids. Its profiling character is useful to investigate on a large scale the gut microbiome-mediated bioavailability of flavonoids.",0
"Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut microbial flora to synthesize equol.",1
"RP-HPLC analysis of the phenolic compounds of plant extracts. Investigation of their antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280 mg/100 g of dry sample) and caffeic acid (1.2-60 mg/100 g of dry sample). (+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against selected microbes was also conducted in this study.",0
"Soy consumption alters endogenous estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women Isoflavones are soy phytoestrogens that have been suggested to be anticarcinogenic. Our previous study in premenopausal women suggested that the mechanisms by which isoflavones exert cancer-preventive effects may involve modulation of estrogen metabolism away from production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites [16alpha-(OH) estrone, 4-(OH) estrone, and 4-(OH) estradiol] (X. Xu et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 7: 1101-1108, 1998). To further evaluate this hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone feeding study was performed in 18 healthy postmenopausal women. The study consisted of three diet periods, each separated by a washout of approximately 3 weeks. Each diet period lasted for 93 days, during which subjects consumed their habitual diets supplemented with soy protein isolate providing 0.1 (control), 1, or 2 mg isoflavones/kg body weight/day (7.1 +/- 1.1, 65 +/- 11, or 132 +/- 22 mg/day). A 72-h urine sample was collected 3 days before the study (baseline) and days 91-93 of each diet period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Compared with the soy-free baseline and very low isoflavone control diet, consumption of 65 mg isoflavones increased the urinary 2/16alpha-(OH) estrone ratio, and consumption of 65 or 132 mg isoflavones decreased excretion of 4-(OH) estrone. When compared with baseline values, consumption of all three soy diets increased the ratio of 2/4-(OH) estrogens and decreased the ratio of genotoxic: total estrogens. These data suggest that both isoflavones and other soy constituents may exert cancer-preventive effects in postmenopausal women by altering estrogen metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.",0
"Strawberry consumption is associated with increased antioxidant capacity in serum Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < .01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant capacity in a healthy population.",1
"Characterization of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil and their effect on the formation of carcinogenic/mutagenic heterocyclic amines in a model system Mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HAs) are formed at low levels during cooking of meat and fish, and some of them are considered to be possible human carcinogens. The formation of HAs may be affected by the presence of synthetic or naturally occurring antioxidants. In the present study the effect of virgin olive oil (VOO) phenolic compounds, identified and quantified by LC-MS, on the formation of HAs in a model system was evaluated. An aqueous solution of creatinine, glucose, and glycine was heated in the presence of two samples of VOO differing only in the composition of phenolic compounds. The addition of VOO to the model system inhibited the formation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) by between 30 and 50% compared with the control. Fresh-made olive oil, which contained a high amount of dihydroxyphenylethanol derivatives, inhibited HA formation more than a 1-year-old oil did. The inhibition of HA formation was also verified using phenolic compounds extracted from VOO.",1
"Development of a quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection measurement system for phenolic acids A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.",1
"Antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of some leafy vegetables Some leafy vegetables were studied for their nutritional composition, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. The aerial parts of Coriandrum sativum, Spinacia oleracea, Trigonella corniculata and Trigonella foenum-graecum showed lower inhibitory concentration values (4.1-7.9 mg/ml), efficiency concentration values (178-321 mg/mg DPPH) and higher values of anti-radical power (0.31-0.51) as compared with their seeds. Thermal treatment reduced the total phenolic contents, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. The leaves of C. sativum were found with good amounts of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and chlorogenic acid.",1
"Effects of storage conditions on furocoumarin levels in intact, chopped, or homogenized parsnips Furocoumarins represent a family of natural food constituents with phototoxic and photomutagenic properties. They are found mainly in plants belonging to the Rutaceae and Umbilliferae such as celery, carrots, and parsnips. Parsnips (Pastinaca sativa L.) have become more and more popular as a vegetable, e.g., as a constituent of or ingredient in baby food. Previous work has shown that microbial infection of parsnip roots can result in a dramatic increase in furocoumarin levels. In this study, freshly harvested parsnips were stored as whole roots, pieces (cubes), or homogenate at +4 degrees C or -18 degrees C over various time periods under standard conditions. It was found that furocoumarin concentrations (sum of five furocoumarins: angelicin, isopimpinellin, 5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and psoralen) in freshly harvested parsnips, analyzed by HPLC after extraction with diethyl ether and sequential solid phase (reversed-phase and silica) extraction, was generally lower than 2.5 mg/kg, and storage of parsnips in any form investigated at -18 degrees C over up to 50 days did not lead to a marked increase in furocoumarin levels. In contrast, storage of whole parsnips, but not of cubes or homogenate, at +4 degrees C resulted in a marked biphasic increase of furocoumarin concentrations after 7 and 38 days of storage up to levels of about 40 mg/kg. A dramatic increase in furocoumarin concentrations up to 566 mg/kg was observed when whole parsnips obtained from the market were kept at room temperature over 53 days, resulting in a visible microbial (mold) infection. Baby food products from the German market containing parsnips as an ingredient or constituent showed furocoumarin levels < or =0.41 mg/kg, suggesting that properly stored roots/preparations have been used. It is recommended that, after harvesting, parsnips be kept at -18 degrees C or under other conditions that prevent microbial infections.",1
"Microwave-assisted extraction of the main phenolic compounds in flaxseed A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time consumption.",1
"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of spinach as affected by genetics and maturation Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.",0
"Procyanidin dimer B2 [epicatechin-(4beta-8)-epicatechin] in human plasma after the consumption of a flavanol-rich cocoa Epidemiologic studies have linked flavonoid-rich foods with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality. Some cocoas are flavonoid-rich and contain the monomeric flavanols (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin and oligomeric procyanidins formed from these monomeric units. Both the monomers and the oligomers have shown potential in favorably influencing cardiovascular health in in vitro and preliminary clinical studies. Although previous investigations have shown increasing concentrations of (-)-epicatechin in human plasma after cocoa consumption, no information is available in the published literature regarding the presence of procyanidins in human plasma.",1
"Chemical composition and oxidative stability of flax, safflower and poppy seed and seed oils Three seeds of Turkish origin, flax, poppy and safflower were analyzed for their proximate, fatty acids, tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and total phenolic composition, and oxidative stability of their oil. The major fatty acid in the flax oil was alpha-linolenic acid, comprising 58.3% of total fatty acids, whereas poppy and safflower oils were rich in linoleic acid at 74.5% and 70.5% level, respectively. The amount of total tocols was 14.6 mg/100g flax, 11.0mg/100g poppy and 12.1mg/100g safflower seed. Flax and poppy oil were rich in gamma-tocopherol as 79.4 mg/100g oil and 30.9 mg/100g oil, respectively, while alpha-tocopherol (44.1g/100g oil) was dominant in safflower oil. Only alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol were found in the oils. Oxidative stability of oils was measured at 110 degrees C at the rate of 20 L/h air flow rate, and poppy oil (5.56 h) was most stabile oil followed by safflower oil (2.87 h) and flax oil (1.57). There were no correlation between oxidative stability and unsaturation degree of fatty acids and tocol levels of the oils. All of the seeds investigated provide a healthy oil profile and may have potential as a source of specialty oils on a commercial scale.",1
"Antioxidant properties of raw and processed cabbages To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant activities of cabbages, the amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity and individual phenolic compounds in raw and processed cabbages were determined. Fresh and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest total phenolic contents (393.1+/-10.8 mg and 366.3+/-3.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh sample, respectively). Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids (108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.",0

"Metabolism of phenolic compounds during loquat fruit development Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.",1

"Development of a rapid method based on solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance detection for the determination of polyphenols in alcohol-free beers An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.",0
"HPLC method for analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in flaxseeds A method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseeds. The analytical method involves extraction of defatted flaxseed flour with dioxane/ethanol, aqueous base-hydrolysis, solid-phase purification of an SDG-containing fraction, and quantitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pure SDG was isolated from flaxseed using different column chromatographic methods and used, as external standard, for the calibration of the method and for quantification. The method was then applied to study the variation in SDG content in flaxseeds from 14 cultivars grown in Sweden and 15 cultivars grown in Denmark. The SDG content varied between 11.7 and 24.1 mg/g in defatted flaxseed flour and between 6.1 and 13.3 mg/g in whole flaxseeds.",0

"Induction of antioxidant flavonol biosynthesis in fresh-cut potatoes. Effect of domestic cooking The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.",0
"Identification by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analyses and quantification of constituents of fennel teas and decoctions Qualitative and quantitative differences among the constituents in various fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., family Apiaceae) teas prepared by classical infusion, microwave decoction, and dissolution are reported. Different commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were found in two teas. Quality, activity, and safety of the content of the investigated preparations are also discussed.",1
"An LC-MS-based metabolomics approach for exploring urinary metabolome modifications after cocoa consumption Cocoa-phytochemicals have been related to the health-benefits of cocoa consumption. Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of phytochemicals and its relation with human health.",1
"Novel biomarkers of the metabolism of caffeic acid derivatives in vivo The purpose of this study was to investigate biomarkers of the bioavailability and metabolism of hydroxycinnamate derivatives through the determination of the pharmacokinetics of their urinary elimination and identification of the metabolites excreted. Coffee was used as a rich source of caffeic acid derivatives and human supplementation was undertaken. The results show a highly significant increase in the excretion of ferulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic acid (3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid), and vanillic acid postsupplementation relative to the levels presupplementation. Thus, ferulic, isoferulic, and dihydroferulic acids are specific biomarkers for the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary caffeic acid esters. Isoferulic acid is a unique biomarker as it is not a dietary component, however, dihydroferulic acid may well derive from other flavonoids with a structurally related B-ring. 3-Hydroxyhippuric acid has also been identified as an indicator for bioavailability and metabolism of phenolic compounds, and shows a highly significant excretion increase postsupplementation. The results reveal isoferulic acid (and possibly dihydroferulic acid) as novel markers of caffeoyl quinic acid metabolism.",0

"Determination of anthocyanins and related components in red wines by micro- and capillary HPLC Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and quantification of components present in a very small amounts.",0
"Formation and identification of 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin in humans The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC and for future elucidation of its biological activities.",1
"Elevated circulating LDL phenol levels in men who consumed virgin rather than refined olive oil are associated with less oxidation of plasma LDL In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null (0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = -0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.",0
"Quantitative analysis of flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables and beverages by high-performance liquid chromatography with photo-diode array and mass spectrometric detection A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.",1

"Health-promoting compounds in broccoli as influenced by refrigerated transport and retail sale period Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate (glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.",1
"Polyphenols from alcoholic apple cider are absorbed, metabolized and excreted by humans We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) (maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin = 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.",0
"Bioavailability of ellagic acid in human plasma after consumption of ellagitannins from pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) juice Ellagic acid (EA) and hydrolyzable ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols found in fruits and nuts and implicated with potent antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherosclerotic biological properties. Unfortunately, there are no reports on the bioavailability studies of EA or ETs in the human body. We conducted in vivo studies whereby a human subject consumed pomegranate juice (PJ) (180 ml) containing EA (25 mg) and ETs (318 mg, as punicalagins, the major fruit ellagitannin).",0
"Anthocyanin metabolism in rats and their distribution to digestive area, kidney, and brain Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.",1
"Determination of hydroxycinnamic acids and volatile phenols in wort and beer by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography using electrochemical detection The suitability of a simple and rapid isocratic RP-HPLC method with amperometric electrochemical detection for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hydroxycinnamic acids and their corresponding aroma-active volatile phenols in wort and beer is reported. The technique gives good specificity and sensitivity, and can therefore be used for routine monitoring of hydroxycinnamic acids in wort and the development of volatile phenolic flavour compounds during the beer production process and subsequent conservation.",1
"Polyphenolic profiles of Basque cider apple cultivars and their technological properties The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.",0
"Rapid quantification of the phenolic fraction of Spanish virgin olive oils by capillary electrophoresis with UV detection A rapid and reliable capillary zone electrophoresis method was used as a tool to obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about simple phenols, lignans, complex phenols (isomeric forms of secoiridoids), phenolic acids, and flavonoids in the solid-phase separation extracts from different Spanish extra-virgin olive oil in a short time (less than 6 min). Peak identification was done by using commercial and HPLC-isolated standards, studying the information of the electropherograms obtained at several wavelengths and also using the information previously reported. For the quantification of lignans and complex phenols (secoiridoid derivatives), we used a reference compound (oleuropein glucoside) at two different wavelengths (200 and 240 nm) and for the quantification of tyrosol and flavonoids, we used their commercially available standards.",0

"Effects of different cooking methods on nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of selected vegetables The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and physicochemical qualities.",1

"Influence of the metabolic profile on the in vivo antioxidant activity of quercetin under a low dosage oral regimen in rats Flavonoids are known to possess a broad set of pharmacological effects, some of which have been attributed to their antioxidant properties and, more recently, to cell signalling modulation. Nevertheless, flavonoids are extensively metabolized and their metabolites are the potential bioactive forms in vivo. Therefore, a first and crucial step to understand the mechanisms underlying potential health benefits of flavonoids is knowledge of their metabolites and their biological activities.",1
"Development of a sensitive and specific solid phase extraction--gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol in rat urine A novel gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was developed, using an ion trap mass spectrometer, for the simultaneous determination of olive oil bioactive components, elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol, in rat urine. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after enzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with greater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed by a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves were linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. The limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic acid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg). The method was applied to the analysis of rat urine samples after sustained oral intake of oleuropein or extra virgin olive oil as a diet supplement.",1
"RP-HPLC analysis of the phenolic compounds of plant extracts. Investigation of their antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280 mg/100 g of dry sample) and caffeic acid (1.2-60 mg/100 g of dry sample). (+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against selected microbes was also conducted in this study.",1
"Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their tannin content using the proposed method.",1

Fast analysis of soy isoflavones by high-performance liquid chromatography with monolithic columns A fast method using high-performance liquid chromatography based on two monolithic columns has been developed for the simultaneous determination of isoflavones extracted from soybeans and derived foods. The 12 main isoflavones were resolved in 10 min in two coupled monolithic columns working at 35 degrees C using a elution gradient of acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) and methanol (0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1). Retention time and relative area standard deviations were below 1% for all isoflavones. The method developed was successfully applied to several soy food samples and spiked samples. Total isoflavone concentration in sampled soy foods ranged from 34.28 mg L(-1) to 4.29 mg g(-1).,0
"Iberian pig as a model to clarify obscure points in the bioavailability and metabolism of ellagitannins in humans Ellagitannin-containing foods (strawberries, walnuts, pomegranate, raspberries, oak-aged wine, etc.) have attracted attention due to their cancer chemopreventive, cardioprotective, and antioxidant effects. Ellagitannins (ETs) are not absorbed as such but are metabolized by the intestinal flora to yield urolithins (hydroxydibenzopyran-6-one derivatives). In this study, Iberian pig is used as a model to clarify human ET metabolism. Pigs were fed either cereal fodder or acorns, a rich source of ETs. Plasma, urine, bile, lumen and intestinal tissues (jejunum and colon), feces, liver, kidney, heart, brain, lung, muscle, and subcutaneous fat tissue were analyzed. The results demonstrate that acorn ETs release ellagic acid (EA) in the jejunum, then the intestinal flora metabolizes EA sequentially to yield tetrahydroxy- (urolithin D), trihydroxy- (urolithin C), dihydroxy- (urolithin A), and monohydroxy- (urolithin B) dibenzopyran-6-one metabolites, which were absorbed preferentially when their lipophilicity increased. Thirty-one ET-derived metabolites were detected, including 25 urolithin and 6 EA derivatives. Twenty-six extensively conjugated metabolites were detected in bile, glucuronides and methyl glucuronides of EA and particularly urolithin A, C, and D derivatives, confirming a very active enterohepatic circulation. Urolithins A and B as well as dimethyl-EA-glucuronide were detected in peripheral plasma. The presence of EA metabolites in bile and in urine and its absence in intestinal tissues suggested its absorption in the stomach. Urolithin A was the only metabolite detected in feces and together with its glucuronide was the most abundant metabolite in urine. No metabolites accumulated in any organ analyzed. The whole metabolism of ETs is shown for the first time, confirming previous studies in humans and explaining the long persistency of urolithin metabolites in the body mediated by an active enterohepatic circulation.",1
"Content of free phenolic compounds in cultivars of potatoes harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands) Determination of free phenolic compounds in potato samples was optimized using a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line diode array detection. This method was applied to samples of four cultivars of potatoes harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between (+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.",1
"Polyphenols in wild and weedy Mexican common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and health.",1
"Phenol antioxidant quantity and quality in foods: beers and the effect of two types of beer on an animal model of atherosclerosis The free phenols have been measured in 15 lagers, 6 porters and ales, and 11 light and nonalcoholic beers. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using an oxidation-reduction reaction with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and catechin as the standard. The order of phenol concentration was ales > lagers > low calorie > nonalcoholic. The quality of antioxidants of the major phenols in beers and the quality of beer antioxidants were measured by (1) dose-response inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation and (2) concentration of phenols in the beers at which 50% of the peroxide was destroyed in a luminescent assay for antioxidant activity. The beers' lipoprotein antioxidant quality was clearly superior to that of vitamin antioxidants and to that of the phenol ingredients, suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. The average per capita consumption of beer in the United States in 2000 was 225 mL/day, equivalent to 42 mg/day of catechin equivalents. Beer provides more antioxidants per day than wine in the U.S. diet. A dark beer and a lager beer were given at two concentrations to cholesterol-fed hamsters, an animal model of atherosclerosis. At the high dose ((1)/(2)-diluted beer) both lager and dark beer significantly inhibited atherosclerosis compared to a control of 2% alcohol. At the high dose, lager significantly decreased cholesterol and triglycerides, and both beers acted as in vivo antioxidants by decreasing the oxidizability of lower density lipoproteins. At the low dose ((1)/(10)-diluted beer) only the lager beer significantly decreased atherosclerosis compared to the 0.4% alcohol control. The polyphenols in the beers appear to be responsible for the benefits of beer in this model. Lager beer inhibited atherosclerosis at a human equivalent dose in this hamster model of atherosclerosis.",1
"Polyphenolic profiles of Basque cider apple cultivars and their technological properties The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.",1
"Flavanone metabolism in healthy and tumor-bearing rats Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the bioavailability of flavonoids.",1
"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of spinach as affected by genetics and maturation Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.",1

"Evaluation of the phenolic content in the aerial parts of different varieties of Cichorium intybus L Fresh aerial parts of different chicory varieties: green chicory (c.v. ""Catalogna""), two red chicory varieties (""radicchio rosso di Chioggia"" and ""radicchio rosso di Treviso""), and Witloof or Belgian endive were analyzed by HPLC/DAD/MS. The chromatographic fingerprint was diagnostic for each variety. A monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid were detected in all the varieties, while cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside were the main phenolic compounds in the red varieties. The flavonoidic compounds, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, were absent in the Witloof sample. The phenolic compounds from total leaves were the same as those obtained from only the colored parts; nevertheless, the total amount was remarkably lower with a decrease of up to 80% for Belgian endive. Chemical stability at high temperature was observed for the phenolic fraction from the green variety after decoction at 100 degrees C for 30 min.",1
"Effect of cultivar and growing location on the trypsin inhibitors, tannins, and lectins of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in the semiarid highlands of Mexico Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.",1
"Sulfated ferulic acid is the main in vivo metabolite found after short-term ingestion of free ferulic acid in rats The bioavailability of ferulic acid (FA; 3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and its metabolites was investigated in rat plasma and urine after an oral short-term ingestion of 5.15 mg/kg of FA. Free FA, glucuronoconjugates, and sulfoconjugates were quickly detected in plasma with a peak of concentration found 30 min after ingestion. Sulfoconjugates were the main derivates ( approximately 50%). In urine, the cumulative excretion of total metabolites reached a plateau 1.5 h after ingestion, and approximately 40% were excreted by this way. Free FA recovered in urine represented only 4.9 +/-1.5% of the native FA consumed by rats. Glucuronoconjugates and sulfoconjugates represented 0.5 +/- 0.3 and 32.7 +/- 7.3%, respectively. These results suggested that a part of FA incorporated in the diet was quickly absorbed and largely metabolized in sulfoconjugates before excretion in urine.",1
"Antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts from several asparagus cultivars Three different methods (antiradical activity, inhibition of primary oxidation, and ferric reducing power) have been used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of eight different asparagus cultivars and byproducts: white and green asparagus from Alcalá del Río (Guadalquivir Valley, Seville) and American hybrids, native spears, and their byproducts from Huétor-Tájar (Vega de Granada). The correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenol content was studied. Six standards were also tested to validate the modified methods for antioxidant activity determination. Results obtained for antiradical capacity and reducing power were very similar, and a high correlation with phenols was found (R > or = 0.9 for both tests). Sample origin was an important factor, spears from Huétor-Tájar having higher values (ARC between 7 and 10 and P(R) of 0.25-0.33) than those from Alcalá del Río (ARC 0.6-2 and P(R) of 0.05-0.07). Significant differences were found between spears with the same origin, suggesting that genetics are another factor to take into account. Asparagus inhibits lipid primary oxidation, but no correlation between the inhibition percentage and phenols was observed. Asparagus origin was the only factor that led to significant differences: samples from Huétor-Tájar had higher values (POIC between 18 and 32) than those from Alcalá del Río (POIC of 5-9). Byproducts from the canning industry at Huétor-Tájar were also assayed for antioxidant activity; the results obtained suggested that byproducts could be considered as an excellent source of natural antioxidants.",1
"Identification and quantification of flavonoids in human urine samples by column-switching liquid chromatography coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry A rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS) method is described for the determination and quantification of 12 dietary flavonoid glycosides and aglycons in human urine samples. Chromatographic separation of the analytes of interest was achieved by column-switching, using the first column (a Zorbax 300SB C-3 column) for sample cleanup and eluting the heart-cut flavonoid fraction onto the second column (a Zorbax SB C-18 column) for separation and detection by ultraviolet and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS using single ion monitoring in negative mode. The fragmentor voltage was optimized with regard to maximum abundance of the molecular ion and qualifier ions of the analytes. Calibration graphs were prepared for urine, and good linearity was achieved over a dynamic range of 2.5-1000 ng/mL. The inter- and intraassay coefficients of variation for the analysis of the 12 different flavonoids in quality control urine samples were 12.3% on average (range 11.0-13.7%, n = 24, reproducibility) and the repeatability of the assay were 5.0% (mean, range 0.1-14.8%, n = 12). A subset of 10 urine samples from a human dietary intervention study with high and low flavonoid content was analyzed, and the results are reported.",1
"Determination of proanthocyanidins and catechins in beer and barley by high-performance liquid chromatography with dual-electrode electrochemical detection A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in Ireland.",1

"Hydroxycinnamic Acids as Markers of Italian Blood Orange Juices Extraction, resolution, and determination of the trans-hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were performed in 82 orange juices derived from the most important blood and blond varieties grown in Italy. Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties. The statistical model was used to recognize some mixtures of blood and blond juices.",1
"Health-promoting compounds in broccoli as influenced by refrigerated transport and retail sale period Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate (glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.",0
"Analysis of theaflavins in biological fluids using liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.",1
"Ellagic acid, vitamin C, and total phenolic contents and radical scavenging capacity affected by freezing and frozen storage in raspberry fruit The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency (AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)). The freezing process produced a decrease of AE values in the four cultivars ranging between 4 and 26%. During the frozen storage, the AE values reached after the freezing process remained unchanged.",1
"Bioavailability is improved by enzymatic modification of the citrus flavonoid hesperidin in humans: a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers (n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose (7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.",0

"Changes during storage in conventional and ecological wine: Phenolic content and antioxidant activity Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in conventional and ecological white wine. In contrast with other studies, the total concentrations of phenolic compounds in conventional and ecological red and white wines were not related to antioxidant activity (p > 0.05). In red wines, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity of ecological and conventional red wine (p = 0.28), while in white wine significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity between conventional and ecological white wine (p = 0.006).",1
"Hydroxytyrosol, as a component of olive mill waste water, is dose- dependently absorbed and increases the antioxidant capacity of rat plasma Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo actions.",1

"HPLC-MSn analysis of phenolic compounds and purine alkaloids in green and black tea Tea is a complex mixture containing a range of compounds from simple phenolics to complex thearubigins, many of which have well-recognized antioxidant properties. This paper describes the application of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) methods for the rapid and routine analysis of more than 30 phenolics in tea. Green and black tea infusions were injected directly onto a reversed phase HPLC column, and the phenolics eluted using two different mobile phase gradients, one optimized to resolve catechin derivatives and the other, flavonols and theaflavins. Compounds, identified on the basis of their retention time, absorbance spectrum, and MS fragmentation pattern, included (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, theaflavin and their various gallate derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol mono-, di-, and triglycosides, quinic acid esters of gallic acid and hydroxycinnamates, and the purine alkaloids, caffeine and theobromine.",1
"Determination of unusual soya and non-soya phytoestrogen sources in beer, fish products and other foods Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices (30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.",1
"Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of oleuropein and its metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma and urine after oral administration We describe a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the secoiridoid oleuropein and its bioactive metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma and urine. Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 mg/kg) of oleuropein.

"Antioxidant Activity of Berry and Fruit Wines and Liquors A total of 44 different berry and fruit wines and liquors with total phenolic contents between 91 and 1820 mg/L, expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE), were evaluated for antioxidant activity. Dealcoholized wine extracts were added to methyl linoleate (MeLo), and the oxidation in the dark at 40 degrees C was followed by conjugated diene measurement. Wines made of mixtures of black currants and crowberries or bilberries (240-275 µM GAE) were slightly superior to reference red grape wines (330-375 µM GAE) and equally as active as the control antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (50 µM), in inhibiting MeLo hydroperoxide formation. Also, raw materials including apple, arctic bramble, cowberries, cranberries, red currants, or rowanberries possessed antioxidant activity. Thus, these raw materials contain phenolic compounds, some of which are capable of protecting lipids against oxidation also in a hydrophobic lipid system. Liquors, apart from arctic bramble liquor, were less active than wines. However, the total phenolic content did not correlate with the antioxidant activity of the berry and fruit wines and liquors, therefore alleviating the importance of further characterization of the phenolic antioxidants present in berry and fruit wines.",1
"Olive oil phenolics are dose-dependently absorbed in humans Olive oil phenolic constituents have been shown, in vitro, to be endowed with potent biological activities including, but not limited to, an antioxidant action. To date, there is no information on the absorption and disposition of such compounds in humans. We report that olive oil phenolics, namely tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, are dose-dependently absorbed in humans after ingestion and that they are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, an increase in the dose of phenolics administered increased the proportion of conjugation with glucuronide.",1
"Quantitation of the lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in baked goods containing flax seed or flax meal Samples of commercially prepared white, whole wheat, flax, and multigrain breads were analyzed by a rapid RP-HPLC method for the presence of the lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). SDG was detected only in products containing flax, with concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 1.98 microM/g of DW (19-602 microM/loaf). Full-fat flax meal, powdered aqueous alcohol extracts of flax seed, and SDG were added to a white bread mix and baked into loaves in a domestic bread maker. Quantitative recovery of SDG from the test breads was observed when SDG was added; however, when flax meal or aqueous alcohol extracts were added, only 73-75% of the theoretical yield of SDG was recovered. SDG was also detected in commercially prepared flax cookies, bagels, and muffins with concentrations ranging from 0.26 to 2.93 microM/g of DW. The extent of grinding of the flax seed was also shown to have a significant effect on the recovery of SDG from both flax meal breads and baked goods, with extraction of SDG from finely ground samples greater than that from course material.",1
"Rapid reversed phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the major cocoa polyphenols and inter-relationships of their concentrations in chocolate Chocolate and other cocoa-containing products are a rich source of polyphenols. This paper describes an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method that can separate and quantify in 3 min six of the major chocolate polyphenols: catechin; epicatechin; B2 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); B5 (epicatechin-4beta-6-epicatechin); C1 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); and tetramer D (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin). A survey of 68 chocolate samples indicated that there was a strongly predictive relationship between epicatechin and the other individual polyphenols, especially procyanidin B2 (R 2 = 0.989), even though the chocolates came from varied sources and manufacturers. The relationship was less strong with catechin, and so further work to explore the reasons for this difference was performed. Chiral analysis on a subset of 23 chocolates showed that (-)-epicatechin had a predictive relationship with (+)-catechin in line with the other polyphenols, but not with (-)-catechin (the predominant form). This indicates that (-)-catechin is the most affected by manufacturing conditions, possibly formed through epimerization from (-)-epicatechin during processing. The results show that epicatechin concentrations can be used to predict the content of other polyphenols, especially B2 and C1, and total polyphenols content. Finally, the (-)-catechin content is not predictable from the epicatechin content, and it is concluded that this is the main form of polyphenol that varies according to manufacturing conditions and cocoa origin.",1
"Polyphenolic profiles in eight apple cultivars using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in health-promoting physiological functions.",1

"Bioavailability of multiple components following acute ingestion of a polyphenol-rich juice drink A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different plant-derived foods.",1

"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations in fruit and leaf tissues of highbush blueberry Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.",0
"Resveratrol, pterostilbene, and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries A study was conducted to determine the presence of resveratrol, pterostilbene, and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries. Samples representing selections and cultivars of 10 species from Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, and Canada were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resveratrol was found in Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry), Vaccinium arboretum (sparkleberry), Vaccinium ashei (rabbiteye blueberry), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush blueberry), Vaccinium elliottii (Elliott's blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium stamineum (deerberry), Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.",0
"Chemical composition and flavor of Ecuadorian cocoa liquor The contribution of the chemical composition to the flavor of cocoa liquor from an Ecuadorian selfed population of clone EET 95 was investigated. Polyphenols, purine alkaloids, organic acids, and sugars were quantified, and the key sensory characteristics of cocoa were scored by a trained panel. Despite the short bean fermentation (2 days) commonly used for Arriba cocoa, acetic acid content was closely correlated to liquor pH, demonstrating its essential role in cocoa liquor acidification. Polyphenols were positively correlated to astringency, bitterness, and the green note and negatively correlated to the fruity character. Alkaloid and polyphenol levels fluctuated significantly within the selfed progeny and tended to be lower than those of the heterozygous clone EET 95 (inbreeding effect). These results support the idea that polyphenols might be essential to the overall perception of cocoa liquor characteristics and indicate that the composition and the sensory quality of cocoa liquor are the result of both a genotypic contribution and the conditions of fermentation and roasting.",1
"Changes in phenolic profile and antioxidant activity during production of diced tomatoes Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants and phenolics during the dice-making process.",1

"Determination of anthocyanins in wine by direct injection liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry and classification of wines using discriminant analysis A rapid HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed for the routine analysis of 16 anthocyanins in wine. Direct injection of filtered wine samples followed by selective detection at 520 nm allowed quantitation of these compounds in red wines. The method was linear for malvidin-3-glucoside over the range 5-250ppm, and the limit of detection for this compound was 0.18 ppm. A volatile mobile phase is used, which enables hyphenation to mass spectrometry (MS). With HPLC-MS, a total of 44 pigments could be identified in South African wines. Obtained mass spectra are discussed for a series of representative wine constituents and results are compared with literature references. An attempt was made to differentiate between different cultivars according to the anthocyanin content using stepwise forward linear discriminant analysis (LDA).",1
"Phenolic glucosides in bread containing flaxseed Three phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, were analyzed in commercial breads containing flaxseed. The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.",1

"Bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones in humans: impact of a full-fat yogurt The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released aglycones.",0

"Development of analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtilus) anthocyanins in human plasma and urine Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that may possess chronic disease preventive properties. Here, rapid, reliable, and reproducible solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry techniques are described for the isolation, separation, and identification of anthocyanins in human plasma and urine. Recoveries of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were 91% from water, 71% from plasma, and 81% from urine. Intra- and interday variations for C3G extraction were 9 and 9.1% in plasma and 7.1 and 9.1% in urine and were less than 15% for all anthocyanins from a standardized bilberry extract (mirtoselect). Analysis of mirtoselect by HPLC with UV detection produced spectra with 15 peaks compatible with anthocyanin components found in mirtoselect within a total run time of 15 min. Chromatographic analysis of human urine obtained after an oral dose of mirtoselect yielded 19 anthocyanin peaks. Mass spectrometric analysis employing multiple reaction monitoring suggests the presence of unchanged anthocyanins and anthocyanidin glucuronide metabolites.",1

"Daidzein and genistein content of fruits and nuts Dietary phytoestrogens such as the isoflavones daidzein and genistein are thought to protect against chronic diseases that are common in Western societies, such as cancer, osteoporosis, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, there are concerns regarding the deleterious effects of hormone-like compounds, especially with respect to the development of infants. However, there is little information regarding the phytoestrogen content of foods, and therefore epidemiologic investigations of phytoestrogens are limited. As part of a study quantifying the consumption of phytoestrogens, the objective of this work was to assess the daidzein and genistein content of fruits and nuts commonly eaten in Europe. Eighty different fruits and nuts were sampled, prepared for eating, and freeze-dried. Daidzein and genistein were extracted from the dried foods, and the two isoflavones were quantified after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. Completeness of extraction and any procedural losses of the isoflavones were accounted for using synthetic daidzin (7-O-glucosyl-4'-hydroxyisoflavone) and genistin (7-O-glucosyl-4'5-dihydroxyisoflavone) as internal standards. Of the 80 foods assayed, 43 contained no detectable daidzein or genistein, at a limit of quantification of 1 microg/kg dry weight of food. Nine foods contained more than 100 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram wet weight, and 28 contained less than this amount. Currants and raisins were the richest sources of the isoflavones, containing 2,250 microg and 1,840 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram of wet weight of food. Although fruits and nuts are not as rich in isoflavone phytoestrogens as are soy and other legumes, this is the first documentation of levels of daidzein and genistein occurring in these foods.",1
"Reliability of analytical methods for determining anthocyanins in blood orange juices Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed on a series of blood orange juices according to various spectrophotometric and HPLC methods, and the causes for different concentration resulting from the application of such procedures were investigated. Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice producing factories.",1

"Isolation, structure elucidation and antioxidant potential of the major phenolic and flavonoid compounds in brined olive drupes Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of cancer chemopreventive activity.",1

"Urinary lignan and isoflavonoid excretion in premenopausal women consuming flaxseed powder Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids (daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan matairesinol with flaxseed.

"Simultaneous quantification of oleuropein and its metabolites in rat plasma by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry Oleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea and possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite the plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of olive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been published to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its major metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites hydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid in rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after enzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for all compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were linear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method exhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection was in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the nanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method was simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the simultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat plasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well as bioavailability and metabolism studies.",0
"Potential antioxidants in beer assessed by ESR spin trapping A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.",1
"Determination of daidzein and genistein in soybean foods by automated on-line in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography An automated on-line method for the determination of the isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, was developed using in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (in-tube SPME-HPLC). In-tube SPME is a new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were above 97%.",1

Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a nutritional point of view.",1
"Biophenols in table olives Unprocessed olives are well-known sources of phenolic antioxidants with important biological properties. Processing methods to prepare table olives may cause a reduction of valuable phenols and may deprive the food of precious biological functions. The present work was undertaken to evaluate table olives produced in Greece as sources of biophenols. Commercially available olives were analyzed for their total phenol content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and for individual phenols by RP-HPLC. Samples were Spanish-style green olives in brine, Greek-style naturally black olives in brine, and Kalamata olives in brine. Most of the types of olives analyzed were found to be good sources of phenols. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and luteolin were the prevailing phenols in almost all of the samples examined. High levels of hydroxytyrosol were determined mainly in Kalamata olives and Spanish-style green olives, cultivar Chalkidiki (250-760 mg/kg).",0

"The C-glycosyl flavonoid, aspalathin, is absorbed, methylated and glucuronidated intact in humans Human bioavailability of the flavonoid dihydrochalcones is little understood, and no evidence exists for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption in humans. The present study uses catechol-O-methyltransferase to generate methylated metabolites of aspalathin (a C-glycosyl dihydrochalcone from rooibos tea). One of the methylated forms, both with and without glucuronidation, was detected using LC-MS/MS in the urine of human subjects (n = 6), demonstrating that deglycosylation is not a prerequisite for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption. Methylation is catalysed by both intestine and liver cytosolic extracts. The results show that flavonoid C-glycosides are methylated and glucuronidated in vivo in an intact form in humans.",1

"Determination of piceid and resveratrol in Spanish wines deriving from Monastrell (Vitis vinifera L.) grape variety The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L (average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types of wines.",1

"Flavonol content varies among black currant cultivars Flavonoids and related plant compounds in fruits and vegetables are of particular importance as they have been found to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. The HPLC-based quantitative procedure, with improved extraction and hydrolysis, was used to analyze the content of the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 10 black currant cultivars from organic farms and in 5 cultivars from conventional farms. Myricetin was the most abundant flavonol, and its amount varied significantly among cultivars, from 8.9 to 24.5 mg x 100 g(-1) (fresh weight). The quercetin levels in black currant also varied widely among the cultivars, from 5.2 to 12.2 mg x 100 g(-1). The kaempferol levels in black currant cultivars were low, ranging from 0.9 to 2.3 mg x 100 g(-1). The sum of these major flavonols varied widely among black currant cultivars. No consistent differences in the contents of flavonols were found between the same black currant cultivars grown in organic and conventional ways. The high variability in the levels of flavonols in different cultivars offers possible avenues for identifying and selecting cultivars rich in certain flavonols for the special production of berries for industrial use.",0
"Chemical composition and oxidative stability of flax, safflower and poppy seed and seed oils Three seeds of Turkish origin, flax, poppy and safflower were analyzed for their proximate, fatty acids, tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and total phenolic composition, and oxidative stability of their oil. The major fatty acid in the flax oil was alpha-linolenic acid, comprising 58.3% of total fatty acids, whereas poppy and safflower oils were rich in linoleic acid at 74.5% and 70.5% level, respectively. The amount of total tocols was 14.6 mg/100g flax, 11.0mg/100g poppy and 12.1mg/100g safflower seed. Flax and poppy oil were rich in gamma-tocopherol as 79.4 mg/100g oil and 30.9 mg/100g oil, respectively, while alpha-tocopherol (44.1g/100g oil) was dominant in safflower oil. Only alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol were found in the oils. Oxidative stability of oils was measured at 110 degrees C at the rate of 20 L/h air flow rate, and poppy oil (5.56 h) was most stabile oil followed by safflower oil (2.87 h) and flax oil (1.57). There were no correlation between oxidative stability and unsaturation degree of fatty acids and tocol levels of the oils. All of the seeds investigated provide a healthy oil profile and may have potential as a source of specialty oils on a commercial scale.",0
"Absorption of phenolic acids in humans after coffee consumption Despite extensive literature describing the biological effects of polyphenols, little is known about their absorption from diet, one major unresolved point consisting of the absorption of the bound forms of polyphenols. In this view, in the present work we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from coffee, a common beverage particularly rich in bound phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Coffee brew was analyzed for free and total (free + bound) phenolic acids. Chlorogenic acid (5'-caffeoylquinic acid), a bound form of caffeic acid, was present in coffee at high levels, while free phenolic acids were undetectable. After alkaline hydrolysis, which released bound phenolic acids, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and high levels of caffeic acid were detected. Plasma samples were collected before and 1 and 2 h after coffee administration and analyzed for free and total phenolic acid content. Two different procedures were applied to release bound phenolic acids in plasma: beta-glucuronidase treatment and alkaline hydrolysis. Coffee administration resulted in increased total plasma caffeic acid concentration, with an absorption peak at 1 h. Caffeic acid was the only phenolic acid found in plasma samples after coffee administration, while chlorogenic acid was undetectable. Most of caffeic acid was present in plasma in bound form, mainly in the glucuronate/sulfate forms. Due to the absence of free caffeic acid in coffee, plasma caffeic acid is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid in the gastrointestinal tract.",1
"Determination of coumarin, vanillin, and ethyl vanillin in vanilla extract products: liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method development and validation studies A LC-MS method was developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin, and ethyl vanillin in vanilla products. Samples were analyzed using LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS in the positive ionization mode. Limits of detection for the method ranged from 0.051 to 0.073 microg mL(-1). Using the optimized method, 24 vanilla products were analyzed. All samples tested negative for coumarin. Concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 8.59 mg mL(-1) (x =3.73) for vanillin and 0.33 to 2.27 mg mL(-1) (x =1.03) for ethyl vanillin. The measured concentrations are compared to values calculated using UV monitoring and to results reported in a similar survey in 1988. Analytical results, method precision, and accuracy data are presented.",1
"Bioavailability of isoflavones after ingestion of soy beverages in healthy adults It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.",1
"Identification of flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans (Vigna sinensis) by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.",1
"Occurrence of anthocyanin-derived pigments in red wines Several anthocyanin-derived pigments that showed UV-visible spectra different from those of the original grape anthocyanins were detected by HPLC-DAD analysis in 1-year-old bottled Port wines from the Douro region. Among these, three malvidin 3-glucoside derived pigments were detected in large amounts, representing approximately 60% of the total anthocyanidin monoglucosides content. These pigments were isolated, purified, and identified by LSI-MS and NMR ((1)H, DQF-COSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) techniques. The major pigment is malvidin 3-glucoside pyruvic adduct, previously characterized, and the other two corresponded to its respective acetyl and coumaroyl glucoside derivatives. The latter is reported for the first time in red wines.",0

"Identification of urinary metabolites of the red clover isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A in human subjects Dietary supplements manufactured from red clover are widely marketed to provide the beneficial health effects of isoflavones without changing the original diet. In this study the metabolism of formononetin and biochanin A, the principal isoflavones of red clover, was studied in human subjects. Seven women ingested four red clover dietary supplements, and the metabolites of the isoflavones were identified in their urine samples. The structures of trimethylsilyl derivatives of the metabolites were established by GC-MS. New reduced metabolites of formononetin (dihydroformononetin and angolensin) and biochanin A (dihydrobiochanin A and 6'-hydroxyangolensin) were identified in urine samples using authentic reference compounds. Possible metabolic pathways are presented for the red clover isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A.",1

"Evaluation of propolis polyphenols absorption in humans by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether (P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.",0
"Effect of Various Compounds on Virgin Olive Oil Stability Measured by Rancimat Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.",0
"Flavonoids in baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.): changes during plant growth and storage The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds enhanced.",1

"The phenolic fraction of maize bran: evidence for lignin-heteroxylan association Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.",0
"Identification of puerarin and its metabolites in rats by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.",1
"Antioxidant activity in common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Beans were pearled to evaluate the feasibility of increasing antioxidant activity and phenolic antioxidants. Phenolics were concentrated mostly in the hull fraction at about 56 mg of catechin equivalents per gram of sample. The methanolic extracts of the pearled bean samples were screened for antioxidant potential using the beta-carotene-linoleate and the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. The pearled material, also referred to as milled samples, exhibited antioxidant activity that correlated with phenolic content and inhibited DPPH significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Phenolics and antioxidant activities were also examined in chromatographic fractions of methanolic extracts of manually obtained hulls that represented a model used previously to ascertain antimutagenic activity. Fractions extracted with ethyl acetate/acetone and acetone displayed antioxidant activity, which implies potent free radical scavenging activity with antimutagenic activity.",0
"Absorption, excretion and metabolite profiling of methyl-, glucuronyl-, glucosyl- and sulpho-conjugates of quercetin in human plasma and urine after ingestion of onions It is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary flavonols to understand their role in disease prevention. Lightly fried onions containing 275 micromol flavonols, principally quercetin-4'-glucoside and quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, were fed to healthy human volunteers and plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Samples were analysed by HPLC with diode array and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Five flavonol metabolites, quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide, a quercetin diglucuronide and a quercetin glucuronide sulphate, were detected in plasma in quantifiable amounts with trace quantities of six additional quercetin metabolites. Sub-micromolar peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were observed 0.6-0.8 h after ingestion. In contrast, the Cmax of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 2.5 h. The elimination half-lives (t1/2) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were 1.71, 2.33 and 1.76 h respectively, while the t1/2 of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide was 5.34 h and that of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 4.54 h. The profile of metabolites excreted in urine was markedly different to that of plasma with many of the major urinary components, including quercetin-3'-glucuronide, two quercetin glucoside sulphates and a methylquercetin diglucuronide, absent or present in only trace amounts in the bloodstream indicative of substantial phase II metabolism. Total urinary excretion of quercetin metabolites was 12.9 micromol, corresponding to 4.7 % of intake. If these samples had been subjected to hydrolysis, as in many previous studies, only quercetin and isorhamnetin would have been detected and quantified. The bioactivity of these metabolites should be considered.",1
"Extraction and quantification of phytoestrogens in foods using automated solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.",0

"Absorption, metabolism, and excretion of cider dihydrochalcones in healthy humans and subjects with an ileostomy The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 38.6% of intake.",0
"Effect of variety, processing, and storage on the flavonoid glycoside content and composition of lettuce and endive Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive (Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of flavonoids in salads.",0
"Analyses of polyphenols in cacao liquor, cocoa, and chocolate by normal-phase and reversed-phase HPLC The antioxidant polyphenols in cacao liquor, a major ingredient of chocolate and cocoa, have been characterized as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidin oligomers. In this study, various cacao products were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC, and the profiles and quantities of the polyphenols present, grouped by molecular size (monomers to approximately oligomers), were compared. Individual cacao polyphenols, flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin), and dimeric (procyanidin B2), trimeric (procyanidin C1), and tetrameric (cinnamtannin A2) proanthocyanidins, and galactopyranosyl-ent-(-)-epicatechin (2alpha-->7, 4alpha-->8)-(-)-epicatechin (Gal-EC-EC), were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and/or HPLC/MS. The profile of monomers (catechins) and proanthocyanidin in dark chocolate was similar to that of cacao liquor, while the ratio of flavan-3-ols to the total amount of monomeric and oligomeric polyphenols in the case of pure cocoa powder was higher than that in the case of cacao liquor or chocolate.",1

"Effect of roasting on the formation of chlorogenic acid lactones in coffee Of all plant constituents, coffee has one of the highest concentrations of chlorogenic acids. When roasting coffee, some of these are transformed into chlorogenic acid lactones (CGL). We have studied the formation of CGL during the roasting of coffee beans in Coffea arabica cv. Bourbon; C. arabicacv. Longberry; and C. canephora cv. Robusta. Individual CGL levels were determined by comparison of HPLC peaks with those of synthetic CGL standards. Seven CGL were identified: 3-caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-CQL), 4- caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-CQL), 3-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-pCoQL), 4-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-pCoQL), 3-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-FQL), 4-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-FQL), and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-diCQL). 3-CQL was the most abundant lactone in C. arabica and C. canephora, reaching peak values of 230 +/- 9 and 254 +/- 4 mg/100 g (dry weight), respectively, at light medium roast ( approximately 14% weight loss). 4-CQL was the second most abundant lactone (116 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 mg/100 g, respectively. The maximum amount of CGL represents approximately 30% of the available precursors. The relative levels of 3-CQL and 4-CQL in roasted coffee were reverse to those of their precursors in green coffee. This suggests that roasting causes isomerization of chlorogenic acids prior to the formation of lactones and that the levels of lactones in roasted coffee do not reflect the levels of precursors in green coffee.",1
"Relative bioavailability of the flavonoids quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin given simultaneously through diet The bioavailability and urinary excretion of three dietary flavonoids, quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin, were investigated. Ten healthy men were asked to consume a 'juice mix' containing equal amounts of the three flavonoids, and their urine and plasma samples were collected. The resulting mean plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-48 h) and C(max) values for quercetin and hesperetin were similar, whereas the AUC(0-48 h) of naringenin and, thus, the relative bioavailability were higher after consumption of the same dose. The study consolidates a significantly lower urinary excretion of quercetin (1.5+/-1%) compared with hesperetin (14.2+/-9.1%) and naringenin (22.6+/-11.5%) and shows that this is not due to a lower bioavailability of quercetin, but rather reflects different clearance mechanisms.",0
"Antioxidant activity of different phenolic fractions separated from an Italian red wine Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.",1
"Urinary excretion of black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) anthocyanins and their metabolites Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of cyanidin-3-rutinoside.",1
"Identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in rat urine by HPLC-MS(n) This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found and identified in rat urine for the first time.",1
"LC-MS/MS determination of naringin, hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum after orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus aurantii To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).",1
"Identification of nobiletin metabolites in mouse urine Nobiletin, a major component of citrus polymethoxyflavones, has many potential significant health benefits. While the biological activities of nobiletin have been widely reported, its in vitro and in vivo metabolic fate has been rarely studied. To explore the biotransformation mechanism of nobiletin we conducted an investigation into its metabolic profile in mouse urine, by various analytical techniques. Due to sample amount limitations for isolating and characterizing an individual metabolite, two possible nobiletin metabolites were prepared in a similar multi-step organic synthetic route: 3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (3'-demethylnobiletin) and 4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxyflavone (4'-demethylnobiletin). Normal phase (silica gel) and C(18) reverse phase chromatography, as well as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry, were employed in the separation of 3'-demethylnobiletin and 4'-demethylnobiletin, however, without success due to the structural similarities of these mono-demethylated nobiletins. Using a chiral packed column eluted under supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) conditions, a clear separation was achieved. Thus, by comparing the SFC profiles of metabolite mixtures with the synthesized standard compounds, the major nobiletin metabolite of mouse urine is identified as 4'-demethylnobiletin, whereas 3'-demethylnobiletin is a minor metabolite. In this study, the concentration of 4'-demethylnobiletin in mouse urine is 28.9 microg/mL.",1
"Influence of cultivar on quality parameters and chemical composition of strawberry fruits grown in Brazil Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 (cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289 (mean 221) mg/100 g.",0
"High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed by alkaline extraction A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside (1.6-5.0 mg/g).",0
"Compositional changes induced by UV-B radiation treatment of common bean and soybean seedlings monitored by capillary electrophoresis with diode array detection In this work, a new CE method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for the monitoring and quantitation of flavonoids in different beans treated and untreated with UV-B radiation. Flavonoid concentration was monitored in UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively. The proposed method shows (i) the potentialities of bean sprouts as a natural source of bioactive compounds (antioxidants); (ii) the technological role of UV-B treatment for sprout isoflavone enrichment; and (iii) the good capabilities of CE-DAD to monitor this process.",1

"Phenolic acids from beer are absorbed and extensively metabolized in humans In spite of the wide literature describing the biological effects of phenolic compounds, scarce data are available on their absorption from diet. In the present work, we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from beer, a common beverage rich in different phenolic acids with related chemical structures. Beer was analyzed for free and total (free+bound) phenolic acids. Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were present in beer mainly as bound forms, while 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid were present mainly as free forms. Vanillic acid was present equally in the free and bound forms. Plasma samples were collected before and 30 and 60 min after beer administration and analyzed for free and conjugated phenolic acid content. A significant two- to fourfold increase in plasma levels of phenolic acids was detected with peak concentrations at 30 min after beer ingestion. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid was present in plasma mainly as nonconjugated forms while p-coumaric acid was present equally as nonconjugated and conjugated forms. Ferulic, vanillic and caffeic acids were present in plasma predominantly as conjugated forms, with a slight prevalence of sulfates with respect to glucuronates. Our results indicate that phenolic acids from beer are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are present in blood after being largely metabolized to the form of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The extent of conjugation is related to the chemical structure of phenolic acids: the monohydroxy derivatives showing the lowest conjugation degree and the dihydroxy derivatives showing the highest one.",1
"Quantification of the predominant monomeric catechins in baking chocolate standard reference material by LC/APCI-MS Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference Material.",0
"Antioxidant effect of two virgin olive oils depends on the concentration and composition of minor polar compounds In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins (LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should specify the oils used.",1
"Rapid high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of virgin olive oil phenolic metabolites in human low-den A rapid method for detection and quantification of metabolites of specific olive oil phenolic compounds (hydroxytyrosol monoglucuronide, hydroxytyrosol monosulfate, tyrosol glucuronide, tyrosol sulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate) in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) is described. A 3 microm particle size fast C18 Luna column, 5 cm x 2.0 mm I.D., was used at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B). A linear gradient profile was used for separation at column temperature 40 degrees C. The proposed chromatographic procedure is rapid without loosing its separation efficiency and sensitivity. Validation proofs were carried out for the method described, showing a linear system (r>0.99) and a recovery of 81.9 and 101.3% for hydroxytyrosol and homovanillic acid, respectively. The results show that this method is effective and can be used in routine analysis.",1
"Antioxidant activity and phenolic content of Oregon caneberries Five types of caneberries [evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), marionberries (Rubus ursinus), boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus), red raspberries (Rubus idaeus), and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)] were analyzed for antioxidant activity by measuring their oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). In addition, the berries were analyzed for total phenolics, anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ellagic acid content. All of the berries had high ORAC activity ranging from 24 to 77.2 micromol of Trolox equiv/g of fresh berries. Anthocyanin content ranged from 0.65 to 5.89 mg/g, and phenolics ranged from 4.95 to 9.8 mg/g. Black raspberries had the highest ORAC and anthocyanin and phenolic contents. Only red raspberries had detectable amounts of procyanidin oligomers (monomer, dimers, and trimers). All berries had high levels of ellagic acid (47-90 mg/g), but boysenberries had the highest level prior to hydrolysis. The results from this study indicate that these caneberries were high in antioxidant activity and were rich sources of anthocyanins and phenolics.",1
Processing of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sorghum products alters procyanidin oligomer and polymer distribution and content Sorghum procyanidins were characterized and quantified from two brown sorghum varieties and their processed products by normal phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The DP of the procyanidins was determined by thiolysis. Quantification was done by using purified oligomeric and polymeric cocoa procyanidins as external standards. Sorghum procyanidins were composed mostly of high MW (DP > 10) polymers. Significant differences were observed in levels as well as distribution of the different MW procyanidins between the sorghums. Processing of the sorghum brans into cookies and bread significantly reduced the levels of procyanidins; this effect was more pronounced in the higher MW polymers. Cookies had a higher retention of procyanidins (42-84%) than bread (13-69%). Extrusion of sorghum grain resulted in an increase in the levels of procyanidin oligomers with DP </= 4 and decrease in polymers with DP >/= 6. This suggests a possible breakdown of the high MW polymers to the lower MW constituents during extrusion. Processing changes not only the content of procyanidins in sorghum products but also the relative ratio of the different molecular weights.,0
"Identification and quantification of flavonoids in human urine samples by column-switching liquid chromatography coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry A rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS) method is described for the determination and quantification of 12 dietary flavonoid glycosides and aglycons in human urine samples. Chromatographic separation of the analytes of interest was achieved by column-switching, using the first column (a Zorbax 300SB C-3 column) for sample cleanup and eluting the heart-cut flavonoid fraction onto the second column (a Zorbax SB C-18 column) for separation and detection by ultraviolet and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS using single ion monitoring in negative mode. The fragmentor voltage was optimized with regard to maximum abundance of the molecular ion and qualifier ions of the analytes. Calibration graphs were prepared for urine, and good linearity was achieved over a dynamic range of 2.5-1000 ng/mL. The inter- and intraassay coefficients of variation for the analysis of the 12 different flavonoids in quality control urine samples were 12.3% on average (range 11.0-13.7%, n = 24, reproducibility) and the repeatability of the assay were 5.0% (mean, range 0.1-14.8%, n = 12). A subset of 10 urine samples from a human dietary intervention study with high and low flavonoid content was analyzed, and the results are reported.",0
"Absorption and metabolism of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside in rats We have clarified for the first time how cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (C3G), which is a potent antioxidant anthocyanin, is absorbed and metabolized in vivo. Rats were orally administered C3G (0.9 mmol/kg body weight), and C3G rapidly appeared in the plasma. However, the aglycon of C3G (cyanidin; Cy) was not detected, although it was present in the jejunum. Protocatechuic acid (PC), which may be produced by degradation of Cy, was present in the plasma and the concentration was 8-fold higher than that of C3G. These results suggest that plasma PC and C3G may contribute to the antioxidant activity of the plasma. In the liver and kidney, C3G was metabolized to methylated C3G (methyl-C3G), suggesting that C3G and/or methyl-C3G act as antioxidants in the tissues.",1
"Antioxidant properties of commercial alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages Recent interest in food phenolics has increased greatly, because of their antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Popular beverages in the world include tea, coffee, cocoa, beer, wine and fruit/vegetable juices. All of these beverages contain phenolic compounds. In present study total polyphenol content and in vitro antioxidant properties were investigated in 16 red wines, 5 white wines, 5 lager beers, 3 dark beers, 17 fruit juices and 5 vegetable juices. High polyphenol content was measured in red wines (1720 +/- 546 mg x L(-1)) and in some fruit juices such as elderberry and prunes (5,680 and 1,807 mg x L(-1), respectively). The concentration of polyphenols was between 159 and 5,680 mg x L(-1) in fruit juices and between 255 and 696 mg x L(-1) in vegetable ones, while low level of phenolics was observed in dark and lager beers and white wines (473, 376 and 392 mg x L(-1), respectively). All samples exhibited significant antioxidant properties such as hydrogen-donating ability, reducing power, chelating ability and total antioxidant status (TAS) value. These antioxidant properties strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content of the beverages.",1
"Bioavailability and antioxidant effects of orange juice components in humans Seven healthy females and six males consumed daily 256 mg of vitamin C, 271 mg of flavanones (mainly as glycosides), 6 mg of carotenoids (mainly xanthophylls and cryptoxanthins), and 0.16 mg of folate by incorporation of daily three times 236 mL of not from concentrate orange juice (OJ) into their habitual diet. At the end of 3 weeks, mean vitamin C, folate, carotenoid, and flavanone plasma concentrations increased significantly relative to baseline by 59% (p < 0.001), 46% (p = 0.018), and 22% (p < 0.001), and 8-fold (p = 0.045), respectively. Flavanones were excreted in urine 9-fold more at the end of the intervention (p = 0.01) but returned to baseline 2 days after study completion. After the 3 week intervention, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E did not change. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine in white blood cells declined by 16% (p = 0.38; n = 11), and in individuals with high baseline concentrations by 29% (p = 0.36; n = 7), respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratios decreased but cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance plasma concentrations did not change significantly. We conclude from this pilot study that OJ is an excellent food source to enhance circulating concentrations of valuable hydrophilic as well as lipophilic phytochemicals.",1
"Effects of Genetic, Pre- and Post-Harvest Factors on Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Capacity of White Asparagus Spears The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.",0

"Curcumin content of turmeric and curry powders Curcumin, derived from the rhizome curcuma longa, is one of the primary ingredients in turmeric and curry powders that are used as spices in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, especially on the Indian subcontinent. More recently, laboratory studies have demonstrated that dietary curcumin exhibits various biological activities and significantly inhibits colon tumorigenesis and tumor size in animals. Curcumin displays both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, giving it the potential to be considered in the development of cancer preventive strategies and applications in clinical research. Experimental studies have shown the biological activities of the compound, but much more information on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and food content are needed. Whether the amount of curcumin in turmeric and curry powders is sufficient to suggest effects on biological activities and cancer risk is unknown. To determine and compare the quantitative amounts of curcumin that are present in several brands of turmeric and curry powders, a high performance liquid chromatography technique was used to analyze 28 spice products described as turmeric or curry powders and two negative controls. Pure turmeric powder had the highest curcumin concentration, averaging 3.14% by weight. The curry powder samples, with one exception, had relatively small amounts of curcumin present, and the variability in content was great. The curcumin content of these seasoning products that are consumed as a component of the diet should be considered in evaluating baseline tissue concentration and response to curcumin supplementation, which is under study in chemoprevention trials.",1
"Flavonol content varies among black currant cultivars Flavonoids and related plant compounds in fruits and vegetables are of particular importance as they have been found to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. The HPLC-based quantitative procedure, with improved extraction and hydrolysis, was used to analyze the content of the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 10 black currant cultivars from organic farms and in 5 cultivars from conventional farms. Myricetin was the most abundant flavonol, and its amount varied significantly among cultivars, from 8.9 to 24.5 mg x 100 g(-1) (fresh weight). The quercetin levels in black currant also varied widely among the cultivars, from 5.2 to 12.2 mg x 100 g(-1). The kaempferol levels in black currant cultivars were low, ranging from 0.9 to 2.3 mg x 100 g(-1). The sum of these major flavonols varied widely among black currant cultivars. No consistent differences in the contents of flavonols were found between the same black currant cultivars grown in organic and conventional ways. The high variability in the levels of flavonols in different cultivars offers possible avenues for identifying and selecting cultivars rich in certain flavonols for the special production of berries for industrial use.",1
"Chemical and sensory quality of processed carrot puree as influenced by stress-induced phenolic compounds Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.",1
