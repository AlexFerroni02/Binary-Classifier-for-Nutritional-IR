"T lymphocyte acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is frequently associated with increased expression of the E protein transcription factor inhibitors TAL1 and LYL1. In mouse models, ectopic expression of Tal1 or Lyl1 in T cell progenitors or inactivation of E2a, is sufficient to predispose mice to develop T-ALL. How E2a suppresses thymocyte transformation is currently unknown. Here, we show that early deletion of",0
"Limited prognostic factors have been associated with overall survival (OS) post-relapse in childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Patients enrolled on 12 Children's Oncology Group frontline ALL trials (1996-2014) were analyzed to assess for additional prognostic factors associated with OS post-relapse. Among 16,115 patients, 2053 (12.7%) relapsed. Relapse rates were similar for B-ALL (12.5%) and T-ALL (11.2%) while higher for infants (34.2%). Approximately 50% of B-ALL relapses occurred late (≥36 months) and 72.5% involved the marrow. Conversely, 64.8% of T-ALL relapses occurred early (<18 months) and 47.1% involved the central nervous system. The 5-year OS post-relapse for the entire cohort was 48.9 ± 1.2%; B-ALL:52.5 ± 1.3%, T-ALL:35.5 ± 3.3%, and infant ALL:21.5 ± 3.9%. OS varied by early, intermediate and late time-to-relapse; 25.8 ± 2.4%, 49.5 ± 2.2%, and 66.4 ± 1.8% respectively for B-ALL and 29.8 ± 3.9%, 33.3 ± 7.6%, 58 ± 9.8% for T-ALL. Patients with ETV6::RUNX1 or Trisomy 4 + 10 had median time-to-relapse of 43 months and higher OS post-relapse 74.4 ± 3.1% and 70.2 ± 3.6%, respectively. Patients with hypodiploidy, KMT2A-rearrangement, and TCF3::PBX1 had short median time-to-relapse (12.5-18 months) and poor OS post-relapse (14.2 ± 6.1%, 31.9 ± 7.7%, 36.8 ± 6.6%). Site-of-relapse varied by cytogenetic subtype. This large dataset provided the opportunity to identify risk factors for OS post-relapse to inform trial design and highlight populations with dismal outcomes post-relapse.",0
"Peanuts have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals, particularly isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) and trans-resveratrol. Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.",1
"musculoskeletal involvement of the extremities is common in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The insidious and oligosymptomatic presentation of several musculoskeletal conditions in these patients often leads to different diagnostic suspicions, which may delay appropriate management of the pathology. Non-albicans Candida osteoarticular infections are a rare entity that may affect immunodeficient patients. We describe a case of osteoarticular infection caused by an opportunistic fungus in a pediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the second week of rest post-consolidation block. we present a case of a 4-year-old girl diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that developed an elbow infection by Candida tropicalis. Two surgical debridements of the elbow, combined with the administration of antifungals, were required to control the infection. She fully recovered at six months postoperatively and remains without osteoarticular sequelae at three years of follow up. C. tropicalis infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of osteoarticular complications in immunocompromised patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to avoid osteoarticular sequelae. los síntomas musculoesqueléticos en las extremidades son frecuentes en pacientes pediátricos con leucemia linfoblástica aguda. La presentación insidiosa y oligosintomática de distintas afecciones musculoesqueléticas en estos pacientes genera con frecuencia distintas sospechas diagnósticas que pueden retrasar el manejo adecuado de la patología. Las infecciones osteoarticulares por Candida no albicans son una entidad poco frecuente que puede verse en pacientes inmunocomprometidos. Se describe un caso de infección osteoarticular causada por un hongo oportunista en un paciente pediátrico con leucemia linfoblástica aguda en su segunda semana de descanso postbloqueo de consolidación. paciente de cuatro años con antecedente de leucemia linfoblástica aguda en etapa de consolidación, que desarrolla un cuadro oligosintomático de osteomielitis de codo por Candida tropicalis. Se realizaron dos procedimientos quirúrgicos de toilette y desbridamiento del codo asociado a la administración de antifúngicos y antibióticos, presentando una buena evolución a los seis meses postoperatorios sin secuelas óseas luego de tres años de seguimiento. la infección por C. tropicalis debe incluirse en el diagnóstico diferencial de las infecciones osteoarticulares en pacientes inmunocomprometidos. El diagnóstico y tratamiento rápido es primordial para evitar secuelas osteoarticulares.",0
"Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have demonstrated significant efficacy in achieving complete remission (CR) in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, a considerable number of patients experience relapse within 1 year after CAR T-cell therapy, leading to an extremely poor prognosis, particularly in patients without bridging transplantation. In our study, we investigated 42 children with R/R B-ALL who underwent anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy without bridging transplantation at our center. All patients were included in the response analysis and evaluated for survival and toxicity. The cohort that received the CAR T-cell infusion exhibited a 100% CR rate by day 28 (d28). The overall survival (OS) at 4 years was 61.3% ± 8.5%, and the event-free survival (EFS) was 55.9% ± 7.9%, with a median follow-up duration of 50.1 months. Minimal residual disease (MRD) ≥1% was associated with inferior outcomes, resulting in lower 4-year OS (P = .033) and EFS (P = .014) compared to MRD<1%. The incidences of grade ≥3 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity were 26.8% and 23.8%, respectively. Furthermore, MRD≥1% was identified as an independent factor associated with increased severity of CRS and occurrence of neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that reducing the pre-infusion MRD could serve as an effective treatment strategy to enhance the outcomes of CAR T-cell therapy.",0
"Despite progress in the treatment of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and PH + ALL, fewer advancements have been for older adults with PH-negative B-cell ALL. Treatment of this population is mired by higher incidence of poor risk biologic features, increased incidence of medical comorbidities, and higher rates of treatment-related mortality (TRM). Here, we review the difficulties in managing elderly patients with PH-negative ALL. The development of novel agents has brought additional tools to the armamentarium of drugs and has changed the landscape of treatment. More recent clinical trials and future clinical trials focus on blinatumomab, inotuzomab ozogamicin (IO), and/or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) either alone or integrated with dose-reduced chemotherapy regimens. The introduction of novel agents/therapies and incorporation into our current treatment paradigms may finally offer an avenue to improve the dismal outcomes seen in this population.",0
"Despite the successes achieved in recent years in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), high-risk ALL in particular still represents a considerable challenge, with poorer outcomes. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is frequently constitutively activated in ALL and consequently leads to unrestricted cell proliferation, without showing frequent mutations in the most important representatives of the signaling pathway. Recent studies have shown that fine balanced protein expression is a common way to adjust oncogenic B cell directed receptor signaling and to mediate malignant cell proliferation and survival in leukemic cells. Too low expression of inhibitory phosphatases can lead to constitutive signaling of kinases, which are important for cell proliferation and survival. In contrast, marked high expression levels of key phosphatases enable cells with distinct pronounced oncogenic B cell directed receptor signaling to escape negative selection by attenuating signal strength and thus raising the threshold for deletion checkpoint activation. One of the most important B cell receptor-dependent signaling cascades is the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, with its important antagonist SHIP1. However, recent data show that the inositol-5-phosphatase SHIP1 is differentially expressed across the heterogeneity of the ALL subtypes, making the overall therapeutic strategy targeting SHIP1 more complex. The aim of this article is therefore to provide an overview of the current knowledge about SHIP1, its expression in the various subtypes of ALL, its regulation, and the molecules that influence its gene and protein expression, to better understand its role in the pathogenesis of leukemia and other human cancers.",0
Improved survival rate in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) warrants efforts to optimize treatment intensity in good-prognostic groups such as those with high hyperdiploidy (HHD). Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (,0
"TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA) is a class of long noncoding RNAs transcribed from subtelomeric and telomeric regions. TERRA binds to the subtelomeric and telomeric DNA-forming R-loops (DNA-RNA hybrids), which are involved in telomere maintenance and telomerase function, but the role of TERRA in human cells is not well characterized. Here, we comprehensively investigated for the first time TERRA expression in primary human hematopoietic cells from an exploratory cohort of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), patients with telomere biology disorder (TBD), and healthy subjects. TERRA expression was repressed in primary human hematopoietic cells, including healthy donors, patients with ALL, and patients with TBD, irrespective of their telomere length, except for AML. A second cohort comprising 88 patients with AML showed that TERRA was overexpressed in an AML subgroup also characterized by higher R-loop formation, low TERT and RNAseH2 expression, and a paucity of somatic splicing factor mutations. Telomere length did not correlate with TERRA expression levels. To assess the role of TERRA R-loops in AML, we induced R-loop depletion by increasing RNAseH1 expression in 2 AML cell lines. Decreased TERRA R-loops in AML cell lines resulted in increased chemosensitivity to cytarabine. Our findings indicate that TERRA is uniformly repressed in primary human hematopoietic cells but abnormally expressed in an AML subset with low telomerase.",0
"It is known that sunflower seeds are rich in phenols, constituting approximately 1–3 g per 100 g of seeds. The principal phenol is chlorogenic acid (CGA), followed by caffeic acid (CA) and lower quantities of several other compounds. On the contrary, it is known that phenols are present only in trace amounts in cold-pressed sunflower seed oils. In this study, the possibility of improving the oxidative stability of cold-pressed sunflower oil is evaluated using phenolic substances constitutive of seeds. Phenols, extracted from two different dehulled sunflower seed samples, were identified, measured and added to a cold-pressed sunflower oil and compared with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), pure CGA and pure CA. Raw phenolic extract (RPE) was composed of CGA exclusively, whereas CA was present only in traces in its free form was not present. On the contrary, hydrolysable phenol acids (HPAs) were constituted prevalently from CA, released by CGA alkaline hydrolysis. The stabilization effect on oil oxidation at 110 °C was evaluated as 41% and 118% for RPE and HPAs respectively with respect to the control. At 30 °C, no significant differences were recorded between the two seed extracts. Their antioxidant effect was lower than that at 110 °C and evaluated to be, on average 13%. In comparison with BHA, at 30 °C, both seed extracts were more effective than this synthetic phenol; at 110 °C, the antioxidant effect of RPE and BHA was similar, whereas HPA was significantly more effective than BHA. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the phenols present in sunflower seeds can be considered natural antioxidants suitable for stabilizing the oxidation of cold-pressed sunflower oil, at both low and high temperatures.",1
"Samples of commercially prepared white, whole wheat, flax, and multigrain breads were analyzed by a rapid RP-HPLC method for the presence of the lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). SDG was detected only in products containing flax, with concentrations ranging from 0.06 to 1.98 microM/g of DW (19-602 microM/loaf). Full-fat flax meal, powdered aqueous alcohol extracts of flax seed, and SDG were added to a white bread mix and baked into loaves in a domestic bread maker. Quantitative recovery of SDG from the test breads was observed when SDG was added; however, when flax meal or aqueous alcohol extracts were added, only 73-75% of the theoretical yield of SDG was recovered. SDG was also detected in commercially prepared flax cookies, bagels, and muffins with concentrations ranging from 0.26 to 2.93 microM/g of DW. The extent of grinding of the flax seed was also shown to have a significant effect on the recovery of SDG from both flax meal breads and baked goods, with extraction of SDG from finely ground samples greater than that from course material.",1
"The carpometric characteristics, major antioxidant components, and antioxidant activity of three commercial New Zealand tomato cultivars, Excell, Tradiro, and Flavourine were studied in a greenhouse over a period of 8 months. The variations in the solar radiations received, temperature inside the greenhouse, and changes in the fruit load over the study period significantly (P<0.05) affected the antioxidant components of tomatoes. The total phenolics and antioxidant activity in the three cultivars ranged from 169 to 579mg gallic acid equivalents/100g dry matter (DM) and 1684 to 3340μm TEAC/100g DM, respectively, during the study period. The mean total phenolics and antioxidant activity of the three cultivars was 62% and 39% higher, respectively, in summer (December–February) than in spring (September–November). The ascorbic acid and lycopene content of the three cultivars varied between 165 and 252mg/100g DM and from 19 to 73mg/100g DM, respectively, during the study period. The mean lycopene content of the three cultivars was 31% lower in the summer months than at other times of the study. This study indicates that the antioxidant components of tomatoes can vary considerably with the changes in environmental conditions within the greenhouse and the levels of antioxidants in greenhouse grown tomatoes could be elevated throughout the growing season by modifying the environmental conditions inside the greenhouses.",1
"In hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), vitamin D deficiency has been variably associated with increased complications, primarily graft versus host disease (GvHD), with a potential impact on survival. Results from various studies however, have not been consistent. This analysis was conducted to study the impact of peri-transplant vitamin D levels on transplant outcomes in patients with acute leukemia (AL) who underwent HLA matched (related/unrelated) HSCT. This was a single center retrospective study. Patients of AL including Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Mixed Phenotypic Acute Leukemia (MPAL) who underwent fully matched or 9/10 transplants (related/unrelated) between 2008 and 2019 were included. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 levels ≤20 ng/ml. Those with deficiency received replacement with oral vitamin D at a dose of 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks followed by maintenance with daily vitamin D (800 IU/day). Vitamin D levels were repeated at 4 months from start of replacement. For patients who received correction, repeat levels >20 ng/ml were considered replete. Based on vitamin D levels in the peri-transplant period (within 120 days of transplant), patients were categorised as either vitamin D replete (> 20 ng/ml) or deplete (≤ 20 ng/ml). Peri-transplant vitamin D status was correlated with transplant outcomes. Of the 133 patients included, 31 were deplete (median vitamin D 15.0 ng/ml) and 102 were replete (median vitamin D 34 ng/ml) at time of transplant. Both groups were matched for age, diagnosis, EBMT score and disease risk index (DRI). There were no differences in time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment, CMV reactivation, acute GvHD (aGvHD) or chronic GvHD (cGvHD) between the two groups. Relapse rate, Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were also comparable between the 2 groups. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was high in our patient cohort. Patients who were vitamin D deficient at the time of transplant did not have inferior outcomes, suggesting a limited role of vitamin D in influencing transplant outcomes.",0
"We report on the antileukemic activity of homoharringtonine (HHT) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We showed that HHT inhibited the NOTCH/MYC pathway and induced significantly longer survival in mouse and patient-derived T-ALL xenograft models, supporting HHT as a promising agent for T-ALL.",0
"The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current literature on wearable technologies in oncology patients for the purpose of prognostication, treatment monitoring, and rehabilitation planning. A search was conducted in Medline ALL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science, up until February 2022. Articles were included if they reported on consumer grade and/or non-commercial wearable devices in the setting of either prognostication, treatment monitoring or rehabilitation. We found 199 studies reporting on 18 513 patients suitable for inclusion. One hundred and eleven studies used wearable device data primarily for the purposes of rehabilitation, 68 for treatment monitoring, and 20 for prognostication. The most commonly-reported brands of wearable devices were ActiGraph (71 studies; 36%), Fitbit (37 studies; 19%), Garmin (13 studies; 7%), and ActivPAL (11 studies; 6%). Daily minutes of physical activity were measured in 121 studies (61%), and daily step counts were measured in 93 studies (47%). Adherence was reported in 86 studies, and ranged from 40% to 100%; of these, 63 (74%) reported adherence in excess of 80%. Wearable devices may provide valuable data for the purposes of treatment monitoring, prognostication, and rehabilitation. Future studies should investigate live-time monitoring of collected data, which may facilitate directed interventions.",0
"Intensified pediatric chemotherapy regimens to treat adolescents and young adults (AYA) patients with Philadelphia negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been associated with better outcomes. The local BFM 2009-based scheme complements the risk stratification assessing the measurable residual disease (MRD) along the induction phase with increasing levels of sensitivity. The present retrospective multicenter analysis included 171 AYA (15-40 years) patients treated accordingly between 2013 and 2019. Ninety-one percent obtained morphological complete remission, 67% a negative (<0.1%) MRD at day 33 (TP1), and 78% a negative (<0.01%) MRD at day 78 (TP2). The overall survival (OS) and the event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years were 62%±4.1 and 55%±4.1, respectively. The OS and EFS were significant better for prednisone responders, who achieved <10% BM blast at day 15, a negative MRD at TP1 or at TP2, and for low-risk patients. Age ≤30 years and WBC <30×10",0
"Blackberries are a rich source of polyphenolics, particularly anthocyanins, that may contribute to the reduced risk of chronic disease; however, as with most berries, the fresh fruit are only seasonally available. With most of the blackberries consumed as frozen or in thermally processed forms after long-term storage, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing and 6 months of storage on the anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity of blackberries that were individually quick-frozen (IQF), canned-in-syrup, canned-in-water, pureed, and juiced (clarified and nonclarified). Monomeric anthocyanins, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC FL) and photochemiluminescence (PCL) were determined postprocessing (1 day) and after 1, 3, and 6 months of storage. Processing resulted in increases in polymeric color values (up to 7%) and losses in monomeric anthocyanins (up to 65%). For most products, processing also resulted in losses in antioxidant capacity (by ORAC FL and PCL). Storage at 25 degrees C of all processed products resulted in dramatic losses in monomeric anthocyanins with as much as 75% losses of anthocyanins throughout storage, which coincided with marked increases of percent polymeric color values of these products over 6 months of storage. There were no changes in ORAC FL or PCL for processed products throughout long-term storage. No significant changes in antioxidant capacity or anthocyanin content were observed in IQF fruit during long-term storage at -20 degrees C.",1
"The objective of this study was to describe predictors of loss of ambulation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). This systematic review and meta-analysis included searches of MEDLINE ALL, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2022, for predictors of loss of ambulation in DMD. Search terms included ""Duchenne muscular dystrophy"" as a Medical Subject Heading or free text term, in combination with variations of the term ""predictor"". Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We performed meta-analysis pooling of hazard ratios of the effects of glucocorticoids (vs. no glucocorticoid therapy) by fitting a common-effect inverse-variance model. The bibliographic searches resulted in the inclusion of 45 studies of children and adults with DMD from 17 countries across Europe, Asia, and North America. Glucocorticoid therapy was associated with delayed loss of ambulation (overall meta-analysis HR deflazacort/prednisone/prednisolone: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.40-0.48]) (n = 25 studies). Earlier onset of first signs or symptoms, earlier loss of developmental milestones, lower baseline 6MWT (i.e.,<350 vs. ≥350 metres and <330 vs. ≥330 metres), and lower baseline NSAA were associated with earlier loss of ambulation (n = 5 studies). Deletion of exons 3-7, proximal mutations (upstream intron 44), single exon 45 deletions, and mutations amenable of skipping exon 8, exon 44, and exon 53, were associated with prolonged ambulation; distal mutations (intron 44 and downstream), deletion of exons 49-50, and mutations amenable of skipping exon 45, and exon 51 were associated with earlier loss of ambulation (n = 13 studies). Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CD40 gene rs1883832, LTBP4 gene rs10880, SPP1 gene rs2835709 and rs11730582, and TCTEX1D1 gene rs1060575 (n = 7 studies), as well as race/ethnicity and level of family/patient deprivation (n = 3 studies), were associated with loss of ambulation. Treatment with ataluren (n = 2 studies) and eteplirsen (n = 3 studies) were associated with prolonged ambulation. Magnetic resonance biomarkers (MRI and MRS) were identified as significant predictors of loss of ambulation (n = 6 studies). In total, 33% of studies exhibited some risk of bias. Our synthesis of predictors of loss of ambulation in DMD contributes to the understanding the natural history of disease and informs the design of new trials of novel therapies targeting this heavily burdened patient population.",0
"The composition of phenolic acids in several small berries grown in Northeastern Poland, namely, low-bush blueberries, black mulberries, European juneberries, black currants, fruits of blue-berried honeysuckle, and blackberries, was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The total content of phenolic acids, identified by GC-MS, ranged from 2845.8 +/- 141.0 (black mulberries) to 5418.2 +/- 228.0 (blue-berried honeysuckle). Twenty phenolic acids were identified in the berries. Of these, hydroxycaffeic, m- and p-coumaric, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acids were the major phenolic acids in blackberries and blueberries, m-coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid in blue-berried honeysuckle and black currant fruits, while salicylic, caffeic, and m- and p-coumaric acids were the predominant phenolic acids in European juneberries. Syringic and veratric acids were detected only in blueberries, while p-hydroxybenzoic and sinapic acids were present only in black currants and o-coumaric acid was present in blueberries and black mulberries. The phenolic acids liberated from esters and glycosidic bonds were the major fractions of phenolic acids in the berries.",1
"In the present paper, the following extraction techniques have been used for extracting isoflavonoids from the species Matricaria recutita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, and Agrimonia eupatoria L.: supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized fluid extraction, matrix solid phase dispersion, ultrasonic extraction in an ultrasonic bath (USE) and by means of an ultrasonic homogeniser (HOM), extraction by means of Soxhlet apparatus (SOX), and solid phase extraction. Experimental optimization of all techniques has been carried out using a soybean flour. Subsequent analyses of the extracts were carried out by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The maximum yields of daidzein and genistein were obtained by extraction with the SOX, USE, and HOM techniques. The maximum yields of apigenin and biochanin A from herb samples were obtained by SFE.",1
"CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has shown promise in treating relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), but cytokine release syndrome (CRS) remains a significant side effect. This retrospective cohort study investigated the use of tocilizumab for managing CAR-T-related CRS in 45 R/R B-ALL patients. Of these, 17 patients received tocilizumab, resulting in a significant reduction in the duration of grade 3 CRS compared to those who did not receive the drug. Additionally, 10 patients showed decreased cytokine levels.Importantly, tocilizumab did not impair CAR-T cell expansion or efficacy, nor did it increase the incidence of adverse events. These findings suggest that tocilizumab may be an effective and safe strategy for mitigating CAR-T-related CRS in R/R B-ALL patients, potentially improving patient outcomes and survival.",0
"Recognition of patients with multiple diagnoses, and the unique challenges they pose to clinicians and laboratorians, is increasing rapidly as genome-wide genetic testing grows in prevalence. We describe a unique patient with dual diagnoses of PDCD10-related cerebral cavernous malformations and ETV6-related thrombocytopenia with associated neutropenia. She presented with brain abscesses as an infant, which is highly atypical for these disorders in isolation. Confirming her diagnoses depended on thorough phenotyping both during and after her acute illness. Furthermore, the causative variant in ETV6 is a novel single-exon deletion that required multiple modalities with manual review to confirm, including unique use of polymorphic nucleotides in trio exome data. She illustrates the special challenges of patients with multiple diagnoses, and the multiple tools clinicians and laboratorians must use to treat them.",0
"Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is a rare and heterogeneous type of leukemia known for its poor prognosis. The optimal treatment strategy for this condition currently lacks consensus, leaving uncertainty in its management. Nonetheless, a potential therapeutic option for patients with refractory MPAL who express target antigens is donor-derived chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy. We recently reported a 61-year-old woman with MPAL and elucidated its diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis of MPAL was established based on the classification of World Health Organization in 2016. Despite undergoing 3 different acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens and 1 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) regimen, the patient did not achieve remission. Subsequently, the patient received human CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy. The patient achieved a successful and complete remission after CAR-T cell therapy. Tragically, 8 months after CAR-T infusion, the patient experienced a relapse characterized by CD19-negative disease and ultimately passed away. This case underscores the potential efficacy and safety of human-derived CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in treating refractory MPAL. While this particular patient outcome was unfortunate, it suggests that CAR-T cell therapy may still hold promise as a viable treatment option for MPAL patients unresponsive to other therapies. Further research in this field is warranted to determine the most effective treatment strategies for managing this challenging disease.",0
"The effects of boiling and steaming processes at atmospheric and high pressures on the phenolic components and antioxidant properties of pinto and black beans were investigated. In comparison to the original raw beans, all processing methods caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), condensed tannin content (CTC), monomeric anthocyanin content (MAC), DPPH free-radical scavenging activity (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) values in both pinto and black beans. Steaming processing resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC values than the boiling processes in both pinto and black beans. To further investigate how thermal processing affected phenolic compositions and to elucidate the contribution of individual phenolic compounds to antioxidant properties, phenolic acids, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols were quantitatively analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All thermal processing significantly (p < 0.05) affected individual phenolic acids, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total phenolic acid contents in both pinto and black beans and total flavonol contents in pinto beans, and dramatically reduced anthocyanin contents in black beans. Phenolic acids and flavonols may play important roles on the overall antioxidant activities of pinto beans, while anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols may play important roles on the overall antioxidant activities of black beans.",1
"In precursor B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), leukemic cells harbor genetic abnormalities that play an important role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. A subgroup of BCP-ALL is characterized by the presence of a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and a chimeric BCR::ABL1 gene, whereas in another subgroup, leukemic cells exhibit near-haploidy with chromosome number 24-30. This study presents the third documented case of BCP-ALL in which a near haploid clone concurrently displayed a Ph chromosome/BCR::ABL1. Bone marrow cells obtained at diagnosis from a 25-year-old man with BCP-ALL were genetically investigated using G-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and array comparative genomic hybridization. Leukemic cells had an abnormal karyotype 28<n>,X,-Y,+6,+10,+18,+21,+ der(22) t(9;22)(q34;q11)[13]/28,idem, del(10)(q24),der(12) t(1;12) (q21;p13)[2]/46,XY[3], retained heterozygosity of the disomic chromosomes 6, 10, 18, and 21, had breakpoints in introns 1 of ABL1 and BCR, and carried a BCR::ABL1 chimera encoding the 190 kDa BCR::ABL1 protein. The coexistence of the BCR::ABL1 chimera and near-haploidy in the same cytogenetic clone suggested a possible synergistic role in leukemogenesis, with the former activating signaling pathways and the latter disrupting gene dosage balance.",0
"Five types of caneberries [evergreen blackberries (Rubus laciniatus), marionberries (Rubus ursinus), boysenberries (Rubus ursinus x idaeus), red raspberries (Rubus idaeus), and black raspberries (Rubus occidentalis)] were analyzed for antioxidant activity by measuring their oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). In addition, the berries were analyzed for total phenolics, anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ellagic acid content. All of the berries had high ORAC activity ranging from 24 to 77.2 micromol of Trolox equiv/g of fresh berries. Anthocyanin content ranged from 0.65 to 5.89 mg/g, and phenolics ranged from 4.95 to 9.8 mg/g. Black raspberries had the highest ORAC and anthocyanin and phenolic contents. Only red raspberries had detectable amounts of procyanidin oligomers (monomer, dimers, and trimers). All berries had high levels of ellagic acid (47-90 mg/g), but boysenberries had the highest level prior to hydrolysis. The results from this study indicate that these caneberries were high in antioxidant activity and were rich sources of anthocyanins and phenolics.",1
"The segmentation clock is a molecular oscillator that regulates the timing of somite formation in the developing vertebrate embryo. NOTCH signaling is one of the key pathways required for proper functioning of the segmentation clock. Aberrant NOTCH signaling results in developmental abnormalities such as congenital scoliosis as well as diseases such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL). In this study, we analyzed the effects of a mutation detected in T-ALL patients on somitogenesis using human iPSC-derived PSM cells and somitoids. Mutation of NOTCH1 serine 2513 into alanine compromises the interaction of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) with the F-box protein FBXW7 and consequently increases NICD stability and NICD levels in PSM cells. Moreover, the mutation impairs several aspects of clock gene oscillations such as signal intensity, periodicity, directionality of the oscillations, and the ability to sustain oscillations. Furthermore, it restricts the ability of somitoids to polarize, elongate, and form paired segments. The data suggest a mechanism by which post-translational modification of a key segmentation clock component plays a crucial role in vertebrate axis segmentation.",0
"Antioxidative activity of green and roasted coffee beans and its correlation with the concentrations of certain substances (polyphenols, caffeine, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural) and the roasting method (convection and microwave) was determined. Antioxidative capacity was estimated based on the capability of synthetic free radical (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl, DPPH ?) scavenging and counteracting an oxidation of the model system composed of -carotene and linoleic acid. Green coffee appeared to display the highest effectiveness. In the case of roasted coffee samples, the results of neither test showed distinct correlation; however they indicated that an application of microwave heating for coffee roasting better protected its antioxidative properties. This relationship corresponded to the polyphenol content in roasted beans.",1
"Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) is a haematological malignancy of the lymphoid progenitor cells. Enhanced genetic analyses have led to the identification of over 23 subtypes of B-cell and 17 subtypes of T-cell ALL. In parallel, the development of highly sensitive measurable residual disease assays have refined disease monitoring and risk stratification. Breakthroughs in molecular therapeutics and immunotherapies have improved treatment efficacy while reducing toxicity, challenging the traditional notion of 2·5-3 years of intensive chemotherapy. Notable progress includes the use of more potent BCR::ABL1 tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, and antibodies targeting CD19 and CD22 leukaemia surface antigens, which have delivered unprecedented outcomes in BCR::ABL1-positive ALL. Historically, adults have had poorer outcomes than paediatric cases, largely due to the higher prevalence of adverse genetic subtypes and less favourable genetic subtypes. However, development of new therapies has improved overall survival in B-cell ALL to approximately 80-90%, even in adult and infant populations. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies have also transformed outcomes for children with refractory or relapsed ALL and are now being incorporated into the front-line treatment of adult ALL. These innovations hold the promise of increasing the cure rates while reducing reliance on intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.",0
"Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the bioavailability of flavonoids.",1
"A quality improvement project ('Safe Anaesthesia for ALL-SEAL') was implemented to reduce preventable medication errors and drug wastage in the operating theatre (OT) of a tertiary hospital. The primary objective of this quality improvement project was to prevent the incidence of medication errors, and the secondary objective was to reduce the wastage of unused drugs. A pre-intervention questionnaire and an audit survey were performed, and multidirectional interventions were designed post-survey. A post-intervention survey was conducted to evaluate effectiveness. The incidence of medication errors, including near misses, was assessed for root causes. Unused drugs drawn or diluted in syringes were recorded daily in each OT. The weekly drug orders and mid-week reordering frequency were also monitored. The data were reported as simple means and percentages. Ninety-eight anaesthesia care providers participated in the survey (72.4% doctors and 27.6% anaesthetic nurses). Pre-intervention, 76.1% of respondents had experienced medication errors during their practice. Common errors included misidentification of ampoules or vials (65.2%), miscalculation of dosages (65.2%), improper syringe labelling (56.5%), accidental drug omission (54.3%) and wrong prescriptions (39.1%). The main sources of errors were fatigue/overwork (80.4%) and a hectic OT environment (71.7%). Post-intervention, no incidents of medication errors were reported. In addition, there was a significant reduction in drug wastage. The SEAL project positively prevented medication errors and reduced drug wastage, which should be further validated in other clinical settings.",0
"Anthocyanin pigments from a wide variety of edible and ornamental black, blue, pink, purple, red, and white wheat, barley, corn, rice, and wild rice were identified and quantified to evaluate their potential as natural colorants or functional food ingredients. The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly and exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and black rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as blue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 anthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. The remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of spectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most abundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in blue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and delphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.",1
"Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay as an indicator for potential biological activity.",1
"The presence of antioxidant compounds was studied in fine flours of 5 buckwheat cultivars, Astra and Lileja from Russia, Hruszowska from Poland, Le Harpe from France, and Prego of German native stock, introduced and cultivated in the experimental field of the University of Hohenheim. Spectrophotometric measurements showed that the content of total antioxidants was 14.6, 21.4, 13.8, 16.0, and 11.4 mg/100 g of fine flour in Astra, Hruszowska, Le Harpe, Lileja, and Prego, respectively. Reversed-phase high performance chromatography analyses revealed protocatechuic acid and/or catechin, and resveratrol in Astra; resveratrol, protocatechuic acid and catechin in Hruszowska; resveratrol, protocatechuic acid and/or catechin in Le Harpe; resveratrol and catechin in Lileja and Prego, apart from the most important flavonoid rutin in buckwheat, the amount was 5.6, 3.8, 10.1, 6.3, and 4.9 mg/100 g of flour in Astra, Hruszowska, Le Harpe, Lileja and Prego. It is concluded that all the ethanolic extracts of buckwheat flours were apparently effective to retard free radical induced oxidation, but extracts of Astra and Hruszowska extracts were extremely significant against control, implying the origin of buckwheat cultivar determining the quality as the total antioxidant content was different for each.",1
"Promising results have been reported for adult patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing haploidentical bone marrow transplant (haploBMT) with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). To our knowledge, we report results from the first multicenter trial for pediatric and young adult patients with high-risk acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in the Pediatric Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Consortium. Nine centers performed transplants in 32 patients having acute leukemias or MDS, with myeloablative conditioning (MAC), haploBMT with PTCy, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. The median patient age was 12 years. Diagnoses included AML (15), ALL (11), mixed-lineage leukemia (1), and MDS (5). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 180 days was 0%. The cumulative incidence (CuI) of grade 2 acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) on day 100 was 13%. No patients developed grades 3-4 aGVHD. The CuI of moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) at 1 year was 4%. Donor engraftment occurred in 27 patients (84%). Primary graft failures included 3 patients who received suboptimal bone marrow grafts; all successfully engrafted after second transplants. The CuI of relapse at 1 year was 32%, with more relapse among patients MRD positive pre-BMT vs MRD negative. Overall survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 77% and 73%, and event-free survival rate at 1 and 2 years were 68% and 64%. There was no TRM or severe aGVHD, low cGVHD, and favorable relapse and survival rates. This successful pilot trial has led to a phase 3 trial comparing MAC haploBMT vs HLA-matched unrelated donor BMT in the Children's Oncology Group. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02120157.",0
"Blanching and one year freezer storage were performed on one purple, two white and two green varieties of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. ssp. botrytis) to assess the effects on several health-related phytochemicals. Blanching, prior to freezing, reduced total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates (GLS) by 31% and 37%, respectively. l-ascorbic acid (L-AA), total phenols (TP), anthocyanins, FRAP and ORAC were on average reduced by 19, 15, 38, 16 and 28%, respectively. The colour measured as CIELAB parameters was partly affected by blanching: lightness was significantly reduced in the white cultivars and in a romanesco type cultivar. Chromaticity was reduced in the coloured cultivars with a twice-as-large reduction in the purple cultivars. Hue increased for all samples, except for the purple cultivar where a decrease was found. Long-term freezer storage did not affect total aliphatic and indole GLS in cauliflower in a major way. Freezer storage did result in an average L-AA decrease of 24% for all but the purple cultivar. Some reductions in the TP levels were also found but not to the extent found for L-AA. When an effect was found in the FRAP and ORAC values, the reductions occurred towards the end of the storage period and were 15% and 37%, on average, respectively. Long-term freezer storage did not affect the anthocyanin content and only minor effects were found for the colour parameters.",1
"We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of rats.",1
"The objective of the FLAIR Eurofoods-Enfant Project, funded by the Food-Linked Agro-Industrial Research (FLAIR) Programme of the Commission of the European Communities, Directorate-General XII, is to improve the quality and compatibility of food consumption and food composition data in Europe. One of the activities of the Project was to support the work on nutrient losses and gains factors. At a meeting of the Eurofoods group in Wageningen in 1983, the Nutrient Losses and Gains Project was established and Ms L. Bergström became the project leader. The aim of the project was to collect data related to nutrient losses and gains in the preparation of foods with a view to recommend factors for use with the calculation of the nutrient content of foods and recipes. Since 1983, questionnaires were developed and results analysed, and information on nutrient losses and gains factors and references was compiled. This work resulted in three reports, Nutrient losses and gains in the preparation of foods, Nutrient losses and gains references, and Yields for foods and dishes in Europe, which are combined in this document. The document provides an important step towards the systematic compilation of data on nutrient losses and gains. On behalf of FLAIR Eurofoods-Enfant Project, I would like to extend my thanks to Ms L. Bergström for coordinating the work on nutrient losses and gains and for preparing the final document, and to all persons who have contributed to this work.",1
"There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion (Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.",1
"The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared according to the instructions given on their packaging.",1
"An HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification of sesaminol triglucoside and a sesaminol diglucoside in sesame seeds. These two lignans were isolated, and their structures were characterized by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Defatted sesame flour was extracted first with 85% ethanol for 5 h followed by 70% ethanol for 10 h at room temperature using naringenin as internal standard. Analysis of 65 different samples of sesame seeds indicated that the content of sesaminol triglucoside ranged from 36 to 1560 mg/100 g of seed (mean 637 +/- 312) and that of sesaminol diglucoside ranged from 0 to 493 mg/100 g of seed (mean 75 +/- 95). No significant difference was found between sesaminol glucoside contents in black and white seeds.",1
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a major clinical challenge in hematologic oncology, characterized by a continuous evolution of molecular drivers that shape its heterogeneity across the age spectrum. Pediatric B-ALL is generally associated with high cure rates, while adult forms of the disease are often more aggressive and less responsive to treatment. This review examines the age-specific genetic and epigenetic landscapes that contribute to this disparity, revealing how the nature and timing of molecular alterations point to fundamentally different leukemogenic processes. Favorable genetic aberrations, such as",0
"Antioxidant compounds and the antioxidative activities of new Israeli citrus fruit sweetie [(Oroblanco, pummelo-grapefruit hybrid (Citrus grandis×C. paradisi)] were compared with the better-known white grapefruit. Total and free phenols were determined with the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, phenolic acids (free, esters and glycosides) by HPLC analysis and anthocyanins spectrophotometrically. The antioxidant activities were estimated with two scavenging radicals: 2, 2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate)- (ABTS) and nitric oxide (NO). Free radical scavenging properties of sweetie and grapefruit were evaluated by β-carotene bleaching (β-carotene). The results of kinetic reactions showed that both fruits differed in their capacities to quench these radicals and sweetie showed more antioxidative activity than grapefruit. Trans-hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were more abundant in grapefruits than in sweeties. High correlation was observed between antioxidative activities and phenols (R2=0.94). Both fruits have high concentrations of natural antioxidants with high antioxidative activities. Phenol content and the antioxidative potential are significantly higher in sweetie than in grapefruit. The higher antioxidant capacity of sweetie could make these new kinds of citrus fruits preferable for diets. In summary, the studied citrus fruit has high total phenolics and high antioxidant activities in vitro. Consumption of this fruit may contribute to an adequate intake of antioxidant phytochemicals.",1
"Cure rates for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved markedly in recent decades, in part because of risk stratification incorporating leukemia genomics, response to treatment, and clinical features to be able to determine at diagnosis which patients are more likely to relapse or have refractory disease. Although risk stratification is well developed for patients with B-lineage ALL, it remains challenging for those with T-lineage ALL (T-ALL). Prognostic factors validated across clinical trials and real-world data in T-ALL include age, central nervous system involvement, and measurable residual disease (MRD) response. Immunophenotype, including early T-cell precursor ALL, is widely used to classify T-ALL but is not consistently associated with outcome in multivariable risk models. Historically, few genetic alterations have been consistently associated with outcome, but recent comprehensive, large-scale genomic profiling has identified multiple genetic subtypes and alterations associated with outcome independent of MRD. This review highlights ongoing efforts to identify reliable prognostic biomarkers and underscores the potential of genomics-based classification to guide future T-ALL treatment strategies.",0
"Yellow plums (Prunus domestica L) conventionally and organically grown in the same farm were selected to study the influence of different agronomic practices on antioxidant vitamins (ascorbic acid, vitamin E, beta-carotene) and phenolics (total polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonols) concentration. Conventional plums were grown on tilled soil. Three organic cultivations were performed: tilled soil, soil covered with trifolium, and soil covered with natural meadow. Differences in macronutrients were marginal, whereas antioxidant vitamins and phenolic compounds concentration markedly differed among cultivations. Ascorbic acid, alpha-, gamma-tocopherols, and beta-carotene were higher in organic plums grown on soil covered with natural meadow. The highest phenolic acids content was detected in plums grown on soil covered with trifolium. Total polyphenols content was higher in conventional plums. Quercetin was higher in conventional plums, but myrecitin and kaempferol were higher in organic plums. Under the same cultivar and climate conditions, the type of soil management turned out of primary importance in influencing the concentration of health-promoting compounds.",1
"Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether (P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.",1
"This work was carried out to assess the influence of two extration methods (two-phase centrifugation and pressure) on oil quality from four olive varieties cultivated at Traslasierra Valley, Córdoba, Argentina. Analysis of the effect of the extraction system, on the values of analytical determinations, revealed statistically significant differences in some parameters, mainly in free fatty acid and phenol contents, and K270 values. Oxidative stability showed a significant positive correlation with phenol content. Most of the quality indices and fatty acid compositions showed significant variations among olive varieties. Nevadillo variety had the highest values of oleic acid, whereas Manzanilla was noteworthy for its higher content of phenolic compounds. Accordingly, pressure-extracted oil from the Manzanilla variety presented better oxidative stability.",1
"The aim of the presented work was to study the effect of pressing method, pasteurization, cultivar, and vintage on the content of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and nine procyanidins in grape juice. The results showed that the concentration of these flavan-3-ols in the juice was influenced, in decreasing order of importance, by pressing method, cultivar, pasteurization, and vintage. Cold pressing without maceration was the least and hot pressing after maceration at 60 degrees C for 60 min the most effective method for extracting the flavan-3-ols. Pasteurization increased the concentration of catechins in cold-pressed juices, but it decreased concentrations in hot-pressed juices. The concentration of most procyanidins was increased by pasteurization. Among the white cultivars, Seyval and Niagara were highest in procyanidins and Elvira and Chardonnay were highest in catechins. Vincent, Foch, and Baco were the red cultivars highest in catechins, and Vincent also had the highest content of procyanidins.",1
"Animal and in vitro studies suggest that phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil are effective antioxidants. In animal and in vitro studies, hydroxytyrosol and its metabolites have been shown to be strong antioxidants. One of the prerequisites to assess their in vivo physiologic significance is to determine their presence in human plasma.",1
"To evaluate the efficacy of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in children and explore the prognostic risk factors. The clinical data of 127 newly diagnosed children with T-ALL admitted to five hospitals in Fujian province from April 2011 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed, and compared with children with newly diagnosed acute precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in the same period. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS), and COX proportional hazard regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic factors. Among 116 children with T-ALL who received standard treatment, 78 cases received the Chinese Childhood Leukemia Collaborative Group (CCLG)-ALL 2008 protocol (CCLG-ALL 2008 group), and 38 cases received the China Childhood Cancer Collaborative Group (CCCG)-ALL 2015 protocol (CCCG-ALL 2015 group).

"Studies were made to examine the loss of curcumin, capsaicin and piperine, the active principles of turmeric (Curcuma longa), red pepper (Capsicum annuum) and black pepper (Piper nigrum), respectively, as a result of subjecting the spices to domestic cooking processes. This involved heat treatment of each of these spices by: (i) boiling for 10min, (ii) boiling for 20min and (iii) pressure cooking for 10min. Quantitation of the spice principles in the organic solvent extracts of the freeze-dried cooked spice samples was made with an appropriate HPLC method. Significant loss of spice active principles was observed when the spices were subjected to heat processing. Curcumin loss from heat processing of turmeric was 27–53%, with maximum loss in pressure cooking for 10min. Curcumin loss from turmeric was similar even in the presence of red gram. In the presence of tamarind, the loss of Curcumin from turmeric was 12–30%. Capsaicin losses from red pepper ranged from 18% to 36%, with maximum loss observed in pressure cooking. Presence of either red gram or tamarind or both did not influence the loss of capsaicin. Piperine losses from black pepper ranged from 16% to 34%, with maximum loss observed in pressure cooking. The loss was somewhat lower in the presence of red gram. The results of this investigation indicated diminished availability of spice active principles from cooked foods when the food ingredients have been subjected to either boiling or pressure cooking for few minutes.",1
"Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 (nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 (nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy derived from thymic T-cell precursors. Approximately 40-60% of T-ALL cases exhibit aberrant overexpression of the TAL1 oncogenic transcription factor. Here, we provide a comprehensive view of the TAL1-induced transcriptional program in human T-ALL cells using a rapid protein degradation system coupled with integrative approaches. Our study demonstrates that TAL1 targets can be classified into several groups, each of which exhibits unique gene expression kinetics, chromatin features, and regulatory mechanisms. Group A genes are highly dependent on TAL1, many of which are not expressed in normal T cells or TAL1-negative T-ALL cells, representing an oncogenic TAL1 signature. The TAL1 complex predominantly activates group A genes. TAL1's effect is not replaceable with its regulatory partners GATA3 or RUNX1. In contrast, group B genes, many of which are generally expressed across different T-ALL subgroups, exhibit densely-connected chromatin-chromatin interactions and demonstrate the collaborative roles played by TAL1 with other transcription factors. Interestingly, TAL1 cooperates with NOTCH1 to regulate gene expression in TAL1-positive T-ALL cells, whereas it potentially antagonizes the NOTCH1-MYC pathway and leads to lethality in TAL1-negative/ TLX3-positive cells, demonstrating the context-dependent roles of TAL1.",0
"Six pecan cultivars were analyzed for their antioxidant capacity (AC), total phenolics (TP), condensed tannin (CT), HPLC phenolic profile, tocopherol and fatty acid composition. Kernels which included the outer brown testa or pellicle, and shells which is the hard cover that surrounds the kernel, were evaluated for each cultivar. Strong correlations were found in kernels between AC and TP for both DPPH (r2 = 0.98) and ACORAC (r2 = 0.75) antioxidant assays. ACORAC values ranged from 372 to 817 μmol trolox equivalents/g defatted kernel, corresponding to Desirable and Kanza cultivars, respectively. CT ranged from 23 to 47 mg catechin equivalents/g defatted kernel and TP from 62 to 106 mg of chlorogenic acid equivalents/g defatted kernel. After a consecutive basic-acid hydrolysis, gallic acid, ellagic acid, catechin and epicatechin were identified by HPLC. The TP, AC and CT were 6, 4.5 and 18 times higher, respectively, for shells compared to kernels. The presence of phenolic compounds with high antioxidant capacity in kernels and shells indicates pecans can be considered an important dietary source of antioxidants.",1
"In pro-B cells, VDJ recombination at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is impaired. B cell progenitor recombination implies the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by the RAG recombinase, which are subsequently repaired by specific mechanisms. We cultured primary murine pro-B cells with IL-7 to evaluate H2AX histone phosphorylation, a well-established marker of DSB formation (γ-H2AX foci) and the expression of proteins involved in DNA repair. Our results indicated that IL-7 upregulated the expression of several molecules involved in homologous recombination, the most accurate DSB repair mechanism. Quantitative analyses of γ-H2AX foci revealed that IL-7 significantly increased DSB formation in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, γ-H2AX expression was altered in RAG2-deficient pro-B cells and absent in RAG1-deficient pro-B cells treated with IL-7, demonstrating the requirement of both RAG1 and RAG2 recombinase subunits. CD43 expression inversely correlates with the degree of cell differentiation and its level is often evaluated to assess the B lymphoid developmental stage. We observed that IL-7 upregulated CD43 expression and the percentage of large CD43/γ-H2AX double-positive cells, suggesting an effect on less differentiated, immature cells. Notably, we also found that IL-7 increased radiation-induced DSBs, while simultaneously supporting cell survival. This study uncovers novel effects of IL-7 on B cell differentiation, DSB formation, and DNA repair. It is well established that IL-7 promotes the proliferation and survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Our data suggest that drugs targeting IL-7 could improve ALL therapeutic protocols.",0
"Working groups of the European LeukemiaNet have published several important consensus guidelines. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has many different clinical and biological subgroups and the knowledge on disease biology and therapeutic options is increasing exponentially. The European Working Group for Adult ALL has therefore summarized the current state of the art and provided comprehensive consensus recommendations for diagnostic approaches, biologic and clinical characterization, prognostic factors, and risk stratification as well as definitions of endpoints and outcomes. Aspects of treatment, management of subgroups and specific situations, aftercare, and supportive care are covered in a separate publication. The present recommendation intends to provide guidance for the initial management of adult patients with ALL and to define principles as a basis for future collaborative research.",0
"Flavonoid, ascorbic acid and total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of “jalapeño” (Veracruz, Mitla, Tam Mild, Jaloro, Sweet Jalapeño), “yellow wax” [(Hungarian Yellow, Long Hot Yellow, Gold Spike (hybrid)], “Chile” (New Mexico-6, Green Chile), “ancho” (San Luis Ancho), and “serrano” (Hidalgo) peppers were investigated at green or yellow stages of maturity. Major pepper flavonoids were quercetin and luteolin which were present in conjugate forms. Total flavonoid content varied from none detectable to 800 mg/kg after hydrolysis. “Chile”, “yellow wax” and “ancho” peppers had greater flavonoid and ascorbic acid contents and antioxidant activities than “jalapeño” peppers. Sep-Pak C18(tm) bound phenolic compounds, including flavonoids, correlated well with antioxidant activity (r2=0.86). Luteolin had highest antioxidant activity followed by capsaicin and quercetin on equimolar basis.",1
"Targeted immunotherapy for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive tumor of developing T cell progenitors, is an urgent unmet need, especially for relapsed/refractory disease. Selective T-ALL targeting is challenging due to the shared antigen expression between leukemic and normal T cells. Here we identify the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR), a surface receptor essential for T cell development, as a biomarker of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in human T-ALL. Loss-of-function genetic approaches demonstrate that pre-TCR signaling is necessary for LIC activity and tumor progression in pre-TCR",0
"T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) is an aggressive form of hematological malignancy associated with poor prognosis in adult patients. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are aberrantly expressed in T-LBL/ALL and are considered potential therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated the antitumor effect of a novel HDAC inhibitor, chidamide, on T-LBL/ALL. HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 levels in T-LBL/ALL cell lines and patient samples were compared with those in normal controls. Flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and lactate dehydrogenase release assays were conducted in Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells to assess apoptosis and pyroptosis. A specific forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) inhibitor was used to rescue pyroptosis and upregulated gasdermin E (GSDME) expression caused by chidamide treatment. The role of the FOXO1 transcription factor was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The efficacy of chidamide in vivo was evaluated in a xenograft mouse. The expression of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 was significantly upregulated in T-LBL/ALL. Cell viability was obviously inhibited after chidamide treatment. Pyroptosis, characterized by cell swelling, pore formation on the plasma membrane and lactate dehydrogenase leakage, was identified as a new mechanism of chidamide treatment. Chidamide triggered pyroptosis through caspase 3 activation and GSDME transcriptional upregulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that chidamide led to the increased transcription of GSDME through a more relaxed chromatin structure at the promoter and the upregulation of FOXO1 expression. Moreover, we identified the therapeutic effect of chidamide in vivo . This study suggested that chidamide exerts an antitumor effect on T-LBL/ALL and promotes a more inflammatory form of cell death via the FOXO1/GSDME axis, which provides a novel choice of targeted therapy for patients with T-LBL/ALL.",0
"The influence of genetic ancestry on genomics in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) has not been fully explored. We examined the impact of genetic ancestry on multiomic alterations, survival outcomes, and risk stratification. Among 1,309 children and young adults with T-ALL treated on the Children's Oncology Group trial AALL0434, the prognostic value of five commonly altered T-ALL genes varied by ancestry-including NOTCH1, which was associated with superior overall survival for patients of European ancestry but was nonprognostic among patients of African ancestry. Integrating genetic ancestry with published T-ALL risk classifiers, we identified that an X01 penalized Cox regression classifier stratified patients regardless of ancestry, whereas a European multigene classifier misclassified patients of certain ancestries. Overall, 80% of patients harbored a genomic alteration in at least one gene with differential prognostic impact in an ancestry-specific manner. These data demonstrate the importance of incorporating genetic ancestry into genomic risk classification. There is a lack of studies examining the prognostic significance of genomic features by genetic ancestry in T-ALL, especially in non-European ancestral groups. In this study, we demonstrate how the prognostic value of individual alterations differs by genetic ancestry, warranting future studies to identify germline alleles affecting these associations.

A novel high-performance liquid chromatography with chemiluminescence detection has been developed for the determination of trans-resveratrol in red wines based on the enhancement by trans-resveratrol of the chemiluminescence from luminol–potassium ferricyanide system in alkaline medium. Samples were separated on a C8 column using isocratic elution of methanol/water (35:65). Quantification of trans-resveratrol in Chinese red wines was performed without any sample pretreatment. It allows for the determination of trans-resveratrol in the range 0.5–750 μg/L with a detection limit of 0.166 μg/L (S/N=3). The relative standard deviation (RSD) is 1.16% for 7.5 μg/L trans-resveratrol (n=11). trans-Resveratrol was detected in Chinese red wines with the recoveries of 92.2–114.7%. Concentrations ranged from 0.072 to 1.607 mg/L in Chinese red wines.,1
"The application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and targeted immunotherapy has revolutionized the therapeutic strategies and clinical outcome for BCR::ABL1-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCR::ABL1(+) B-ALL). The classification was updated successively by the World Health Organization and the International Consensus Classification in 2022. The risk stratification of this entity, for the first time, was modified by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in 2023, both minimal residual disease assessment and IKZF1(plus) genotyping recognized as critical prognostic factors. These important updates would have significant implications for clinical management. Therefore, this review focused on the latest advances in the classification and prognostic evaluation of BCR::ABL1(+) B-ALL. 酪氨酸激酶抑制剂和免疫靶向药物的应用已经明显改变了BCR::ABL1阳性急性B淋巴细胞白血病的治疗策略和临床结果。2022年，世界卫生组织（WHO）和国际共识分型（ICC）相继对该疾病的分型进行了更新。2023年，美国国立综合癌症网络（NCCN）也首次更新了该疾病的预后分层，其治疗后的微小残留病评估和IKZF1(plus)基因分型是最关键的预后因素。以上更新将对临床诊疗产生重大影响，本文聚焦于该疾病分型和预后评估的最新更新内容展开综述。.",0
"This study evaluated the impact of different levels of pretransplantation minimal residual disease (pre-MRD) on the prognosis of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). A retrospective study from January 2014 to April 2025 including 104 pediatric patients with ALL was performed. MRD was determined using multiparametric flow cytometry. Compared to patients with pre-MRD positive, patients with pre-MRD negative had better event-free survival (EFS) rate (33.3% vs. 64.0%, P = .006) and lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rate (46.7% vs. 28.1%, P = .028). In the subgroup whose MRD turned negative before transplantation, the number of times of MRD negativity (1 time vs. ≥2 times) had no significant effect on the long-term survival rate and the recurrence rate of leukemia after transplantation (P > .05). We found that among patients in the study, those with MRD≥1.0 × 10 Patients with positive pre-MRD experienced a significant decrease in survival after transplantation. For children with leukemia whose MRD turned negative before transplantation, it is not necessary to consolidate chemotherapy again, and it may be possible to bridge transplantation as soon as possible to treat the leukemia.",0
"Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference Material.",1
"The purpose of this study was to investigate the comparative clarification techniques in apple juice processing and their effects on the patulin content and some other quality parameters including phenolic compounds and organic acids. The clarification techniques varied significantly in their effects for the removal of patulin from apple juice. Conventional clarification using gelatin, bentonite, and activated charcoal was found to be more effective than others. However, this technique also caused a significant decrease in apple juice phenolics adversely affecting the juice authenticity. Adsorbent resin treatment just after ultrafiltration also resulted in a remarkable decrease in patulin and brought an improvement in juice color and clarity. PVPP itself had no observable effect on patulin, but specifically adsorbed apple juice phenolics. Organic acid compositions of the samples were not significantly affected from the clarification techniques applied in this study.",1
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are single-stranded RNAs that have received much attention in recent years. CircRNAs lack a 5' head and a 3' poly-A tail. The structure of this type of RNAs make them resistant to digestion by exonucleases. CircRNAs are expressed in different cells and have various functions. The function of circRNAs is done by sponging miRNAs, changing gene expression, and protein production. The expression of circRNAs changes in different types of cancers, which causes changes in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Changes in the expression of circRNAs can cause the invasion and progression of tumors. Studies have shown that changes in the expression of circRNAs can be seen in acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). The conducted studies aim to identify circRNAs whose expression has changed in these leukemias and their more precise function so that these circRNAs can be identified as biomarkers, prediction of patient prognosis, and treatment targets for ALL and CLL patients. In this study, we review the studies conducted on the role and function of circRNAs in ALL and CLL patients. The results of the studies show that there is a possibility of using circRNAs as biomarkers in the identification and treatment of patients in the future.",0
"Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic agents in pac choi.",1
In patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-ALL/B-NHL) with low CD3 We retrospectively collected data on LVL (≥3-fold TBV) and NVL (<3-fold TBV) performed for patients with r/r B-ALL/B-NHL in our institution during November 2019 and September 2023. All procedures were performed using a continuous mononuclear cell collection (cMNC) protocol with the Spectra Optia. Although pre-apheresis CD3 LVL procedures using Spectra Optia cMNC protocol was well tolerated and did not affect the manufacturing of tisa-cel.,0
"The chlorogenic acid and the total polyphenol content were analysed in two different potato varieties (Kennebec, Agria) grown under five different nitrogen fertiliser rates (0, 75, 150, 225, 300 kg ha-1). Chlorogenic acid content ranged between 6.0-22.3 mg kg-1 fresh weight and was not influenced by fertiliser levels. The chlorogenic acid in potato tubers accounted for almost 90% of the total polyphenols. Free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities of the tubers were also analysed. Ethanolic extracts if the tubers showed marked hydrogen-donating activity in the experiment using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), they had reducing power as measured by the Fe(III)?Fe(II) reaction, but did not exhibit H2O2 scavenging activity assessed with a chemiluminescence method. Potato extracts showed significant, although weak Cu(II)-chelating activity and inhibited the autoxidation of linolenic acid as measured by the thiocyanate method. Chlorogenic acid containing extract of potato, can act as primary and secondary antioxidant in prevention of oxidative stress. The strong correlation between the antioxidant activity and the level of total pholyphenols suggests that the phenolic compounds are important antioxidant components of whole potato tubers. Variety had minimal, while nitrogen fertiliser rate had no effects on the levels of the studied characteristics.",1
"Studies on dasatinib-based low-intensity induction regimens and post-remission strategies are limited in China. Therefore, we conducted a single-center phase 2 trial in newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to establish the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach. Patients received one month of dasatinib plus low-intensity chemotherapy and two months of dasatinib monotherapy for induction, followed by a single course of high-dose methotrexate for consolidation. Subsequently, they underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) or tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based treatment for maintenance therapy between October 2015 and August 2022. Twenty-two patients were enrolled. Median age was 45 years (range, 20-71). The rates of major and complete molecular responses in the third month were 18.2% and 40.9% respectively. With a median follow-up of 15 months (range, 5-89), the estimated 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 52.4% and 73.2%, respectively. The TKI-based cohort had a significantly poorer DFS ( Our results suggest that dasatinib-based low-intensity chemotherapy is safe and effective as an induction strategy in the Chinese population. Allo-HSCT plays a crucial role in the long-term outcomes of patients with Ph+ ALL. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02690922.",0
"Bone marrow transplantation is an expensive treatment procedure that result in financial burdens. The aim of this study was to assess the financial burdens of this procedure from the caregiver's viewpoint. This cross-sectional study included pediatric patients (under 18 years old) who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation March 21, 2017, and March 21, 2019. A checklist was designed for interview and data collection. A comprehensive review of articles in PubMed, Embase and web of science and scientific texts was conducted. The checklist comprises 25 items, of which 11 pertain to the demographic characteristics of the patient's guardian, three items are dedicated to the child's medical condition, and remaining items focus on the financial implications of the transplant, such as its impact on employment and bank savings, selling or exchanging assets to cover costs, receiving charitable support, economizing on essential and non-essential expenses, borrowing money to cover transplant expenses, and downgrading one's standard of living to afford the transplant. A total of 257 caregivers of pediatric patients who were underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were interviewed. The majority of respondents (92%) were parents of patients. The predominant type of HCT among patients was allogeneic (82.9%). Patients underwent HCT for 17 different diseases, with the most common being thalassemia (18.7%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (16.7%). About 18% of the respondents stated that they had to take leave from work to pursue transplantation for their patients. Additionally, 19.5% of the participants reported that they had to work part-time due to the demands of the treatment process, while about 18% were completely unemployed in order to follow the treatment process of their patients. 92% of caregivers were forced to spend all of their bank savings to cover HCT expenses. Furthermore, 67% of respondents stated that they were forced to sell their assets to cover HCT expenses, with gold and jewelry being the most commonly sold assets by households (38.5% or 99 people). Despite the lower cost of bone marrow transplantation in Iran compared to developed countries, the purchasing power of people and the insurance coverage should be taken into account. This study revealed that the financial burden on Iranian caregivers is substantial and leads to severe economic impacts and deterioration of households' quality of life. Therefore, policy and insurance reforms are needed to improve the situation of bone marrow transplantations.",0
"The aglycone, or free quercetin, and total quercetin content of 75 cultivars and selections was analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Quercetin glycosides were hydrolyzed into aglycones. Total quercetin content in yellow, pink, and red onions varied from 54 to 286 mg·kg-1 fresh weight in different onion entries grown during 1992. White onions contained trace amounts of total quercetin. Free quercetin content in all the onions was low (< 0.4 mg·kg-1) except in ‘20272-G’ (12.5 mg·kg-1 fresh weight). Bulbs stored at 5, 24, and 30C and controlled atmosphere (CA) for 0,1,2,3,4, and 5 months showed a most marked change in total quercetin content at 24C compared to other treatments, with a rise in mid-storage followed by a drop. Storage at 5 and 30C also demonstrated a similar change. However, total quercetin content did not vary significantly in bulbs stored at CA for 5 months. We conclude that genetic and storage factors affect quercetin content on onions.",1
Punicalagin is an antioxidant ellagitannin of pomegranate juice. This compound is responsible for the high antioxidant activity of this juice.

The present work aims to evaluate the bioavailability and metabolism of punicalagin in the rat as an animal model.,1
"Immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) over the past 2 decades with excellent outcomes in both adults and children particularly in the relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease setting where in general the treatment outcomes are dismal. Several immune therapies including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific T cell engagers, antibody-drug conjugates, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cells have shown excellent outcomes and safety in this setting. Based on the observed high response rates and improved survival outcomes in patients with R/R ALL, immunotherapy is now being prospectively studied in the upfront setting with an aim to reduce treatment related toxicity and death with conventional chemotherapy. In this manuscript we discuss the various clinical trials that have shown excellent outcomes in the frontline setting and discuss how best to incorporate them in newly diagnosed, treatment naïve ALL patients either as monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic agents.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a malignant proliferation of T-cell progenitors originating in the thymus. T-ALL is a heterogenous disease involving the dysregulation of various oncogenes/tumour suppressor (TS) genes. Loss of the TS gene PTEN, is a recurrent alteration, which is often associated to mature T-ALL sub-group expressing a T-cell receptor (TCR). Herein, we used single-cell RNA sequencing approach to investigate the impact of the absence of PTEN on pathological development of mouse thymocytes. First, our differential gene expression analysis of tumour cells versus physiologic cells uncovers an ectopic expression, in leukemic cells, of the gene encoding Bex1. Then, to determine the relevance of our observation in Human, we queried public RNAseq database from the TARGET-TCGA project. We show that BEX1, BEX2 and BEX5 genes are ectopically expressed in T-ALL samples and we further found that ectopic BEX expression is mainly restricted to the T-ALL subgroup over-expressing TAL1 oncogene. Proximity ligation assays demonstrated the nuclear colocalization of BEX1/2 proteins with TAL1 in T-ALL cells. To investigate their functional role, we generated Jurkat cells with a triple knockout of BEX1, BEX2, and BEX5 using CRISPR-Cas9. This genetic inactivation led to reduced cell proliferation, a loss of H3K4me1 marks notably at genomic regions enriched for E-box motifs, and dysregulation of several TAL1 target genes. Collectively, our findings suggest that BEX1 and BEX2 may contribute to human T-ALL oncogenesis by acting as cofactors within the TAL1 complex.",0
"Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential end uses.",1
"BACKGROUND: The effect of high-intensity pulsed electric field (HIPEF) processing (35 kV cm−1 for 1500 µs using 6-µs bipolar pulses at 200 Hz) on the antioxidant features (vitamin C, β-carotene, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity) of carrot juice as well as on peroxidase activity was investigated and compared to the observed in heat pasteurised juices (90 °C for 60 s or 30 s) having the fresh juice as a reference. RESULTS: HIPEF and heat-treated carrot juices had higher β-carotene and lower vitamin C contents than the untreated juices immediately after processing. The antioxidant capacity of the juices was significantly modified neither by HIPEF nor by thermal treatments. POD activity decreased drastically (≥93.3%) after processing irrespective of the treatment applied. Vitamin C and β-carotene content decreased throughout the storage following an exponential trend (R2 = 0.801–0.984) with degradation rates between 1.7 × 10−2 and 3.5 × 10−2 day−1. Vitamin C and β-carotene contents were better maintained in HIPEF-treated than in heat-pasteurised juices throughout the storage. Total phenolic content and the antioxidant capacity of the HIPEF-treated juice did not substantially differ from that of the thermally treated juice for 56 days. CONCLUSION: HIPEF processing may help to achieve fresh-like carrot juices with increased amounts of health-related phytochemicals",1
Combined anterior cruciate ligament and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ACL+ALL r) is a common procedure to treat rotational instability and to prevent ACL graft failure. Recent studies have described numerous combined reconstruction techniques to obtain the most anatomical procedure with the least graft donor site morbidity and the best clinical results. Hamstring (HG) grafts are the most popular graft in literature. Leaving pedicle HG can preserve enough blood supply to improve tendon-bone healing with additional mechanical fixation of the graft on the tibial side. A single femoral tunnel reduces bone loss and prevents convergence of 2 femoral tunnels. We describe an original ACL and ALL reconstruction technique that preserves hamstring tibial insertion with a single blind femoral tunnel.,0
"The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green and ripe fruit were detected.",1

"Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.",1
"The health effects of dietary polyphenols might be explained by both intact compounds and their metabolites formed either in the tissues or in the colon by the microflora. The quantitative importance and biological activities of the microbial metabolites have seldom been examined in vivo. We measured the microbial metabolites formed in four groups of rats (n = 8) fed for 8 d a diet supplemented with 0.12 g/100 g catechin, 0.25 or 0.50 g/100 g red wine powder containing proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids, flavanols, anthocyanins and flavonols or an unsupplemented diet. Fourteen aromatic acid metabolites were assayed in urine collected for 24 h by an HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS)-MS method. The three main metabolites formed from the catechin diet were 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid. Their total urinary excretion accounted for 4.7 g/100 g of the catechin ingested and that of intact catechins for 45.3 g/100 g. For wine polyphenols, the same microbial metabolites as observed for the catechin diet were identified in urine along with hippuric, p-coumaric, vanillic, 4-hydroxybenzoic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids. All together, these aromatic acids accounted for 9.2 g/100 g of the total wine polyphenols ingested and intact catechins for only 1.2 g/100 g. The higher excretion of aromatic acids by rats fed wine polyphenols is likely due to their poor absorption in the proximal part of the gut. Some of the microbial metabolites still bear a reducing phenolic group and should also prevent oxidative stress in inner tissues. More attention should be given in the future to these microbial metabolites and their biological properties to help explain the health effects of polyphenols that are not easily absorbed through the gut barrier.",1
"A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with in-line connected diode-array (DAD) and electro-array (EC) detection to identify and quantify 17 flavonoids in plant-derived foods is described. Catechins were extracted from the samples using ethyl acetate, and quantification of these compounds was performed with the EC detector. Other flavonoids were quantified with DAD after acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the determination of catechins and other flavonoids in plant-derived foods. Responses of the detection systems were linear within the range evaluated, 20-200 ng/injection (DAD) and 20-100 ng/injection (EC), with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.999. Coefficient of variation was under 10.5%, and recoveries of flavonoids ranged from 70 to 124%. Purity of the flavonoid peaks was confirmed by combining the spectral and voltammetric data.",1
"Effects of microwave and conventional cooking methods were studied on total phenolics and antioxidant activity of pepper, squash, green beans, peas, leek, broccoli and spinach. Total phenolics content of fresh vegetables ranged from 183.2 to 1344.7mg/100g (as gallic acid equivalent) on dry weight basis. Total antioxidant activity ranged from 12.2% to 78.2%. With the exception of spinach, cooking affected total phenolics content significantly (p<0.05). The effect of various cooking methods on total phenolics was significant (p<0.05) only for pepper, peas and broccoli. After cooking, total antioxidant activity increased or remained unchanged depending on the type of vegetable but not type of cooking.",1
"High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and mass spectrometric (MS) procedures were developed to determine lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) and chaparral (Larrea tridentata). Flaxseed contains high levels of phytoestrogens. Chaparral has been associated with acute nonviral toxic hepatitis and contains lignans that are structurally similar to known estrogenic compounds. Both flaxseed and chaparral products have been marketed as dietary supplements. A mild enzyme hydrolysis procedure to prevent the formation of artifacts in the isolation step was used in the determination of secoisolariciresinol in flaxseed products. HPLC with ultraviolet spectral (UV) or MS detection was used as the determinative steps. HPLC procedures with UV detection and mass spectrometry were developed to characterize the phenolic components, including lignans and flavonoids, of chaparral and to direct fractionation studies for the bioassays.",1
"A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.",1
"Type I interferons (IFN-Is), secreted by hematopoietic cells, drive immune surveillance of solid tumors. However, the mechanisms of suppression of IFN-I-driven immune responses in hematopoietic malignancies including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are unknown. Using high-dimensional cytometry, we delineate the defects in IFN-I production and IFN-I-driven immune responses in high-grade primary human and mouse B-ALLs. We develop natural killer (NK) cells as therapies to counter the intrinsic suppression of IFN-I production in B-ALL. We find that high expression of IFN-I signaling genes predicts favorable clinical outcome in patients with B-ALL, underscoring the importance of the IFN-I pathway in this malignancy. We show that human and mouse B-ALL microenvironments harbor an intrinsic defect in paracrine (plasmacytoid dendritic cell) and/or autocrine (B-cell) IFN-I production and IFN-I-driven immune responses. Reduced IFN-I production is sufficient for suppressing the immune system and promoting leukemia development in mice prone to MYC-driven B-ALL. Among anti-leukemia immune subsets, suppression of IFN-I production most markedly lowers the transcription of IL-15 and reduces NK-cell number and effector maturation in B-ALL microenvironments. Adoptive transfer of healthy NK cells significantly prolongs survival of overt ALL-bearing transgenic mice. Administration of IFN-Is to B-ALL-prone mice reduces leukemia progression and increases the frequencies of total NK and NK-cell effectors in circulation. Ex vivo treatment of malignant and non-malignant immune cells in primary mouse B-ALL microenvironments with IFN-Is fully restores proximal IFN-I signaling and partially restores IL-15 production. In B-ALL patients, the suppression of IL-15 is the most severe in difficult-to-treat subtypes with MYC overexpression. MYC overexpression promotes sensitivity of B-ALL to NK cell-mediated killing. To counter the suppressed IFN-I-induced IL-15 production in MYC We find that restoration of the intrinsically suppressed IFN-I production in B-ALL underlies the therapeutic efficacy of IL-15-producing NK cells and that such NK cells represent an attractive therapeutic solution for the problem of drugging MYC in high-grade B-ALL.",0
"Assessing antioxidant intake requires a food antioxidant database. However, cooking may affect antioxidant content due to antioxidant release, destruction or creation of redox-active metabolites. Here, effects of boiling, steaming and microwaving of broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and choy-sum (Chinese cabbage) were explored by measuring antioxidant contents of raw and cooked vegetables. Cooking water was also tested. For all cooked vegetables, antioxidant content was highest in steamed>boiled>microwaved, and decreased with longer cooking time, regardless of method. All steamed vegetables had higher antioxidant contents than had matching raw vegetables. Effects were variable for boiling and microwaving. Microwaving caused greater antioxidant loss into cooking water than did boiling. Marked losses of anitoxidants occurred in microwaved cabbage and spinach. To assess food antioxidant content/intake accurately, cooking effects need detailed study. Steaming may be the cooking method of choice to release/conserve antioxidants. The cooking water is a potentially rich source of dietary antioxidants.",1
"Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between the intake of polyphenol-rich foods and the urinary excretion of several phenolic compounds and therefore explore whether these phenolic compounds could be used as a biomarker of intake. Fifty-three participants of the SU.VI.MAX study (a randomised primary-prevention trial evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) collected a 24 h urine and a spot urine sample and filled a dietary record during a 2 d period. Thirteen polyphenols and metabolites, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid, gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin, phloretin, enterolactone and enterodiol, were measured using HPLC-electrospray ionisation-MS-MS. In spot samples apple consumption was positively correlated to phloretin, grapefruit consumption to naringenin, orange to hesperetin, citrus fruit consumption to both naringenin and hesperetin, with r coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.57 (P < 0.05). The combination of fruits and/or fruit juices was positively correlated to gallic acid and 4-O-methylgallic acid, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin and phloretin (r 0.24-0.44, P < 0.05). Coffee consumption was positively correlated to caffeic and chlorogenic acids (r 0.29 and 0.63, P < 0.05 respectively). Black tea and wine consumption were positively correlated with gallic and 4-O-methylgallic acids (r 0.37-0.54, P < 0.001). The present results suggest that several polyphenols measured in a spot urine sample can be used as biomarkers of polyphenol-rich food intake.",1
"This study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant properties, including phenolics, ascorbic acid and carotenoids of four green asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) spears cultivars (UC 157, AM 822, Gijnlim, and Grande) grown under greenhouse conditions and to asses their changes during cooking process. The highest spear production of category ‘extra’ and ‘first’ was recorded on ‘UC 157’, whereas the higher production of “second” class spears was recorded on ‘UC 157’ and ‘Gijnlim’. The Grande cultivar has provided a higher total phenol, quercetin, rutin and lutein + zeaxantin contents in comparison to ‘UC 157’, ‘Gjinlim’ and ‘AM 822’ cultivars. The results also indicate that the effect of cooking process was significant and more pronounced than the effect of cultivars. The cooking process increased the antioxidant activity, total phenols, quercetin, rutin, β-carotene and lutein + zeaxantin contents by, 16%, 23%, 98%, 32%, 24% and 25%, respectively, but decreased the total ascorbic acid content by 52%.",1
"The treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has undoubtedly transitioned into the immunotherapy era. We conducted a retrospective study on B-ALL immunotherapy, especially regimens including blinatumomab (Blina) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), at our center. A total of 21 B-ALL patients were involved in this study, including 18 with newly diagnosed (ND) B-ALL and 3 with relapsed B-ALL. RNA sequencing identified a total of five new fusions (ADD1::JAK2, PVT1::IGLL5, PAX5::KANK2, ETV6::BCL2L14, and CDKN2A::TGFBR3) in five different patients. All ND patients can be divided into four groups according to treatment response. Group 1, which included patients with PAX5::KANK2 and CREBBP::ZNF384, responded best to Blina. Group 2, which included one patient with CDKN2A::TGFBR3 fusion and one who was BCR::ABL positive, showed an inferior response to Blina compared with Group 1. Group 3 initially showed no response but subsequently responded very favorably to InO and showed further improvement with Blina. Group 4, which included patients with PVT1::IGLL5 fusion, had the poorest prognosis. In conclusion, Blina and InO showed specific treatment advantages for different patient groups in our cohort that may be attributed to intrinsic genetic characteristics, such as new fusion genes.",0
"Recent studies have shown that the mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) are biotransformed in vitro by hepatic microsomes from rats and humans to various metabolites carrying one additional hydroxy group either at the aromatic or at the aliphatic moiety. To clarify whether these metabolites are also formed in vivo, each lignan was administered intraduodenally at a dose of 10 mg/kg of bw to bile duct-catheterized female Wistar rats and the 6 h bile analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. With END-dosed rats, three products of aromatic and two of aliphatic monohydroxylation were found, whereas six aromatic and five aliphatic monohydroxylated biliary metabolites were detected after administration of ENL. The metabolites hydroxylated at the aromatic rings were unequivocally identified by comparison with synthetic reference compounds. The structures of the in vivo metabolites arising from aliphatic hydroxylation could not be completely elucidated; they were identical with some of the formerly reported microsomal products according to GC retention times and mass spectra. Significant amounts of most of the metabolites of the mammalian lignans identified in bile were also found in the urine of female rats after oral administration of 10 mg/kg of bw END or ENL and in the urine of female and male Wistar rats after they had been fed a diet containing 5% flaxseed. Thus, the mammalian lignans END and ENL give rise to several hydroxylated metabolites in vivo, which may contribute to the biological effects of these important food constituents.",1
"Phenolics have been identified and quantified in nine varieties of barley and their corresponding malts as flavan-3-ols, flavonols, phenolic acids and apolar esters. Flavan-3-ols are monomers, (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin, and polymers constituted mainly by units of (+)-catechin and (+)-gallocatechin. The most abundant compounds were the dimers procyanidin B3 and prodelphinidin B3. The main trimeric procyanidin was procyanidin C2. After malting, the phenolic content decreased for all varieties. Catechin monomers were the most affected. Beside polyphenols, barley and malt extracts contained other antioxidants: carotenoids (lutein and zeaxanthin) and tocopherols (α, δ and γ). The antioxidant activity was measured using three methods: capacity to react with DPPH. (ARP), inhibition of lipoxygenase activity (LoxI) and inhibition of cooxidation of β-carotene in a linoleate model system (AOP). The inhibition of cooxidation of β-carotene in a linoleate model system did not allow varieties to be discriminated. They all have high antioxidative properties. Using this assay, tocopherols were the best antioxidants. The ARP (antiradical power) was correlated positively with the amount of total flavan-3-ols (r = 0.89) and increased with the degree of polymerisation. The LoxI assay allowed discrimination of the nine varieties of barley and their corresponding malts but was not correlated with any compound, although flavan-3-ols were good inhibitors of lipoxygenase activity.",1
"Volatile components from tortilla chips were isolated by high flow dynamic headspace sampling using a closed loop system with excess anhydrous sodium sulfate and trapping the volatiles on Tenax. Capillary GC−MS was used to identify the components. Major volatiles identified included 2-methylpyrazine, 1-hydroxy-2-propanone, 4-vinylguaiacol, 2-acetyltetrahydropyridine, (E,E)- and (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal, acetic acid, 3-methylbutanal, γ-butyrolactone, furfuryl alcohol, and 2,5-dimethylpyrazine. Concentration/threshold ratios indicated that the components that have the highest probability to contribute to the aroma and flavor include (E,E)- and (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal, (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, 3-methylbutanal, 2-furfurylthiol, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2-acetyltetrahydropyridine, 2-aminoacetophenone, 4-vinylguaiacol, (E)-2-nonenal, 2-methylbutanal, 2-propionyl-1-pyrroline, (E)-2-decenal, methional, and 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine.",1
"Secondary phenolic metabolites play an important role in plant defense mechanisms, and increasing evidence indicates that many are important in human health. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of various agricultural practices on levels of secondary plant metabolites. To address this issue, the total phenolic (TP) content of marionberries, strawberries, and corn grown by sustainable, organic, or conventional cultural practices were measured. Additionally, the effects of three common postharvest processing treatments (freezing, freeze-drying, and air-drying) on the TP content of these agricultural products were also investigated. Statistically higher levels of TPs were consistently found in organically and sustainably grown foods as compared to those produced by conventional agricultural practices. In all samples, freeze-drying preserved higher levels of TPs in comparison with air-drying.",1
"It is well known that transporter and enzyme genes could be regulated by microRNA (miRNA) at the post-transcriptional level, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA, which are involved in the miRNA production and structure, may impact the miRNA expression level and then influence drug transport and metabolism. In this study, we aim to evaluate the association between miRNA polymorphisms and high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) hematological toxicities in Chinese pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A total of 181 children with ALL were administered with 654 evaluable cycles of HD-MTX. Their hematological toxicities were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5. The association between 15 candidate SNPs of miRNA and hematological toxicities (leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) was analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Further multiple backward logistic regression analysis was used to explore the independent risk factors for grade 3/4 hematological toxicities. Rs2114358 G>A in pre-hsa-miR-1206 was related to HD-MTX-related grade 3/4 leukopenia after multiple logistic regression [GA + AA vs. GG: odds ratio (OR): 2.308, 95% CI: 1.219-4.372, Rs2114358 G>A and rs56103835 T>C polymorphism may potentially influence HD-MTX-related hematological toxicities, which may serve as candidate clinical biomarkers to predict grade 3/4 hematological toxicities in pediatric patients with ALL.",0
"L-Asparaginase (LA; EC 3.5.1.1) is a clinically and industrially relevant enzyme that hydrolyzes L-asparagine to L-aspartate and ammonia. LA has demonstrated efficacy as a chemotherapeutic agent by depleting L-asparagine, an amino acid essential for leukemic cell survival. FDA-approved formulations derived from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi face challenges, including a short half-life and adverse side effects, necessitating continuous efforts to develop more stable and specific variants. Concurrently, LA's role in acrylamide mitigation during food processing has garnered attention, supported by thermostable and high-yield fungal and bacterial strains. This review provides a comprehensive overview of LA's multifaceted roles, highlighting its therapeutic significance in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its role in acrylamide mitigation during food processing. It highlights exciting developments in the field, from discovering novel microbial sources to engineering the enzyme for improved performance. It also examines scalable production methodologies like submerged and solid-state fermentation, which are key to meeting growing demand. The review also highlights innovative strategies such as structural modifications and immobilization techniques aimed at enhancing enzyme stability, substrate specificity and therapeutic efficacy. This review demonstrates the transformative potential of LA in both healthcare and industrial contexts through integrating recent breakthroughs and innovative approaches. The insights provided aim to guide future research and innovation, paving the way for the development of optimized and sustainable applications of this crucial enzyme.",0
"Risk-adapted treatment protocols conferred remarkable improvement in the survival rates of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL). Nevertheless, clinical management is still challenging in certain molecular subgroups and in the presence of alterations associated with an increased rate of relapse. In this study, disease-relevant genomic and transcriptomic profiles were established in a prospective, multicenter, real-world cohort involving 192 children diagnosed with ALL/LBL. Gene fusions were detected in 34.9% of B-ALL and 46.4% of T-ALL patients, with novel chimeric genes involving JAK2, KMT2A, PAX5, RUNX1, and NOTCH1, and with KMT2A-rearranged patients displaying the worst 3-year event-free survival (P = .019). Nonsynonymous mutations were uncovered in 74.9% of the analyzed patients, and pairwise scrutiny of genetic lesions revealed recurrent clonal selection mechanisms commonly converging on the same pathway (eg, Ras, JAK/STAT, and Notch) in individual patients. Investigation of matched diagnostic and relapse samples unraveled complex subclonal variegation, and mutations affecting the NT5C2, TP53, CDKN2A, and PIK3R1 genes, emerging at the time of relapse. TP53 and CREBBP mutations, even as subclonal aberrations, were associated with shorter 3-year event-free survival among all patients with B-ALL (TP53 mutant vs wild-type: P = .008, CREBBP mutant vs wild-type: P = .010), and notably, B-ALL patients showing no measurable residual disease on day 33 could be further stratified based on TP53 mutational status (P < .001). Our in-depth molecular characterization performed across all risk groups identified novel opportunities for molecularly targeted therapy in 55.9% of high-risk and 31.6% of standard/intermediate-risk patients.",0
"To explore the clinical characteristics of children with acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and analyze their relationship with prognosis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data and follow-up results of 50 children with T-ALL who were treated using the CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol at the Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from November 2015 to December 2019. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression analysis were employed to identify factors affecting prognosis. Among the 50 T-ALL patients, there were 7 cases of relapse. There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline clinical data between the relapse group and the non-relapse group ( MRD is of significant importance for the prognosis of T-ALL children. Personalized treatment should be provided based on MRD levels to prevent relapse and improve prognosis in these patients.",0
"Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol (SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.",1
"The highest concentrations of complexed and polymeric flavanols were found in the early runnings from a small-scale mash tun. Formation of break during and after boiling was accompanied by the removal of flavanols from solution, especially the complexed and polymeric fractions. Variations in boiling procedure affected the amount of break formed, the amount of residual soluble flavanols and the colloidal stability of the resultant worts. Colloidal stability in beer was influenced by the contents of simple flavanols and the availability of air during storage. Dimeric and trimeric flavanols seemed especially susceptible to oxidation which implied an important role in haze formation. Flavanols found in commercial beers were mainly monomeric and complexed forms.",1
"The content and relative amounts of anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCA) were determined in local sweet cherries (cultivar Petrovka) at 7 stages of maturity, by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and compared to instrumentally assessed skin colour of the same sweet cherries. Skin colour of harvested samples was measured using the CIE L*,a*,b* system. The contents of neochlorogenic and 3′-p-coumarylquinnic acids decreased with no significant change in ratio during ripening, except for the first 4 days of maturation, when the ratio changed due to increased content of neochlorogenic acid. The linear increase of total anthocyanins during maturation was observed without the trend of stabilization in the final stages of maturity. The colour change of Petrovka during maturation was influenced by the increase of total anthocyanins, consisting mostly of cyanidin-3-rutinoside and cyanidin-3-glucoside (97–98% of the total). The chroma and L* values appeared to be optimal indicators of anthocyanin accumulation during maturation, and better than the a* value and hue angle. The accumulation of anthocyanins from 507.1 to 1150.9mg of cyanidin-3-rutinoside/kg of fresh weight (FW) during the second half of maturation caused the formation of a new colour cast of Petrovka, which influenced the decrease of redness and colour intensity, as recognized by CIE L*,a*,b* colour space.",1
"The presence of supernumerary chromosomes is the only abnormality shared by all patients diagnosed with high-hyperdiploid B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HD-ALL). Despite being the most frequently diagnosed pediatric leukemia, the lack of clonal molecular lesions and complete absence of appropriate experimental models have impeded the elucidation of HD-ALL leukemogenesis. Here, we report that for 23 leukemia samples isolated from moribund Eμ-Ret mice, all were characterized by non-random chromosomal gains, involving combinations of trisomy 9, 12, 14, 15, and 17. With a median gain of three chromosomes, leukemia emerged after a prolonged latency from a preleukemic B cell precursor cell population displaying more diverse aneuploidy. Transition from preleukemia to overt disease in Eμ-Ret mice is associated with acquisition of heterogeneous genomic abnormalities affecting the expression of genes implicated in pediatric B-ALL. The development of abnormal centrosomes in parallel with aneuploidy renders both preleukemic and leukemic cells sensitive to inhibitors of centrosome clustering, enabling targeted in vivo depletion of leukemia-propagating cells. This study reveals the Eμ-Ret mouse to be a novel tool for investigating HD-ALL leukemogenesis, including supervision and selection of preleukemic aneuploid clones by the immune system and identification of vulnerabilities that could be targeted to prevent relapse.",0
"The delivery of health services around the world faced considerable disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this has been discussed for a number of conditions in the adult population, related patterns have been studied less for children. In light of the detrimental effects of the pandemic, particularly for children and young people under the age of 18, it is pivotal to explore this issue further. Based on complete national hospital discharge data available via the German National Institute for the Reimbursement of Hospitals (InEK) data browser, we compare the top 30 diagnoses for which children were hospitalised in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. We analyse the development of monthly admissions between January 2019 and December 2022 for three tracers of variable time-sensitivity: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), appendicitis/appendectomy and tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy. Compared to 2019, total admissions were approximately 20% lower in 2020 and 2021, and 13% lower in 2022. The composition of the most frequent principal diagnoses remained similar across years, although changes in rank were observed. Decreases were observed in 2020 for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, with cases increasing again in 2021. The number of ALL admissions showed an upward trend and a periodicity prima vista unrelated to pandemic factors. Appendicitis admissions decreased by about 9% in 2020 and a further 8% in 2021 and 4% in 2022, while tonsillectomies/adenoidectomies decreased by more than 40% in 2020 and a further 32% in 2021 before increasing in 2022; for these tracers, monthly changes are in line with pandemic waves. Hospital care for critical and urgent conditions among patients under the age of 18 was largely upheld in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially at the expense of elective treatments. There is an alignment between observed variations in hospitalisations and pandemic mitigation measures, possibly also reflecting changes in demand. This study highlights the need for comprehensive, intersectoral data that would be necessary to better understand changing demand, unmet need/foregone care and shifts from inpatient to outpatient care, as well as their link to patient outcomes and health care efficiency.",0
Quinic acid and glucose esters of hydroxycinnamic acids and glucosides of hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids have been determined by capillary GC and HPLC in soft fruits. The results confirm the wide distribution of these compounds in fruit tissues.,1
"In March 2024, ponatinib received accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) in combination with chemotherapy based on the Phase 3 PhALLCON study (NCT03589326), which demonstrated a higher rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete remission (CR) at the end of induction (EOI) with ponatinib (34.4%) versus imatinib (16.7%; p = 0.002). Patients received ponatinib (30 mg QD with reduction to 15 mg QD upon achievement of MRD-negative CR at EOI) or imatinib (600 mg QD) combined with 20 cycles of reduced-intensity chemotherapy (induction: 3 cycles; consolidation: 6 cycles; and maintenance: 11 cycles). Ponatinib pharmacokinetics (PK) were similar in patients in PhALLCON and patients in a previous population PK analysis. Bayesian re-estimation of the previously developed population PK model adequately described PhALLCON PK data. Exposure-efficacy analyses did not identify a significant relationship between ponatinib exposure and the probability of MRD-negative CR at EOI (p = 0.619), suggesting a consistent efficacy benefit across exposures. Ponatinib exposure was not a significant predictor of arterial occlusive events, venous thromboembolic events, thrombocytopenia, or lipase increase (p > 0.05). However, higher exposures were associated with a higher probability of hypertension (p = 0.0340) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase (p = 0.0034). Dose reduction from 30 to 15 mg was predicted to decrease the odds of experiencing hypertension by 37.7% and ALT increase by 44.2%. Collectively, exposure-response analyses support a favorable benefit-risk profile of the approved ponatinib dosage (30 mg QD reduced to 15 mg QD upon achievement of MRD-negative CR at EOI), combined with chemotherapy, for frontline treatment of Ph + ALL.",0
"The antiradical activity, polyphenols, flavonoids and total condensed tannins contents have been determined in the case of seven local edible Brassicaceae, i.e. Italian kale, broccoli, Savoy and white cabbage, cauliflower, green cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Rapid spectrophotometric methods were applied. The results achieved were compared with the quali–quantitative information obtained by HPLC/DAD and HPLC/MS. The polyphenolic compounds detected were: kaempferol and quercetin glycosides and hydroxycinnamic esters. The EC50 values ranged from 81.45 to 917.81mg sample/mg DPPH and the total phenolic content from 4.30 to 13.80 gallic acid equivalents (mg gallic acid/g sample). The peculiar characteristics of these vegetables can be evaluated and can increase their value as functional food.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a highly aggressive hematological malignancy that necessitates safer, more effective therapies. This study applied a multi-parametric computational approach to identify KRAS (G12C) inhibitors from African natural product databases. Six lead compounds (NA/EA-1 to NA/EA-6) were identified via virtual screening, molecular docking, and induced-fit docking, all showing stronger binding affinities (-14.50 to -10.53 kcal/mol) than the reference inhibitor Sotorasib (-8.34 kcal/mol). These candidates exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties, minimal Lipinski's rule violations, and non-toxic ADMET profiles. Four top hits were subjected to 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations, with NA/EA-3 demonstrating the greatest stability, lowest RMSD, and strongest hydrogen bonding. MM/GBSA analysis confirmed NA/EA-3 as the most promising compound (ΔG",0
"Two huckleberry species, Vaccinium membranaceum and Vaccinium ovatum, native to Pacific Northwestern North America, were evaluated for their total, and individual, anthocyanin and polyphenolic compositions. Vaccinium ovatum had greater total anthocyanin (ACY), total phenolics (TP), oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) than did V. membranaceum. The pH and degrees Brix were also higher in V. ovatum. Berry extracts from each species were separated into three different fractions--anthocyanin, polyphenolic, and sugar/acid-by solid-phase extraction. The anthocyanin fractions of each species had the highest amount of ACY, TP, and antioxidant activity. Each species contained 15 anthocyanins (galactoside, glucoside, and arabinoside of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin) but in different proportions. Their anthocyanin profiles were similar by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (LC-DAD) and high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array and mass spectrometry detections (LC-DAD-MS). Each species had a different polyphenolic profile. The polyphenolics of both species were mainly composed of cinnamic acid derivatives and flavonol glycosides. The major polyphenolic compound in V. membranaceum was neochlorogenic acid, and in V. ovatum, chlorogenic acid.",1
"IntroductionHigh-dose Vitamin C has shown significant anti-tumor effects in various cancers, including hematological malignancies. However, its therapeutic efficacy against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains underexplored.MethodsALL cell lines and normal bone marrow mononuclear cells were treated with Vitamin C to assess cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation, and cell cycle progression. Colony formation assays evaluated long-term growth. Additionally, transgenic mouse models were employed to evaluate the",0
"Acute leukaemias (AL) are a group of heterogeneous malignancies characterised by clonal hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. Despite advances in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in developed countries, outcomes in developing countries like Armenia are thought to be substantially worse. The aim of this article is to understand how the limitations in diagnostic and treatment modalities in Armenia impact the clinical outcomes of AL patients and by presenting it to health authorities contribute to the development of evidence-based policies and regulatory improvements to enhance patient care. We interrogated data from 431 adults representing all cases of adult AL in Armenia at the Hematology Centre of Armenia from 1 January 2016, to 31 December 2020. Death data were obtained from the United Information System of Electronic Healthcare in the Republic of Armenia. There were some limitations with data collection due to the absence of a unified electronic database and detailed paper records. Over the 5 years a total of 431 patients were diagnosed with AL at the Hematology Centre of Armenia of which 310 (72%) died. Male patients' number was 131 (54%). Median age was 59 years (Interquartile Range = 50, 18-85 years). A morphological complete remission before death was reached in 82 (34%) patients, including 24 dying without relapse. Additionally, 50 subjects (20%) died during induction chemotherapy including 9 with ALL, 37 with AML and 1 with mixed-lineage leukaemia. Causes of death included no response to treatment ( The results of AL therapy in Armenia are worse than those reported in developed countries, where overall survival is about 60%. The major reasons are leukaemia progression and treatment-related complications.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is characterized by the combination of T-cell lineage and the presence of immaturity marker(s). Sometimes, the most common immaturity markers for initial flow cytometry screening in T-ALL may be negative, which can be a diagnostic pitfall. When a lack of common first-line immaturity markers is encountered in combination with gamma/delta T-cell receptor expression, a misdiagnosis of mature gamma-delta T-cell leukemia/lymphoma could be rendered. Here, we discuss two T-ALL cases with the absence of common flow cytometry immaturity markers and positive gamma/delta receptor expression.",0
"Some physicochemical and microstructural characteristics of hard-to-cook (HTC) and easy-to-cook (ETC) pinto beans and small-type lentils were compared. The development of HTC seeds was monitored over 6 months for changes in physicochemical properties. Results indicated that hardness, extent of water absorption and solid loss of HTC legumes were, respectively, 21–97%, 7–72% and 62–236% higher than those of ETC legumes. In addition, darkening of HTC beans and lentils was significantly higher than those of ETC ones. Scanning electron microscope observations indicated deteriorations in cytoplasmic contents of cotyledon cells of hard seeds. Phytic acid and total phenolic contents were, respectively, decreased 36–61% and 43–61% during storage, whereas hardness of seeds was increased 3–6 times. The soaking of hard seeds in sodium solutions resulted in the improvement in legume texture.",1
"In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins (LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should specify the oils used.",1
"The polyphenols in various parts of the tea plant used in manufacture of tea products (young leaves, old leaves, and stem) were analyzed by HPLC. The young leaves (apical bud and the two youngest leaves) were found to be richer (2.7-fold) in polyphenols than old leaves (from the tenth to the fifth leaf). Also, the tea polyphenols were found to be higher (1.4-fold) in summer than in spring. Ten different types of commercial tea (manufactured tea), including unfermented, semifermented, and fermented tea, were analyzed for their polyphenol compounds, and it was found that both yields of solids in tea water extracts (TWEs) and the amount of (−)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) in these products varied with different tea leaves and processing methods. Longjing tea (unfermented green tea) contained the highest concentration of EGCG and polyphenols, whereas Assam black tea (most fermented) contained the least. Longjing TWEs showed strong inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis in A-431 tumor cells. We also found that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and EGCG strongly inhibited tumor cell DNA synthesis and peroxyl-radical generation. The evidence suggests that the strong antioxidative and antiproliferative activities of Longjing TWEs and GTPs are mainly due to the higher contents of tea polyphenols. EGCG (the major component of GTPs) showed strong inhibitory action on the growth of immortalized cells (NIH3T3) and tumor cells (S-180II) but almost no effect on the growth of normal cells (C3H10T1/2).",1
"The contents of soluble and total phenolic acids were analyzed in samples of 29 berries and berry products, 24 fruits and fruit peels, and 12 beverages. Variation of phenolic acids in berries was also studied. Soluble phenolic acids were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, and a tentative quantification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total phenolic acid content was determined by HPLC after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The content of total phenolic acids as aglycones in the above samples varied from 0 (pear cider) to 103 mg/100 g fresh weight (rowanberry). Besides rowanberry, the best phenolic acid sources among berries were chokeberry (96 mg/100 g), blueberry (85 mg/100 g), sweet rowanberry (75 mg/100 g), and saskatoon berry (59 mg/100 g). Among fruits, the highest contents (28 mg/100 g) were determined in dark plum, cherry, and one apple variety (Valkea Kuulas). Coffee (97 mg/100 g) as well as green and black teas (30-36 mg/100 g) were the best sources among beverages. Caffeic acid dominated in all of these samples except in tea brews. Variation in the phenolic acid contents of the berries was either small or moderate.",1
"The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as ""olive oil"" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.",1
"A capillary zone electrophoresis method has been carried out to determine and quantitate some compounds of the polyphenolic fraction of virgin olive oil which have never previously been determined before using capillary electrophoresis, such as elenolic acid, ligstroside aglycon, oleuropein aglycon, and (+)-pinoresinol. The compounds were identified using standards obtained by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detailed method optimization was performed to separate the phenolic compounds present in olive oil using a methanol-water extract of Picual extra-virgin olive oil, and different extraction systems were compared (C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), Diol-SPE, Sax-SPE and liquid-liquid extraction). The optimized parameters were 30 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.3) at 25 kV with 8 s hydrodynamic injection, and the quantitation was carried out by the use of two reference compounds at two different wavelengths.",1
"Sesame seed contains lignans and lignan glycosides. The antioxidative activity of the crude extract of lignan glycosides obtained from unroasted defatted black sesame seeds was investigated in this study. The components responsible for the antioxidative activity were also studied. The unroasted black sesame seeds, after defatted with n-hexane, were extracted with 80% methanolic solution to prepare for the crude extract of lignan glycosides. After chromatographic separation of this crude extract with octadecylsilane (ODS) column (2.5 cm i.d.×100 cm), four fractions (Fr1, Fr2, Fr3, Fr4) of the crude extract were obtained from the eluents of 25, 50, 75% aqueous methanolic solution and 100% methanol, respectively. Among them, Fr2 and Fr3 showed better antioxidative activity by 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) antioxidative assay. These two fractions were further purified by preparative HPLC (Hyperprep 100 C18 column; 20 mm i.d.×250 mm) and the main constituents were found to be lignan glycosides and some unknown brown materials. It was interesting to find that the brown materials (in Fr2) exhibited exceptional DPPH free radical scavenging effect, whereas the identified sesaminol triglucoside in Fr2 and sesaminol diglucoside in Fr3 possess no such activity. Using Cu+2-induced oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) for the antioxidative assay, similar results were observed. Seaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside showed no effect on the extension of lag phase, while the brown materials had excellent inhibitory effect on the oxidation of LDL. Furthermore, natural antioxidants such as γ-tocopherol, sesamol and sesaminol were not detected in the crude extract of lignan glycosides. Our findings suggest that the brown materials present in Fr2 had a significant contribution to the antioxidative activity of the crude extract of lignan glycosides. Identification of the responsible components is underway.",1
"It has been shown that thermal processing of tomatoes and sweet corn results in increased antioxidant activities despite the loss of vitamin C. Until now, it is unclear whether this positive effect of thermal processing occurs with all crop produce. Therefore, analysis of a root vegetable (beets) and of a legume (green beans) was undertaken to address this question. Antioxidant activity of beets processed under typical commercial processing conditions remained constant despite an 8% loss of vitamin C, a 60% loss of color, and 30% loss of dietary folate. There was a slight but significant 5% increase in phenolic content of processed beets. In contrast, vitamin C and dietary folate content of green beans remained constant, whereas a 32% reduction in phenolic compounds occurred after typical commercial processing conditions. The antioxidant activity of green beans was reduced by 20%. These findings along with previous works suggest that the effects of thermal processing vary with the respective produce crop type. It also reinforces the concept that optimal health benefits may be achieved when a wide variety of plant foods (fruits, vegetables and whole grains) and preparation methods are incorporated into the diet.",1
"Forty pediatric (0-12 years) B-ALL DNA samples (20 paired Diagnosis-Relapse) and an additional six B-ALL DNA samples (without relapse at 3 years post treatment), as the non-relapse arm, were retrieved from the biobank for advanced genomic analysis. Deep sequencing (1050-5000X; mean 1600X) was performed using a custom NGS panel of 74 genes incorporating unique molecular barcodes. A total 47 major clones (>25% VAF) and 188 minor clones were noted in 40 cases after bioinformatic data filtering. Of the forty-seven major clones, eight (17%) were diagnosis-specific, seventeen (36%) were relapse-specific and 11 (23%) were shared. In the control arm, no pathogenic major clone was noted in any of the six samples. The most common clonal evolution pattern observed was therapy-acquired (TA), with 9/20 (45%), followed by M-M, with 5/20 (25%), m-M, with 4/20 (20%) and unclassified (UNC) 2/20 (10%). The TA clonal pattern was predominant in early relapses 7/12 (58%), with 71% (5/7) having major clonal mutations in the Our study highlights the high frequency of early relapses driven by TA clones, demonstrating the need to identify their early rise during chemotherapy by digital PCR.",0
"With the advent of targeted therapeutics in Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), there is a growing survivor population that might be at risk for late mortality from non-LCH causes, including second primary malignancies (SPMs). We undertook a large study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to evaluate the patterns of SPMs and cause-specific mortality among individuals with LCH (2000-2016) from the US. We found an increased risk of SPMs in the cohort (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 2.07). The pediatric group was at a high risk of developing Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 60.93) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR 60.88). People with adult-onset LCH were found to have a high risk of developing miscellaneous malignant cancers (SIR 11.43), which primarily included myelodysplastic syndrome. Adults were also at a high risk of developing carcinoma in-situ of vulva at 2-11 months [SIR 62.72] and B-ALL at 60-119 months [SIR 66.29] after LCH diagnosis. Additionally, 5% and 1% of the patients developed prior or concomitant malignancies with LCH, respectively. The 5 yr overall survival (OS) was 96.6% for pediatric and 88.5% for adult LCH cohorts. Most common cause of death was infections in pediatric and SPMs in adult LCH. Our study highlights that despite advances in treatments, people with LCH have an increased mortality risk from non-LCH causes when compared with the general population, including a high risk of SPMs.",0
"Monoclonal antibodies targeting CD22, a B-cell surface antigen overexpressed in hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), have shown promise for targeted immunotherapy. Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) offer enhanced modularity for CAR-T platforms, and linker length between VH and VL domains is known to influence their conformation and binding. Here, we systematically compared two anti-CD22 scFvs with short (GGGGS) or long ((GGGGS)₄) linkers. Using molecular dynamics simulations (in aqueous and membrane environments), bio-layer interferometry (BLI), and flow cytometry, we found that membrane proximity influences binding, and the short-linker scFv exhibited higher affinity (Kd = 5.1 nM vs. 42.1 nM), slower dissociation, and greater avidity for CD22. Binding free energy decomposition and RMSD analyses revealed a more stable interface for the short-linker construct, especially near the membrane. SEC analysis showed a modestly higher dimeric fraction for the short-linker scFv, although flow cytometry indicated comparable CD22 binding across monomeric and dimeric forms. These findings support linker engineering as a strategy to optimize scFv performance and inform the rational design of CAR-T receptors with improved therapeutic potential.",0
"Epigenetic alterations are hallmarks of cancer, with histone modifiers playing critical roles in gene transcription, DNA homeostasis, and other nuclear functions. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a key regulator of H3K4 methylation, has emerged as a promising pharmacological target in cancer treatment, including leukemia. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric cancer, remains a significant therapeutic challenge due to limited understanding of how epigenetic therapy impacts leukemia dissemination. In this study, we demonstrate that targeting LSD1 enhances the invasive capacity of ALL cells, inducing an elongated, invasive phenotype and increasing nuclear deformability. Using a 3D matrix model, LSD1 inhibition promoted ALL cell invasion without significantly affecting the cell cycle progression or apoptosis under the tested conditions. Interestingly, LSD1 targeting reduced ALL cell spreading and tissue colonization in vivo, suggesting differential effects depending on the cellular context. Our findings indicate that LSD1 inhibition impairs chemotactic responses and transendothelial migration, key processes for extravasation and in vivo invasiveness. These results reveal a dual role for LSD1 in leukemia cell migration: promoting invasiveness in 3D environments while reducing extravasation and chemotaxis in vivo. This dual effect underscores the importance of cellular context in determining therapeutic outcomes and the development of strategies targeting specific stages of leukemia dissemination.",0
"Soy isoflavones were quantified from human milk by a fast, precise, and selective HPLC method after enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated isoflavones and extraction with ethyl acetate. Isoflavone aglycones and their mammalian metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin were separated selectively and identified by absorbance patterns, fluorometric and electrochemical detection, gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis after trimethylsilylation, and with internal and external authentic standards. HPLC injections of 20 microL of human milk showed detection limits of 1-3 pmol for all analytes by using diode-array detection. The detection limit could be improved by as much as 1000-fold by extended concentration through partitioning with ethyl acetate, by using electrochemical detection, by increasing the injection volumes, or by combining these techniques. We used the proposed method to monitor isoflavone concentrations in human milk and in human urine after challenge with 5, 10, and 20 g of roasted soybeans in the diet. Implications of the results for the potential of isoflavones to prevent cancer in newborn infants exposed to these agents are discussed.",1
"The intake of alkylresorcinols and lignans in Spain is unknown due to the lack of information on the content of these compounds in particular foods. This paper describes the development of the first alkylresorcinol and lignan database adapted to the Spanish diet, including foods items especially relevant for this population. The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.",1
"Although a great cure rate has been achieved for pediatric BCP-ALL, approximately 15% of patients do not respond to conventional chemotherapy and experience disease relapse. A major effort to improve the cure rates by treatment intensification would result in an undesirable increase in treatment-related toxicity and mortality, raising the need to identify novel therapeutic approaches. High-throughput (HTP) drug screening enables the profiling of patients' responses in vitro and allows the repurposing of compounds currently used for other diseases, which can be immediately available for clinical application. The aim of this study was to apply HTP drug screening to identify potentially effective compounds for the treatment of pediatric BCP-ALL patients with poor prognosis, such as patients with Down Syndrome (DS) or carrying rearrangements involving PAX5 or KMT2A/MLL genes. Patient-derived Xenografts (PDX) samples from 34 BCP-ALL patients (9 DS CRLF2r, 15 PAX5r, 10 MLLr), 7 human BCP-ALL cell lines and 14 hematopoietic healthy donor samples were screened on a semi-automated HTP drug screening platform using a 174 compound library (FDA/EMA-approved or in preclinical studies). We identified 9 compounds active against BCP-ALL (ABT-199/venetoclax, AUY922/luminespib, dexamethasone, EC144, JQ1, NVP-HSP990, paclitaxel, PF-04929113 and vincristine), but sparing normal cells. Ex vivo validations confirmed that the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax exerts an anti-leukemic effect against all three ALL subgroups at nanomolar concentrations. Overall, this study points out the benefit of HTP screening application for drug repurposing to allow the identification of effective and clinically translatable therapeutic agents for difficult-to-treat childhood BCP-ALL subgroups.",0
"To explore the mechanism of ursolic acid (UA) against acute B lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) based on network pharmacological analysis, molecular docking and experimental verification. The core targets, functional processes, and biological pathways of UA in B-ALL were predicted by network pharmacology and molecular docking. The efficacy and mechanism of UA against B-ALL were verified through in vitro experiments such as cell viability assays, CCK-8 assays, LDH assays, AO/EB staining, flow cytometry, and Western blot assays. Network pharmacology analysis of the core targets indicated that the effects of UA on B-ALL were related to programmed cell death (apoptosis and pyroptosis). Molecular docking results showed that Our findings demonstrated that UA could induce Reh cell apoptosis and pyroptosis by activating the JNK signalling pathway to exert anti-B-ALL effects. This indicates that UA may become a potential drug for the effective treatment of B-ALL.",0
"The outlook of relapsed ALL in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is dismal due to high treatment-related toxicities and inadequate resources. We report our experience of using a locally adapted mitoxantrone-based protocol for non-high risk (HR) relapsed B-ALL (rALL). A retrospective cum prospective study of standard and intermediate risk (SR and IR) rALL patients treated on TMH rALL-18 protocol (adapted from COG/UKALLR3/Int-Re-ALL protocols) between November 2018 and January 2021 was analyzed. The protocol comprising of 7 blocks of multi-agent chemotherapy including mitoxantrone in induction followed by local irradiation and maintenance, underwent serial modifications based on our experience with initial patients. Eighty-two patients (SR rALL, 3; IR rALL, 79) were treated on TMH rALL-18 protocol. Of 321 grade 3/4 reported toxicities, around 43% (138 toxicities) were noted during induction. Induction chemotherapy was outpatient-based; however, 68 patients (82.9%) required supportive care admissions. Twelve out of 19 patients with gram negative bacilli sepsis (included 7 MDRO) died during reinduction. Five remission deaths were seen during block 3 after which cytarabine was dose reduced (3 g to 2 g/m",0
"Hematologic malignancy is a risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults; however, data specific to children with leukemia are limited. High-quality infectious adverse event data from the ongoing Children's Oncology Group (COG) standard-risk B acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LLy) trial, AALL1731, were analyzed to provide a disease-specific estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes in pediatric ALL. Of 253 patients with reported infections, the majority (77.1%) were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (CTCAE grade 1/2) and there was a single COVID-19-related death. These data suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection does not confer substantial morbidity among young patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LLy).",0
"Aberrant antigen expression was reported to be due to genetic and epigenetic dysregulation. This study aimed to address aberrant antigen expression and its link to poor prognostic genetic markers in acute leukemia patients. This study included 432 newly diagnosed acute leukemia patients (AML, B-ALL). For all included patients blast cells expression for line assignment CD33 CD13 on B-All and CD7 on cytogenetically normal-AML blasts was assessed by flow cytometry in parallel to FLT3 and Philadelphia and philadelphia like chromosome in B-ALL. From the total 432 cases of acute leukemia, the most frequent aberrant antigen expressed in B acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) was CD33 (23.3%) followed by CD13(16.7%); while the most frequent one in AML was CD7 (16.7%). Aberrant myeloid phenotype in B-ALL was associated with lower mean total leukocytes count (TLC), low platelets count, positive Philadelphia like chromosome, shorter overall survival compared to the B-ALL without. Aberrant lymphoid phenotype (CD7) in AML was associated with a higher platelets count, FLT3 mutation, shorter disease-free and overall survival compared to those patients without. CD7 aberrant antigen expression is frequently detected in patients with CN-AML and frequently associated with FLT3 mutation. While in patients with B-ALL the most frequently detected ones are CD33 and CD13 which are frequently associated with Philadelphia like chromosome.",0
"Therapeutic management and prognostication for patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) require appropriate disease subclassification. BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL is unique in that it is defined by a gene expression profile similar to BCR::ABL1+ B-ALL rather than a unifying recurrent translocation. Current molecular/cytogenetic techniques to identify this subtype are expensive, not widely accessible, have long turnaround times and/or require an adequate liquid biopsy. We have studied a total of 118 B-ALL cases from three institutions in two laboratories to identify surrogates for BCR::ABL1+/like B-ALL. We report that immunoglobulin joining chain (IGJ) and spermatogenesis associated serine-rich 2-like (SPATS2L) immunohistochemistry (IHC) sensitively and specifically identify BCR::ABL1+/like B-ALL. IGJ IHC positivity has a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 95%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90%. SPATS2L staining has similar sensitivity and NPV but lower specificity (85%) and PPV (70%). The presence of either IGJ or SPATS2L staining augments the sensitivity (93%) and NPV (95%). While these findings would need to be validated in larger studies, they suggest that IGJ and/or SPATS2L IHC may be utilized in identifying BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL or in selecting B-ALL cases for confirmatory molecular/genetic testing, particularly in resource-limited settings.",0
"Consumption of tomato products has been associated with decreased risk of some cancer types. Epidemiological findings confirm the observed health effects due to the presence of varied antioxidants in tomato. The bio-antioxidant content and antioxidant activity of 12 tomato genotypes was therefore studied. Significant differences were found between lycopene, ascorbic acid and phenolic contents among various genotypes. Lycopene and ascorbic acid contents showed 1–4 fold and 1–2 fold variation on both fresh and dry weight basis, respectively. Antioxidant activity was found to vary significantly among genotypes. In both free radical quenching assay and FRAP assay, significant activity was found. Activity was higher in the hexane fraction containing lycopene than the methanol fraction containing phenolics. Tomato peels, in addition to lycopene, contain significantly high amounts of ascorbic acid and phenols. Cherry tomatoes, particularly variety 818 cherry, with the highest contents of antioxidants (lycopene, ascorbic acid and phenols) and highest antioxidant activity represents a valuable genotype not only for improving the status of dietary antioxidants in our diet but also for increasing nutritional value through germplasm enhancement programmes. The cherry varieties also merit considerable attention for processing because of their high total soluble solids and titrable acidity.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent cause of childhood cancer and requires a long course of therapy consisting of three primary phases with interval intensification blocks. Although these phases are necessary to achieve remission, the primary chemotherapeutic agents have potentially serious toxicities, which may lead to delays or discontinuations of therapy. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive pharmacogenomic evaluation of common antileukemic agents and develop a polygenic toxicity risk score predictive of the most common toxicities observed during ALL treatment. This cross-sectional study included 75 patients with pediatric ALL treated between 2012 and 2020 at the University of Florida. Toxicity data were collected within 100 days of initiation of therapy using CTCAE v4.0 for toxicity grading. For pharmacogenomic evaluation, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes were selected from previous reports or PharmGKB database. 116 unique SNPs were evaluated for incidence of various toxicities. A multivariable multi-SNP modeling for up to 3-SNP combination was performed to develop a polygenic toxicity risk score of prognostic value. We identified several SNPs predictive of toxicity phenotypes in univariate analysis. Further multivariable SNP-SNP combination analysis suggest that susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced toxicities is likely multigenic in nature. For 3-SNPscore models, patients with high scores experienced increased risk of GI ( Our results imply that instead of a single-SNP approach, SNP-SNP combinations in multiple genes in drug pathways increases the robustness of prediction of toxicity. These results further provide promising SNP models that can help establish clinically relevant biomarkers allowing for greater individualization of cancer therapy to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity for each patient.",0
"Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.",1
"Lineage switch is a rare phenomenon in which acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transforms into acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and vice versa, sharing the same clonal origin. It is more common for AML to relapse as ALL. Cytogenetics, microenvironment, and preceding therapies are associated with lineage switch. Since the etiology of lineage switch is unclear, presumptions include clonal selection, pluripotent stem cells, and differentiated cell trans-differentiation or re-differentiation. The key point for diagnosing lineage switch is that the relapsed tumor originates from the common cell of the primary leukemia, although it is occasionally derived via clonal evolution. It is very important to distinguish lineage switch from other illnesses, such as secondary leukemia or the blast phase of chronic leukemia. Although direct treatment of the present lineage results in an improved prognosis, the outcome of these patients remains poor, with low survival and rapid progression. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can extend survival. Lineage switch risk-adapted management stratification may be beneficial for detecting relapse and more promptly provide suitable therapy. Efficient and toxicity-restricted therapy is being developed to improve the very poor prognosis.",0
"Rearrangements of the histone-lysine-N-methyltransferase (KMT2A), previously referred to as mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL), are among the most common chromosomal abnormalities in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), involving numerous different fusion partners. KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) leukemia is characterized by a rapid onset, aggressive progression, and significantly worse prognosis compared to non-KMT2A-r leukemias. Even with contemporary chemotherapeutic treatments and hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT), patients with KMT2A-r leukemia typically experience poor outcomes and limited responses to these therapies. This review aims to consolidate recent studies on the general gene characteristics and associated mechanisms of KMT2A-r acute leukemia, as well as the cytogenetics, immunophenotype, clinical presentation, and risk stratification of both KMT2A-r-AML and KMT2A-r-ALL. Particularly, the treatment targets in KMT2A-r acute leukemia are examined. A comprehensive review was carried out by systematically synthesizing existing literature on PubMed, using the combination of the keywords 'KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemia', 'lymphoblastic leukemia', 'myeloid leukemia', and 'therapy'. The available studies were screened for selection based on quality and relevance. Studies indicate that KMT2A rearrangements are present in over 70% of infant leukemia cases, approximately 10% of adult AML cases, and numerous instances of secondary acute leukemias, making it a disease of critical concern to clinicians and researchers alike. The future of KMT2A-r acute leukemia research is characterized by an expanding knowledge of the disease's biology, with an emphasis on personalized therapies, immunotherapies, genomic advancements, and innovative therapeutic combinations. The overarching aim is to enhance patient outcomes, lessen the disease burden, and elevate the quality of life for those affected. Ongoing research and clinical trials in this area continue to offer promising opportunities for refining treatment strategies and improving patient prognosis.",0
"Beans were pearled to evaluate the feasibility of increasing antioxidant activity and phenolic antioxidants. Phenolics were concentrated mostly in the hull fraction at about 56 mg of catechin equivalents per gram of sample. The methanolic extracts of the pearled bean samples were screened for antioxidant potential using the β-carotene−linoleate and the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. The pearled material, also referred to as milled samples, exhibited antioxidant activity that correlated with phenolic content and inhibited DPPH significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Phenolics and antioxidant activities were also examined in chromatographic fractions of methanolic extracts of manually obtained hulls that represented a model used previously to ascertain antimutagenic activity. Fractions extracted with ethyl acetate/acetone and acetone displayed antioxidant activity, which implies potent free radical scavenging activity with antimutagenic activity.",1
"Current therapies for T-cell acute leukemia are based on risk stratification and have greatly improved the survival rate for patients, but mortality rates remain high owing to relapsed disease, therapy resistance, or treatment-related toxicities/infection. Patients with relapsed disease continue to have poor outcomes. In the past few years, newer agents have been investigated to optimize upfront therapies for higher-risk patients in the hopes of decreasing relapse rates. This review summarizes the progress of chemo/targeted therapies using Nelarabine/Bortezomib/CDK4/6 inhibitors for T-ALL in clinical trials and novel strategies to target NOTCH-induced T-ALL. We also outline immunotherapy clinical trials using monoclonal/bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies, anti-PD1/anti-PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR-T for T-ALL therapy. Overall, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials showed that applying monoclonal antibodies or CAR-T for relapsed/refractory T-ALL therapy is promising. The combination of target therapy and immunotherapy may be a novel strategy for T-ALL treatment.",0
"Aqueous extracts of most medicinal plants traditionally employed in Portugal (at the ratio of 1 g plant: 110 mL water) have been assayed for total antioxidant capacity and phenol content, in order to elucidate their claimed medicinal features.",1
"Tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) and brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) are approved CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T) products for young adults (YA) with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A distinct analysis of YAs receiving commercial CD19 CAR T has not been reported. Using retrospective data from the Pediatric Real-World CAR T Consortium and the Real-World Outcomes of CAR T in Adult ALL collaboration, we describe the efficacy and safety of tisa-cel and brexu-cel in 70 YAs (18-26 years; tisa-cel, n = 50; brexu-cel, n = 20). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were observed more frequently for brexu-cel vs tisa-cel (CRS, 85% vs 56%; ICANS, 40% vs 18%). Complete response rates were similar between products at 80% for brexu-cel and 88% for tisa-cel. Relapse-free survival (RFS) at 12 months was 46% for brexu-cel and 36% for tisa-cel. Durability of remission over 12 months was 61% for brexu-cel vs 41% for tisa-cel; 12-month overall survival (OS) for brexu-cel was 84% vs 68% for tisa-cel. In multivariate analysis, low disease burden was associated with improved OS, whereas inotuzumab before CAR T was associated with inferior outcomes. This study demonstrates comparable real-world efficacy among YAs receiving CD19 CAR T irrespective of CAR T construct; however, rates of toxicity seem higher with brexu-cel.",0
"A mobile health (mHealth) application can encourage parents and pediatric patients to be involved in caring for their child's health condition by providing the ability to identify and actively manage chemotherapy-related symptoms in their child. Several monitoring systems available today are diverse in features and system basis. This study aimed to develop and trial the Chemo Assist for Children (CAC) mHealth application for symptom management in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, the development of the CAC application went through multiple phases and methods. Study phases included: (1) development of the application's feature based on the need assessment, (2) creation of content of application based on literature review, (3) develop prototyping of CAC, (4) expert review and feedback on the application content, (5) usability testing by targeted end-user. Based on need assessment, it was determined that parents with leukemia children were interested in symptom management of chemotherapy and preferred mobile applications. Therefore, a mHealth application was designed to include features to identify symptoms and provide recommendation strategies to manage the symptom. Usability evaluation by end-user revealed that mHealth is a valid, accessible, and appropriate application for users. The CAC mHealth application developed can meet the needs of technology users to identify symptoms and manage chemotherapy-related symptoms in children with ALL. The CAC mHealth application can accommodate data not recorded at out-of-hospital care, increase the independence of symptom management, and improve communication between parents of children with ALL and health workers.",0
"Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.",1
"High-throughput total nucleic acid (TNA) purification methods based on solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads produce TNA suitable for both genomic and transcriptomic applications. Even so, small RNA species, including miRNA, bind weakly to SPRI beads under standard TNA purification conditions, necessitating a separate workflow using column-based methods that are difficult to automate. Here, an SPRI-based high-throughput TNA purification protocol that recovers DNA, RNA and small RNA, called GSC-modified RLT+ Aline bead-based protocol (GRAB-ALL), which incorporates modifications to enhance small RNA recovery is presented. GRAB-ALL was benchmarked against existing nucleic acid purification workflows and GRAB-ALL efficiently purifies TNA, including small RNA, for next-generation sequencing applications in a plate-based format suitable for automated high-throughput sample preparation.",0
"Despite the fact that condensed tannins are potentially important antioxidants, there is a general belief that tannins in sorghum confer objectionable sensory attributes. The objective of this study was to determine differences in the sensory attributes of sorghums containing different levels of total phenolic compounds. A trained sensory panel described and quantified the sensory attributes of different sorghums (condensed-tannin containing and tannin-free). All the sorghum cultivars were perceived as bitter and astringent. Bran infusions of tannin sorghums were perceived as darker, clearer, more bitter and more astringent than those of the tannin-free sorghums, while those of tannin-free sorghums were perceived as sweeter and cloudy. Sorghum whole-grain rice from the tannin sorghums which had relatively soft endosperm texture (PAN 3860 and Ex Nola 97 GH) was perceived as dark, hard, chewy, bitter and astringent, while that from tannin-free sorghums having relatively hard endosperm texture (Segaolane and Phofu) was perceived as soft, sweet and had a maize-flavour. Surprisingly, the bitterness and astringency, as well as other sensory attributes of NS 5511 (tannin sorghum), were perceived as similar to PAN 8564 (tannin-free sorghum) even though NS 5511 had more than twice the total phenol content of PAN 8564. This suggests not all condensed-tannin containing sorghums have objectionable sensory attributes. Copyright © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry",1
"The relationship between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and cardiac function is not well established. This study aimed to evaluate whether AML patients exist early myocardial damages prior to chemotherapy and to investigate its association with cardiovascular biomarkers. Conventional echocardiography and three-dimensional speckle-tracking strain analysis were performed prospectively in 72 acute leukemia (AL) patients before any chemotherapy therapy (of whom 44 were AML patients, 28 ALL patients). The results were compared with those from 58 control group matched for age and gender. There were no significant differences in conventional biventricular systolic function parameters between AL patients and controls. The left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS) were significantly lower in AL patients (-23.0 ± 1.4% vs. -24.1 ± 1.3% and -27.9 ± 7.1% vs. -33.0 ± 4.6%, respectively, Our findings suggest that baseline myocardial systolic function is lower in AL patients than controls. AML patients had lower baseline LVGLS and RVFWLS than controls and ALL patients. The decreased LVGLS is correlated with LVEF and the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes.",0
"The effects of microwave cooking and other traditional cooking methods such as boiling and autoclaving on the nutritional composition and anti-nutritional factors of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) were studied. Cooking treatments caused significant (P<0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions (reducing sugars, sucrose, raffinose and stachyose, while verbascose was completely eliminated after cooking treatments), antinutritional factors (trypsin inhibitor, haemagglutinin activity, tannins, saponins and phytic acid), minerals and B-vitamins. Cooking treatments decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, cooked chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. In-vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid index were improved by all cooking treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino acid of chickpeas subjected to the various cooking treatments varied considerably, depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking is recommended for chickpea preparation, not only for improving nutritional quality (by reducing the level of antinutritional and flatulence factors as well as increasing in-vitro protein digestibility and retention rates of both B-vitamins and minerals), but also for reducing cooking time.",1
"The ETV6RUNX1 fusion is the most common genetic abnormality in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), yet nearly 50 % of relapses occur in patients initially classified as low-risk with this alteration. This study aimed to unravel the underlying pathways driving relapse in ETV6RUNX1 positive B-ALL. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on a cohort of four B-ALL patients with the ETV6RUNX1 fusion (three newly diagnosed and one relapsed case, selected from 25 patients). we discovered that relapsed samples exhibited a decline in T cell populations, an increase in CD8 Tex cells and B cells, and a higher proportion of malignant cells. Gene enrichment analysis demonstrated that IFN-γ response signaling pathways and inflammatory responses were significantly enriched in newly diagnosed samples. Conversely, the relapsed samples showed enrichment in the oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis pathways. Additionally, analysis of cellular interactions revealed that malignant B cells could interact with T cells through LGALS9-HAVCR2, potentially leading to the exhaustion of effector T cells. Moreover, NPDC1, LEF1, and ERG exhibited higher activity levels in malignant B cells from relapsed patients, highlighting their roles in the progression and maintenance of leukemia. In summary, our study provides valuable insights into the potential causes of relapse in B-ALL patients with ETV6RUNX1, providing a foundation for the identification of prospective therapeutic targets.",0
"Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD are below 5%).",1
"This study was undertaken to determine the amount of ellagic acid, a naturally occurring inhibitor of carcinogenesis, in various fruits and nuts. Ellagic acid was extracted from freeze-dried berries, pears, peaches, plums, grapes, apples, kiwi, and several nuts using either acetone/water or methanol. The extracts were treated with trifluoroacetic acid to hydrolyze the ellagic acid glucosides, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both acetone/water and continuous soxhlet extraction with methanol were equally effective in extracting ellagic acid from strawberries. In raspberries, the amount of ellagic acid liberated by the two extraction methods was not significantly different after hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic acid. The extracts were stable over 90 days at −20, 4, and 25°C. Analysis showed that every food sample tested contained ellagic acid, but only the amounts present in strawberries (630 μg), raspberries (1500 μg), blackberries (1500 μg), walnuts (590 μg), pecans (330 μg), and cranberries (120 μg ellagic acid/g dry wt) were within the calibration range of the assay. In strawberries, 95.7% of the ellagic acid was found in the pulp while 4.3% was contained in the seeds. The seeds of raspberries contained 87.8% of the ellagic acid, and 12.2% was present in the pulp. The juice of both fruits contained negligible amounts of ellagic acid.",1
"The COVID-19 vaccine is indicated for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), yet patients and caregivers may have unique questions and concerns about vaccination. We surveyed children with ALL or their caregivers (N = 44) to understand factors contributing to the decision to vaccinate and identify cues to vaccination tailored to this population. For caregivers of unvaccinated ALL patients, lack of knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy were the most reported barriers to vaccination. A recommendation from a hematologist/oncologist and vaccine safety and efficacy data in children with ALL were the most cited cues to vaccination.",0
"To compare the efficacy and safety of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) and rhG-CSF in the recovery of neutrophils after induction therapy in ALL patients, PEG-rhG-CSF was injected subcutaneously within 24 ~ 48 h after the end of intravenous infusion of daunorubicin/idarubicin during induction chemotherapy. In rhG-CSF group, patients were given rhG-CSF. The main outcome indexes were the incidence and duration of grade 4 chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia (CIN, ANC less than 0.5 × 10",0
"CAR-T cell therapy has led to remarkable advances in the outcomes of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), B cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. Given these successes in hematologic malignancies, extensive efforts are now focused on developing CAR-T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors. The treatment of solid tumors poses significant hurdles with cell trafficking that is necessary to achieve efficacy and minimize off-tumor side effects. The development of simple, safe and inexpensive modalities to track CAR-T cell distribution in humans could provide critical insights to facilitate the development of improved CAR-T products for solid tumors. Here we demonstrate a strategy to monitor CAR-T cells",0
"Several phenolic acids, e.g. caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and ellagic acid, which occur naturally, are inhibitors of carcinogenesis. In this paper we present a new method for the simultaneous determination of all of these compounds, except ellagic acid, in juices by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet detection and involving isocratic elution, and we have devised an HPLC method for the determination of ellagic acid in juices. The experimental results showed that cherry juice contains a high concentration of chlorogenic acid and the content of bound gallic acid in black and green grape juices is high compared to that of other phenolic acids.",1
"Despite being a high-income country with universal health insurance coverage, disparities persist for LGBTIQ + people's mental health, substance use, sexual health, and physical health in Switzerland. Less research attention and public health efforts have focused on their palliative and end-of-life care (PEOLC) needs. This scoping review's objective is to explore, describe, and map the evidence related to PEOLC contexts for LGBTIQ + people in Switzerland. We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology for scoping reviews and adhered to PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Inclusion criteria were defined using the Population-Concept-Context framework. We systematically searched peer-reviewed and grey literature published in English, German, French, and Italian in databases including APA PsychInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, Google Scholar, Medline Ovid ALL, ProQuest, Web of Science, and various Swiss institutional repositories. Screening and data extraction were facilitated using Covidence, with titles and abstracts independently reviewed by at least two authors. Extracted data were organized to identify themes regarding patients' (anticipated) PEOLC needs, social support networks, healthcare professional (HCP) competencies, and existing initiatives or policies in Switzerland. Our search yielded 454 potential references, from which 35 were included after screening and eligibility assessments. The majority (n = 32, 91.4%) were grey literature sources, reflecting limited peer-reviewed empirical research. Nine references presented empirically collected data directly related to LGBTIQ + populations and their social support or HCP experiences in ageing, palliative, or end-of-life contexts. Findings highlighted significant health disparities, elevated chronic disease prevalence, and persistent fears of discrimination among ageing LGBTIQ + people, negatively impacting healthcare access and engagement. Social networks primarily composed of chosen families underscored vulnerabilities related to informal caregiving and decision-making in PEOLC contexts. HCPs were generally reported as lacking sufficient competencies and preparedness for providing culturally sensitive and inclusive care. Initiatives designed to promote awareness-building and inclusion remain fragmented, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts to address gaps in care provision for LGBTIQ + people in Switzerland. A stronger empirical basis is needed to effectively respond to PEOLC needs for LGBTIQ + people in Switzerland. Collaborative research efforts will lay the groundwork to build trust and capacity between people, communities, and healthcare professionals.",0
"The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of free flavonols.",1
"Blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin have demonstrated efficacy in treating relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and improving outcomes compared with conventional chemotherapy. Encouraging results have been observed in both younger and older patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive and Ph-negative B-ALL treated with these immunotherapy agents across several clinical trials. Treatment with inotuzumab ozogamicin and/or blinatumomab leads to high rates of deep measurable residual disease negativity and may enhance survival compared with chemotherapy-only approaches, reducing the need for intensive chemotherapy, and potentially the need for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Herein, we review the incorporation of blinatumomab and/or inotuzumab ozogamicin into frontline B-ALL regimens, including the potential use of chemotherapy-free approaches in select patient subgroups. We also explore the potential role of CAR T-cell therapies in the frontline setting for high-risk patients, as well as novel strategies to further improve outcomes in patients with B-ALL.",0
"Data on outcome for patients in different body mass index (BMI) categories in young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are scarce. We explored survival and toxicities in different BMI categories in young adults with ALL. Patients aged 18-45 years, diagnosed with ALL between July 2008 and June 2022 in the Nordic countries, Estonia, or Lithuania, and treated according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol, were retrospectively enrolled and classified into different BMI categories. Endpoints were overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse as well as incidence rate ratio (IRR) of severe predefined toxic events, and treatment delays. The group comprised 416 patients, of whom 234 (56%) were stratified to non-high-risk (non-HR) treatment. In the non-HR group, patients with severe obesity, BMI ≥35 kg/m Severe obesity is associated with worse EFS in young adults treated according to the non-HR arms of the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. Poorer outcome is explained with a higher risk of relapse, possibly due to under treatment, and not caused by excess therapy-related mortality.",0
"An analytical evaluation of an HPLC method with diode array detection to separate and quantify polyphenolic compounds from pears has been made. The method was applied to the quantitative analysis of phenolics from five pear horticultural cultivars ('Agua', 'Blanquilla', 'Conference', 'Pasagrana' and' Decana') in both peel and pulp matrices and evaluated for precision and accuracy. Precision was taken as the reproducibility in peak area of the polyphenols of interest as well as in the slope of calibration graphs. Values ranged 2–5%. Accuracy was evaluated by recovery of all polyphenolic compounds from both peel and pulp in all pears investigated. Accuracy values ranged 92–102%, and were independent of the polyphenolic structure, horticultural cultivar and matrix. Identification was by comparing retention times and UV spectra with those of standards when commercially available. When not available commercially, provisional identification was according to spectral characteristics as well as from isolation and hydrolysis data. Application of the method revealed differences between peel and pulp in all cases studied; the higher levels of phenolics were found in the peels. 'Decana' and 'Pasagrana' cultivars showed the highest phenolic content compounds whereas 'Conference' showed the lowest.",1
"To explore the clinical characteristics, molecular characteristics, treatment and prognosis of pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) with a therapeutic target. A total of 27 patients of Ph-like ALL with targeted drug target were initially diagnosed in Children's Hospital of Soochow University from December 2017 to June 2021. The data of age, gender, white blood cell (WBC) count at initial diagnosis, genetic characteristics, molecular biological changes, chemotherapy regimen, different targeted drugs were given, and minimal residual disease (MRD) on day 19, MRD on day 46, whether hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were retrospective analyed, and the clinical characteristics and treatment effect were summarized. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method. The intensity of chemotherapy was adjusted according to the MRD level during induced remission therapy in 27 patients, 10 patients were treated with targeted drugs during treatment, and 3 patients were bridged with HSCT, 1 patient died and 2 patients survived. Among the 24 patients who did not receive HSCT, 1 patient developed relapse, and achieved complete remission (CR) after treatment with chimeric antigen receptors T cells (CAR-T). The 3-year overall survival, 3-year relapse-free survival and 3-year event-free survival rate of 27 patients were (95.5±4.4)%, (95.0±4.9)% and (90.7±6.3)% respectively. Risk stratification chemotherapy based on MRD monitoring can improve the prognosis of Ph-like ALL in children, combined with targeted drugs can achieve complete remission as soon as possible in children whose chemotherapy response is poor, and sequential CAR-T and HSCT can significantly improve the therapeutic effect of Ph-like ALL in children whose MRD is continuously positive during induced remission therapy. 儿童费城染色体样急性淋巴细胞白血病的临床分析. 探讨具有治疗靶点的儿童费城染色体样急性淋巴细胞白血病（Ph-like ALL）的临床特点、分子学特征、治疗及预后。. 2017年12月至2021年6月在苏州大学附属儿童医院初诊且具备靶向药物治疗靶点的儿童Ph-like ALL共27例，回顾性分析患儿年龄、性别、初诊时白细胞计数、遗传学特征、分子生物学改变、化疗方案、给予不同靶向药物、d 19微小残留病（MRD）、d 46 MRD、是否行造血干细胞移植（HSCT）等资料，归纳总结患儿的临床特征及治疗效果。采用Kaplan-Meier方法进行生存分析。. 27例患儿均根据诱导缓解治疗过程中MRD水平调整化疗强度，10例在治疗过程中加用靶向药，3例患儿桥接HSCT，其中1例死亡，2例存活。24例未行HSCT患儿中，1例患儿出现复发，采用嵌合抗原受体T细胞（CAR-T）治疗后达完全缓解（CR）。27例患儿3年总生存率为（95.5±4.4）%，3年无复发生存率为（95.0±4.9）%，3年无事件生存率为（90.7±6.3）%。. 基于MRD监测的危险度分层化疗可改善Ph-like ALL患儿预后，对化疗效果欠佳的患儿联合靶向药可尽快完全缓解，诱导缓解治疗过程中MRD持续阳性的Ph-like ALL患儿序贯CAR-T和HSCT能显著提高治疗效果。.",0
"A recent single-center study reported a significant increase in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases, including mixed-phenotype acute leukaemia (MPAL), after exposure to direct acting agents (DAA). We investigated whether DAA use increased the risk of AML in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We conducted a disproportionality analysis of the WHO Pharmacovigilance database Vigibase up to 2020. Queries focused on all DAAs, subclasses, combinations or each DAA separately as well as interferon and ribavirin as negative controls. The primary outcome was AML. Secondary outcomes were AML without MPAL, MPAL, acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and acute leukemia (AL, high-level term encompassing AML, ALL, MPAL and unspecified acute leukemia [UAL]). The information component (IC0.25) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR0.25) were computed to assess a potential pharmacovigilance signal. We identified 49 notifications reporting any AL occurrence after anti-HCV treatments from June 1997 to December 2020: 23 (47%) involved a DAA, 24 (49%) interferon and 12 (24%) ribavirin. The DAAs sofosbuvir and ledipasvir were suspected in 74% (n = 17) and 39% (n = 9) of cases. The events reported were AML (n = 22), ALL (n = 11), AML and ALL (n = 1) and UAL (n = 15) and no MPAL. DAA, interferon or ribavirin were not significantly associated with AML, ALL or AL. This study did not find any association between DAA exposure and the occurrence of AML. Nevertheless, vigilance should remain, particularly for MPAL, which may not have been well captured in our study because of its rareness and high risk of misclassification.",0
"The concentrations of the five main catechins (flavanols), epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin, catechin and four main theaflavins, theaflavin, theaflavin-3′-gallate, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3,3′-digallate in black tea brew and their effects on astringency were investigated. The catechins and theaflavins were assayed by HPLC. Astringency, which was scaled from 1 to 9, was estimated by a trained panel. The correlations between astringency and content of total catechins and individual catechins, except catechin itself, were significant, whereas no correlation between theaflavins and astringency was observed.",1
"The objective of this study is to assess the expression levels of different immaturity CD markers in diverse subtypes of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) among children and adults, and determine any statistically significant variations in marker expression between these two groups. This dataset included CD marker expressions (CD34, HLA-DR, TdT, and CD38) for 130 ALL patients (51 pediatric B-ALL, 16 pediatric T-ALL, 44 adult B-ALL, and 19 adult T-ALL patients). The Shapiro-Wilk test analysis was conducted to check for normality distribution in all data points before proceeding with the statistical analysis test. As a result for each marker within these subtypes, descriptive statistics were calculated. Independent samples t-tests were initially conducted to compare mean expression levels of CD markers between groups. Moreover, since non-normal distributions are likely to occur, Mann-Whitney U tests were used for Pediatric T-ALL and Adult T-ALL. Descriptive analysis indicated variability in CD marker expression levels among the different subtypes of ALL. Both t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in the expression levels of CD markers between pediatric and adult groups, or between B-ALL and T-ALL groups. Significant differences have been identified using different analysis methods across the studied groups. The investigation analyzes the expression levels of CD34, HLA-DR CD38, and TdT within pediatric B-ALL patients and pediatric T-ALL patients along with adult B-ALL patients and adult T-ALL patients. The patterns need appreciation because they might reveal biological differences at their base which influence disease development and both treatment results and patient survival outcomes.",0
"To clarify how structural diversity of anthocyanins relates to their in vivo function, bioavailability was precisely studied in rats using bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract (Bilberon 25) as an anthocyanin source that contains 15 different anthocyanins. The bilberry extract was orally or intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside were detectable in the blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the maximum level of 1.2 microM at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg bilberry extract (153.2 mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous administration were only 30.8 and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma. The major anthocyanins distributed in liver and kidney were the O-methyl anthocyanins such as peonidin, malvidin, and other O-methyl anthocyanins derived from delphinidin, cyanidin, and petunidin-glycosides.",1

"Changes occurring in the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, and complex phenols linked to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (fractions FII and FIV) and p-hydroxyphenylethanol (FIII) during storage of virgin olive oil under environmental conditions were studied. Under diffused light, alpha-tocopherol was decomposed by 79% in 4 months, whereas <45% of the phenols were lost during the same period. Among the phenols, FII showed the least stability, and decreased by 72% in 6 months. Total phenols, FIII, and FIV recorded reductions in the range of 57-63% in 6 months. When the oil was stored in the dark, alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, FIII, and FIV exhibited similar profiles of degradation, reducing by 39-45% in the first 6 months and 50-62% in 12 months. FII was the least stable compound in the dark and recorded a loss of 64% in 6 months and 79% in 12 months. The levels of the above antioxidants were further related to peroxide formation. Remaining levels of these compounds at PV = 20 meq/kg ranged between 50 and 73% under diffused light and between 40 and 62% in the dark.",1
"Treatment of relapsed/refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a challenge, particularly in patients who do not respond to traditional chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of fedratinib, a semi selective JAK2 inhibitor and venetoclax, a selective BCL-2 inhibitor, on human B-ALL using both single-agent and combinatorial treatments. The combination treatment of fedratinib and venetoclax improved killing of the human B-ALL cell lines RS4;11 and SUPB-15 in vitro over single-agent treatments. This combinatorial effect was not detected in the human B-ALL cell line NALM-6, which was less responsive to fedratinib due to the absence of Flt3 expression. The combination treatment induces a unique gene expression profile relative to single-agent treatment and with an enrichment in apoptotic pathways. Finally, the combination treatment was superior to single agent treatment in an in vivo xenograft model of human B-ALL, with a two-week treatment regimen significantly improving overall survival while inducing CD19 expression. Overall, our data demonstrates the efficacy of a combinatorial treatment strategy of fedratinib and venetoclax against human B-ALL expressing high levels of Flt3.",0
"T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is a rare and aggressive subtype of precursor T-cell lymphomas, often presenting with lymph node, bone marrow, and mediastinal involvement. Cutaneous involvement is uncommon but associated with a poor prognosis. We report the case of a 17-year-old female with relapsed T-LBL presenting with bilateral breast masses, confirmed by biopsy and immunohistochemistry. Initial treatment with a BFM ALL chemotherapy protocol resulted in partial response, but disease recurrence with cutaneous and cervical lymph node involvement necessitated further treatment with the ALLIC BFM 2016 Relapse protocol. The disease course was complicated by avascular necrosis requiring hip arthroplasty, and follow-up PET/CT scans revealed further extranodal involvement, including the skin. Extranodal involvement in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), such as T-LBL, poses significant challenges to clinical management due to its association with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Standard CHOP regimens often result in short-term remission with high relapse rates. Emerging therapies, including HDAC inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, and immunotherapies, show promise but require further study to address tumor heterogeneity and optimize efficacy. This case underscores the critical role of early diagnosis and effective multidisciplinary management in relapsed T-LBL with skin involvement. Further research is needed to develop personalized therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes in this rare and aggressive lymphoma subtype.",0
"Reverse phase HPLC has been applied to quantify levels of polymethoxylated flavones and carotenoids in orange and tangelo juices. Lower levels of sinensetin and tetramethyl-o-scutellarein and higher levels of heptamethoxyflavone and tangeretin relative to nobiletin indicated the addition of tangelo to orange juice. β-Cryptoxanthin and its esters, identified by positive ion electrospray mass spectrometry, were present in larger amounts relative to β-carotene in tangelo than in orange juice. Using canonical discriminant analysis, the addition of 100 g kg−1 tangelo to orange juice can be detected.",1
"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Current core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers, widely employed for diagnosis, require a lumbar puncture to be performed, making them impractical as screening tools. Considering the role of sleep disturbances in AD, recent research suggests quantitative sleep electroencephalography features as potential non-invasive biomarkers of AD pathology. However, quantitative analysis of comprehensive polysomnography (PSG) signals remains relatively understudied. PSG is a non-invasive test enabling qualitative and quantitative analysis of a wide range of parameters, offering additional insights alongside other biomarkers. Machine Learning (ML) gained interest for its ability to discern intricate patterns within complex datasets, offering promise in AD neuropathology detection. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal ML approach in predicting core AD CSF biomarkers. Mild-moderate AD patients were prospectively recruited for PSG, followed by testing of CSF and blood samples for biomarkers. PSG signals underwent preprocessing to extract non-linear, time domain and frequency domain statistics quantitative features. Multiple ML algorithms were trained using four subsets of input features: clinical variables (CLINVAR), conventional PSG parameters (SLEEPVAR), quantitative PSG signal features (PSGVAR) and a combination of all subsets (ALL). Cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate model performance and ensure generalizability. Regression models were developed to determine the most effective variable combinations for explaining variance in the biomarkers. On 49 subjects, Gradient Boosting Regressors achieved the best results in estimating biomarkers levels, using different loss functions for each biomarker: least absolute deviation (LAD) for the A Multimodal ML can help predict the outcome of CSF biomarkers in early AD by utilizing non-invasive and economically feasible variables. The integration of computational models into medical practice offers a promising tool for the screening of patients at risk of AD, potentially guiding clinical decisions.",0

"Cuplike Nuclei(CLN) cells, particularly rare in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(ALL), have been documented in only few cases to date. A recent study has revealed a correlation between CLN and IKZF1 deletions in pediatric B-ALL. This study introduces a case of CLN in adult B-ALL with a translocation (4;11)(q21;q23), while discussing the current relevant literature on the subject. Through this examination, several unique characteristics of CLN cells in both ALL and Acute Myeloid Leukemia are highlighted. It is essential to accumulate further data to confirm these distinctive traits, and investigate the potential association between CLN and cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities.",0
" This study was undertaken to determine whether it is possible to distinguish organic wines from normal wines on the basis of chemical composition and spectral data. A total of 58 wine samples including organic and normal red and white wines from France and Germany were analysed. The concentrations of several phenolic compounds, including trans-resveratrol, were determined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with both diode array and coulometric electrode array detection. In addition, total phenols, total acids, pH and SO2 were determined. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of wines were measured, and the absorbances at four different wavelengths were determined. The data were processed statistically using principal component analysis (PCA). Despite several different combinations of variables, separation of white wines was only achieved according to geographical origin. PCA differentiated well between organic Burgundy red wines and normal Burgundy wines. The separation was based on the concentrations of caffeic and gallic acids, total phenol content and the absorbance ratios A254/A276, A276/A320 and A320/A520. PCA was unable to differentiate organic white wines from corresponding normal wines. The mean trans-resveratrol concentrations of 16 organic red wines and 16 normal red wines were 5.6 mg/l and 2.9 mg/l, respectively. The highest concentration, 14,5 mg/l, was found in an organic red wine from the Loire district in France.",1
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by the aberrant accumulation of immature and dysfunctional B cells in bone marrow (BM). Although chemotherapy and other therapies have been widely applied, some patients such as relapsed or drug-refractory (R/R) B-ALL patients exhibit limited response. YT521-B homologous domain-containing protein 1 (YTHDC1) is a nuclear reader of N",0
"High-risk relapsed/refractory adult Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a great challenge due to limited possibilities to achieve and maintain a complete response. This also applies to cases with extramedullary (EM) involvement that have poor outcomes and no accepted standard therapeutic approaches. The incidence of EM localization in relapsed/refractory B-ALL is poorly investigated: data on patients treated with blinatumomab reported a 40% rate. Some responses were reported in EM patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin or CAR-T. However, molecular mechanisms of response or refractoriness are usually investigated neither at the medullary nor at EM sites. In the complex scenario of pluri-relapsed/refractory B-ALL patients, new target therapies are needed. Our analysis started with the case of an adult pluri-relapsed Ph- B-ALL patient, poorly sensitive to inotuzumab ozogamicin, donor lymphocyte infusions, and blinatumomab in EM disease, who achieved a durable/complete response after treatment with the BCL2-inhibitor venetoclax. The molecular characterization of medullary and EM samples revealed a tyrosine kinase domain",0
"The health benefit of fruit juices have been ascribed, in part, to phenolic antioxidants. The antioxidant potential of a range of fruit juices was assessed by measurement of their ability to reduce a synthetic free radical, potassium nitrosodisulphonate, and also by their ability to reduce Fe(III). Vitamin C was found to account for 65–100% of the antioxidant potential of beverages derived from citrus fruit but less than 5% of apple and pineapple juice. The contribution of carotenoids to antioxidant potential was negligible. Although phenolics appear to be major contributors to the antioxidant potential of the non-citrus juices, their identity and bio-availability requires further investigation.",1
"Blinatumomab is a CD3 × CD19 antibody approved for adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Blinatumomab is not considered myelosuppressive, but significant neutropenia has been seen in practice. We reviewed 95 patients with B-ALL who received blinatumomab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between 2015 and 2024. Of these, 71 patients were treated in morphologic remission with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1 × 10",0
"The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.",1
"A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of anthocyanidins from berries and red wine is described. Delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and malvidin contents of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), black currant (Ribes nigrum), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa cv. Jonsok), and a Cabernet sauvignon (Vitis vinifera) red wine were determined. The aglycon forms of the anthocyanins present in the samples were revealed by acid hydrolysis. A reversed phase analytical column was employed to separate the anthocyanidins before identification by diode array detection. The suitability of the method was tested by determining the recovery (95-102% as aglycons and 69-104% from glycosides) for each anthocyanidin. Method repeatability was tested by charting the total aglycon content of two samples over a period of 14 analyses and determining the coefficients of variation (1.41% for bilberry and 2.56% for in-house reference material). The method developed proved thus to be effective for reliable determination of anthocyanidins from freeze-dried berry samples and red wine. The total anthocyanidin content of the tested samples was as follows: in-house reference material, 447 +/- 8 mg/100 g; strawberry, 23.8 +/- 0.4 mg/100 g; black currant, 135 +/- 3 mg/100 g; bilberry, 360 +/- 3 mg/100 g; and Cabernet sauvignon red wine, 26.1 +/- 0.1 mg/100 mL.",1
"A large number of plants, which have been used as food and herbs in Thailand, were investigated for their antioxidant activity by using a β-carotene bleaching method. The contents of plant chemicals, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, tannin, and total phenolics, were also determined. The results showed that the highest antioxidant activity was found in the plant Gymnema inodorum, followed by Piper sarmentosum and Mentha arvensis, respectively. G. inodorum also contained the highest amount of vitamin E, and M. arvensis contained the highest amount of total xanthophylls. Correlations between the chemical content of each plant and the antioxidant index were observed. The results suggest that chemicals such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds are the contributors to the antioxidant activity in the plants.",1
"Despite progress in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the adverse effects of chemotherapy toxicity and iron overload from transfusions continue to affect patients' quality of life. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exhibit both antitumor and anti-inflammatory properties in leukemia. This study investigated the influence of n-3 PUFA on the efficacy of cytarabine in cells with iron overload. Iron overload was induced in NALM-6 cells using ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) and quantified through atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The impact of n-3 PUFA on NALM-6 cells' response to cytarabine was evaluated using MTT, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), apoptosis, and cell cycle assays. Additionally, gene expression analyses were performed on apoptotic, anti-apoptotic, and inflammatory genes, along with oxidative stress markers such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The administration of n-3 PUFA significantly enhanced the effectiveness of cytarabine in iron-overloaded NALM-6 cells, leading to increased LDH secretion, elevated apoptosis rates, and G1 phase cell cycle arrest. These effects were associated with the upregulation of apoptotic genes such as P53 and caspase-8, the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2, and a decrease in the inflammatory gene TNF-α. Furthermore, there was a notable increase in ROS and MDA levels. Overall, n-3 PUFA treatment improved cytarabine's efficacy in iron-overloaded NALM-6 cells by activating apoptotic processes and oxidative stress pathways.",0
"Leukemia constitutes approximately one-third of all pediatric cancers, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprising roughly 80% of pediatric leukemia instances. This study sought to ascertain the prevalence of HLA A, B, DR, and DQ allele groups linked with pediatric acute leukemia. We recruited 70 Moroccan children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 39 of whom had BCP-ALL and were eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, compared to a control group of 136 healthy children. Patients and controls were subjected to HLA class I and II typing, utilizing either sequence-specific primers (SSPs) or sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSOs) in polymerase chain reaction-based techniques. The findings indicated significantly elevated frequencies of HLA-A*68 and B*14 in pediatric patients with ALL relative to the control group (",0
"Dietary phytoestrogens such as the isoflavones daidzein and genistein are thought to protect against chronic diseases that are common in Western societies, such as cancer, osteoporosis, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, there are concerns regarding the deleterious effects of hormone-like compounds, especially with respect to the development of infants. However, there is little information regarding the phytoestrogen content of foods, and therefore epidemiologic investigations of phytoestrogens are limited. As part of a study quantifying the consumption of phytoestrogens, the objective of this work was to assess the daidzein and genistein content of fruits and nuts commonly eaten in Europe. Eighty different fruits and nuts were sampled, prepared for eating, and freeze-dried. Daidzein and genistein were extracted from the dried foods, and the two isoflavones were quantified after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. Completeness of extraction and any procedural losses of the isoflavones were accounted for using synthetic daidzin (7-O-glucosyl-4'-hydroxyisoflavone) and genistin (7-O-glucosyl-4'5-dihydroxyisoflavone) as internal standards. Of the 80 foods assayed, 43 contained no detectable daidzein or genistein, at a limit of quantification of 1 microg/kg dry weight of food. Nine foods contained more than 100 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram wet weight, and 28 contained less than this amount. Currants and raisins were the richest sources of the isoflavones, containing 2,250 microg and 1,840 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram of wet weight of food. Although fruits and nuts are not as rich in isoflavone phytoestrogens as are soy and other legumes, this is the first documentation of levels of daidzein and genistein occurring in these foods.",1
"Despite the use of targeted therapeutic approaches, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is still associated with a high incidence of complications and a poor prognosis. Indisulam (also known as E7070), a newly identified molecular glue compound, has demonstrated increased therapeutic efficacy in several types of cancer through the rapid degradation of RBM39. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of indisulam in T-ALL, elucidate its underlying mechanisms and explore the role of the RBM39 gene. We verified the anticancer effects of indisulam in both in vivo and in vitro models. Additionally, the construction of RBM39-knockdown cell lines using shRNA confirmed that the malignant phenotype of T-ALL cells was dependent on RBM39. Through RNA sequencing, we identified indisulam-induced splicing anomalies, and proteomic analysis helped pinpoint protein changes caused by the drug. Comprehensive cross-analysis of these findings facilitated the identification of downstream effectors and subsequent validation of their functional roles. Indisulam has significant antineoplastic effects on T-ALL. It attenuates cell proliferation, promotes apoptosis and interferes with cell cycle progression in vitro while facilitating tumor remission in T-ALL in vivo models. This investigation provides evidence that the downregulation of RBM39 results in the restricted proliferation of T-ALL cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RBM39 is a potential target for T-ALL treatment. Indisulam's efficacy is attributed to its ability to induce RBM39 degradation, causing widespread aberrant splicing and abnormal translation of the critical downstream effector protein, THOC1, ultimately leading to protein depletion. Moreover, the presence of DCAF15 is regarded as critical for the effectiveness of indisulam, and its absence negates the ability of indisulam to induce the desired functional alterations. Our study revealed that indisulam, which targets RBM39 to induce tumor cell apoptosis, is an effective drug for treating T-ALL. Targeting RBM39 through indisulam leads to mis-splicing of pre-mRNAs, resulting in the loss of key effectors such as THOC1.",0
"Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids (FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde (3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil extraction.",1
"Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that may possess chronic disease preventive properties. Here, rapid, reliable, and reproducible solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry techniques are described for the isolation, separation, and identification of anthocyanins in human plasma and urine. Recoveries of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were 91% from water, 71% from plasma, and 81% from urine. Intra- and interday variations for C3G extraction were 9 and 9.1% in plasma and 7.1 and 9.1% in urine and were less than 15% for all anthocyanins from a standardized bilberry extract (mirtoselect). Analysis of mirtoselect by HPLC with UV detection produced spectra with 15 peaks compatible with anthocyanin components found in mirtoselect within a total run time of 15 min. Chromatographic analysis of human urine obtained after an oral dose of mirtoselect yielded 19 anthocyanin peaks. Mass spectrometric analysis employing multiple reaction monitoring suggests the presence of unchanged anthocyanins and anthocyanidin glucuronide metabolites.",1
"Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (pfCD) is a severe type of inflammatory bowel disease resulting in significant patient morbidity. Despite advancements in treatments, pfCD remains challenging to manage with low healing rates. Fecal diversion (FD) has previously demonstrated clinical improvement for patients with refractory disease. Our meta-analysis aimed to explore the clinical response to FD, rates of successful restoration of bowel continuity after FD, rates of re-diversion, and factors affecting the success of FD in pfCD. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out of adult patients who had undergone FD for pfCD, with detailed patient outcome data. Studies were identified through a literature search of six bibliographic databases and one trial register, all run on February 28, 2025, including MEDLINE ALL, EMBASE, Emcare, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Seventeen studies encompassing 714 adult pfCD patients were included. FD resulted in a 65% clinical improvement rate, yet considerable heterogeneity existed in study methodologies and outcome definitions. While 29% of patients achieved bowel restoration within a median follow-up of 58.2 months, challenges in sustaining the effects were evident, with 10% requiring repeat diversion and a 37% overall proctectomy/proctocolectomy rate. Factors associated with diversion success included the absence of rectal involvement and quiescent luminal disease, with biologic use showing no impact on outcomes. FD offers symptom control in pfCD, although restoration rates remain low. These findings emphasize the need for individualized patient counseling. Future research should strive for uniform measures and refined approaches to enhance pfCD management.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a malignant hematological disease with limited targeted therapy options. Overexpression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11B is frequently observed in T-ALL and contributes to leukemogenesis. Knockdown of BCL11B inhibits T-ALL cell proliferation and induces apoptosis, making it a potential therapeutic target. However, the clinical application of siRNA therapies is hindered by challenges such as poor delivery efficiency and limited clinical outcomes. We developed a targeted delivery system for BCL11B siRNA (siBCL11B) using generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5-PAMAM) dendrimers conjugated with the sgc8 aptamer, which specifically binds to the T-ALL cell membrane protein PTK7. This nanoparticle, designated G5-sgc8-siBCL11B, was designed to selectively deliver siRNA to T-ALL cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy and safety. We demonstrate that sgc8-conjugated siBCL11B nanoparticles selectively and efficiently target BCL11B-overexpressing T-ALL cells, significantly inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis while exhibiting minimal impact on the viability of normal T cells. In T-ALL mouse model studies, G5-sgc8-siBCL11B and G5-siBCL11B significantly inhibited the progression of T-ALL in vivo, extending the survival of mice compared to the control (CTR), G5, and G5-sgc8 groups. Although there was no significant difference in survival between the G5-sgc8-siBCL11B and G5-siBCL11B groups, a trend towards improved survival was observed (p = 0.0993). The G5-sgc8-siBCL11B nanoparticle system demonstrated efficient delivery and significant therapeutic efficacy, highlighting its potential as a promising novel approach for the treatment of T-ALL.",0
"The antioxidant dihydrocaffeic acid is a dietary constituent and a microbial metabolite of flavonoids. Orally administered to rats, dihydrocaffeic acid was very rapidly absorbed most probably by the gastric or duodenal epithelium and excreted in urine as free and conjugated forms. LC-MS2 analysis of plasma and urine samples allowed confident identification of the dihydrocaffeic acid metabolites. The parent compound was glucuronidated, sulphated or methylated, on one of the hydroxyl groups present on its phenyl ring. All the dihydrocaffeic acid metabolites peaked in plasma within the first 30min following ingestion, suggesting a metabolism possibly by the gastric or duodenal cells and by the liver. Using in vitro and ex vivo models of the intestinal epithelium and the liver, the identity and source of the metabolites detected in vivo were examined. The data obtained suggest that, in rats, intestinal cells are more able to glucuronidate dihydrocaffeic acid, whereas liver favours sulphation. Moreover, glucuronidation, sulphation and methylation seem to be regio-selective, preferably on the 3-OH of dihydrocaffeic acid. The methyl conjugate, dihydroferulic acid, was shown to be oxidized into ferulic acid by intestinal and hepatic cells, which were also able to perform the reverse reaction, the reduction of ferulic acid into dihydroferulic acid. As a conclusion, the main form of dihydrocaffeic acid circulating in plasma after its ingestion is a mixture of different primary and secondary metabolites.",1
"Few studies have addressed the role of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) and non-myeloablative (NMA) regimens in older adults with Philadelphia acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL). The objective of this current study was to compare the outcomes of RIC/NMA versus TBI-based myeloablative (MAC) regimens in Ph + ALL patients older than 40 years old who underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in CR1. We used a freely available database from the CIBMTR. Transplants were performed between 2013 and 2017. With a median follow-up of 37.6 months, we have included 629 patients. We used propensity score weighting. Three-year OSs were 64% in the TBI-MAC group and 66% in the RIC/NMA group. OS was not different (HR = 0.92; p = 0.69). Three-year relapse incidences were 21.6% and 27.6% in the TBI-MAC and RIC/NMA groups. RIC/NMA was not associated with an increase in relapse rate (HR 1.02; p = 0.91). Three-year NRMs were 24.3% in the TBI-MAC group and 20.3% in the RIC/NMA group. RIC/NMA was not associated with superior NRM (HR 0.88; p = 0.57). In summary, we have shown that RIC/NMA regimens achieve outcomes comparable to TBI-based MAC in Ph+ ALL older patients in CR1 who may tolerate a TBI-based MAC regimen.",0
"We measured minimal residual disease (MRD) by multiparameter flow cytometry at three time points (TP) in 117 infants with KMT2A (lysine [K]-specific methyltransferase 2A)-rearranged and 58 with KMT2A-germline acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on Children's Oncology Group AALL0631 study. For KMT2A-rearranged patients, 3-year event-free survival (EFS) by MRD-positive (≥0.01%) versus MRD-negative (<0.01%) was: TP1: 25% (±6%) versus 49% (±7%; p = .0009); TP2: 21% (±8%) versus 47% (±7%; p < .0001); and TP3: 22% (±14%) versus 51% (±6%; p = .0178). For KMT2A-germline patients, 3-year EFS was: TP1: 88% (±12%) versus 87% (±5%; p = .73); TP2: 100% versus 88% (±5%; p = .24); and TP3: 100% versus 87% (±5%; p = .53). MRD was a strong independent outcome predictor in KMT2A-rearranged, but not KMT2A-germline infant ALL.",0
"A method was developed for the quantification of the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol in human urine using a solid-phase extraction procedure followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Deuterated internal standards of the analytes were spiked into the samples prior to extraction. The limit of detection of the method was ca. 10 pg on column and precision of the method for quantification in a sample of urine was +/-9.40% for kaempferol and +/-7.34% for quercetin (n = 6). The levels of quercetin and kaempferol found in urine samples were only a small fraction of the amount ingested. The treatment of urine samples with beta-glucuronidase markedly increased the levels of flavonoids detected, supporting the view that kaempferol and quercetin are eliminated in the urine as glucuronides.",1
"The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.",1
"Advances in research, including novel biomarker identification and patient stratification, have significantly improved the therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), though access to improved healthcare services varies across geographical regions. In an effort to evaluate the advances in therapeutic approaches, we performed a retrospective analysis of childhood ALL in Kosovo. Our retrospective analysis included 225 cases diagnosed between 2008 and 2023, representing 52% of 429 diagnosed childhood cancers. The average annual incidence was 14, with a median age diagnosis of seven years, and a male predominance (59.54%). Patients were categorized into risk groups, with the majority (43%) in the standard-risk category. We identified five different treatment protocols for this study period. Over 61% of patients achieved remission after the first chemotherapy cycle and we observed a 20% mortality rate. Survival analysis showed that 55% and 40% of patients achieved 2-year and 5-year event-free survival (EFS), respectively, with significant differences across risk groups. Treatment advancements significantly correlated with improved survival rates, achieving a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 88% in the currently used standardized AIEOP-BFM-2009 protocol. Our study emphasizes the need for continued research and customized care strategies to enhance clinical outcomes.",0
"Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while (epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of (epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.",1
"Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of 11 cultivars of fresh plums were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Identification and quantification of individual polyphenolics were performed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. The total phenolic contents of various cultivars widely varied from 125.0 to 372.6 mg/100 g expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The level of total flavonoids in fresh plums ranged between 64.8 and 257.5 mg/100 g expressed as catechin equivalents. Antioxidant capacity, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), ranged from 204.9 to 567.0 mg/100 g with an average of 290.9 mg/100 g of fresh weight. Cv. Beltsville Elite B70197 showed the highest amounts of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the highest VCEAC. A positive relationship (correlation coefficient r (2)() = 0.977) was presented between total phenolics and VCEAC, suggesting polyphenolics would play an important role in free radical scavenging. The level of IC(50) value of superoxide radical anion scavenging activity of the plum cultivars ranged from 13.4 to 45.7 mg of VCEAC/100 g. Neochlorogenic acid was the predominant polyphenolic among fresh plums tested. Flavonols found in plum were commonly quercetin derivatives. Rutin was the most predominant flavonol in plums. Various anthocyanins containing cyanidin aglycon and peonidin aglycon were commonly found in all plums except for cv. Mirabellier and NY 101.",1
"The total anthocyanin and total phenolic content of wild (samples from 4 populations) and cultivated (samples from 32 populations) Pacific Northwestern American Vaccinium species (V. membranaceum, V. ovalifolium, and V. deliciosum) were evaluated. The total monomeric anthocyanin content of all huckleberry samples analyzed ranged from 101 to 400 mg/100 g (expressed as cyanidin-3-glucoside), and the total phenolics varied from 367 to 1286 mg/100 g (expressed as gallic acid). Cluster analysis separated the samples into four different groups based on their anthocyanin and total phenolic content. Two groups had greater anthocyanin pigment and total phenolics; one consisted entirely of cultivated V. ovalifolium (LIG10, VAC485, VAC487, LIG33, LIG9, LIG2, and VAC349) and the other consisted of just cultivated V. membranaceum (LIG25). Significant variations in total anthocyanins, total phenolics, and the ratio of the total anthocyanins and total phenolics were observed among the different V. membranaceum, V. ovalifolium, and V. deliciosum populations cultivated in the Willamette Valley, Ore. The profile of the individual anthocyanins of the wild V. membranaceum, wild V. ovalifolium, and V. corymbosum ‘Rubel’ were conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography. The chromatograms of V. membranaceum, V. ovalifolium, and ‘Rubel’ were distinctly different in the amounts of delphinidin, cyanidin, and malvidin glycosides.",1
"The content of the potentially anticarcinogenic flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin, and luteolin of 28 vegetables and 9 fruits was determined by RP-HPLC with UV detection. Fresh foods were purchased in a supermarket a grocery, and a street market and combined to composites. Processed foods were purchased additionally. Sampling was carried out in spring, summer, winter, and spring of the following Year. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables were generally below 10 mg/kg except for onions (284-486 mg/kg), kale (110 mg/kg), broccoli (30 mg/kg), French beans (32-45 mg/kg), and slicing beans (28-30 mg/kg). Kaempferol could only be detected in kale (211 mg/kg), endive (15-91 mg/kg), leek (11-56 mg/kg), and turnip tops (31-64 mg/kg). In most fruits the quercetin content averaged 15 mg/kg, except for different apple varieties in which 21-72 mg/kg was found. The content of myricetin, luteolin, and apigenin was below the limit of detection (< 1 mg/kg) except for fresh broad beans (26 mg/kg myricetin) and red bell pepper (13-31 mg/kg luteolin). Seasonal variability was low for most vegetables except for leafy vegetables with highest flavonoid levels in summer. These collective data provide a base for an epidemiological evaluation of possible anticarcinogenic effects of flavonoids.",1

"To explore the prognostic effect of cytokine levels such as IL-6 (interleukin), IL-8 and TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-α on patients with sepsis in intensive care units (ICUs) by Meta-analysis. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and other databases up to May 2023 to retrieve clinical research articles on cytokine testing for predicting sepsis prognosis in ICU settings. Relevant indicators were extracted and recorded in Excel. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3. A total of 25 studies were finally included in this Meta-analysis: 21 investigated IL-6, 6 examined IL-8, 11 addressed IL-10, 12 reviewed TNF-α, and 6 focused on IL-1β. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α and IL-1β) in survival groups were substantially lower than those in non-survival groups (ALL P < 0.00001). Specific findings include significant differences in IL-6 [SMD = -25.32, 95% CI (-27.14, -23.49), P < 0.00001], IL-8 [SMD = -140.48, 95% CI (-154.32, -126.64), P < 0.00001], IL-10 [SMD = -54.10, 95% CI (-56.74, -51.47), P < 0.00001], TNF-α [SMD = -8.67, 95% CI (-9.82, -7.52), P < 0.00001], and IL-1β [SMD = -3.71, 95% CI (-4.11, -3.30), P < 0.00001]. The funnel plots for IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-1β displayed roughly symmetrical distributions, suggesting minimal bias and high reliability of the findings. Cytokine levels such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α are valuable prognostic indicators for patients with sepsis in the ICUs. Early testing of these cytokines can guide clinical interventions and enable targeted treatments for high-risk patients to reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes.",0
"Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin (1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation. Furthermore, a correlation between the total melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7309, p < 0.01) and inhibition of 8-OH-dG was observed.",1
"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are among the most common lesions in orthopaedics practice, but still today, rates up to 24% of unsatisfactory results are reported. Unaddressed anterolateral complex (ALC) injuries have been claimed to be responsible for residual anterolateral rotatory instability (ALRI) after isolate ACL reconstruction and have demonstrated to increase graft failure. In this article, we present our technique for reconstruction of the ACL and anterolateral (ALL) ligament combining the advantages of the anatomical position and the intraosseous femoral fixation to ensure anteroposterior and anterolateral rotational stability.",0
"The quality of 7 commercial apple juices, after 11 -mo storage, was assessed on the basis of polyphenol and vitamin C contents, and also on the Trolox® equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value. Phenolic acids, flavonoids, and vitamin C were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography. It was shown that the content of phenolic acids in juices varied up to 2-fold and flavonoids up to 4.5-fold. Moreover, storage of juices resulted in a decrease of phenolic acids (5% to 21%), flavonoids (8% to 19%), and also of TEAC values (6% to 14%). Significant correlations between polyphenol content and TEAC values for fresh, stored, and all juices (fresh plus stored) and no correlation for vitamin C indicate that the TEAC value of apple juices depends mainly on their polyphenol content. Based on these results, it is concluded that the TEAC value, directly reflecting polyphenol content, may serve as a useful parameter to assess the quality of apple juice at any stage of its shelf life.",1
"An HPLC method has been developed which allowed the determination of mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acids (CQA and di-CQA), corresponding lactones (CQL) and feruloylquinic acids (FQA) in roasted coffee within one chromatographic run. The elution order was verified by isolation of the individual compounds by preparative HPLC, chromatography of the fractions on the analytical HPLC system, NMR spectroscopy and thermospray LC-MS. At least 15 additional minor compounds had the spectra of hydroxycinnamic acids, some of them only occurring in roasted coffee. Caffeoyltryptophan, which has been identified some time ago by another working group could also be separated with this system. The average contents in commercial roasted coffee samples (n=12) were: 3-CQA, 5·0 g kg−1; 4-CQA, 6·2 g kg−1; 5-CQA, 11·4 g kg−1; 4-FQA, 0·7 g kg−1; 5-FQA, 1·4 g kg−1; 3-CQL, 2·1 g kg−1; 4-CQL, 1·0 g kg−1; 3,4-di-CQA, 0·7 g kg−1; 3,5-di-CQA, 0·4 g kg−1 and 4,5-di-CQA, 0·8 g kg−1 dry matter. There were only small differences between the different brands. Two series of samples with different degrees of roast produced from the same green coffee have also been analysed. One series was steam treated before roasting (a process which is commercially used to improve digestibility). Only in the initial stages of roasting (light roast) could a difference in the contents of the acids between both series be observed. Keeping coffee brews at an elevated temperature (4 h at 80°C) reduced the amounts of CQL to 60% of the initial value. The contents of 3-CQA and 4-CQA increased, whilst that of 5-CQA decreased. The overall contents of CQA decreased.",1
"Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and other onco-hematological conditions. Although subacute MTX-related neurotoxicity is relatively rare, it can present with dramatic, fluctuating neurological deficits that mimic other serious conditions. Diagnosis may be complicated by the frequent presence of asymptomatic white matter abnormalities on MRI, commonly attributed to chronic MTX toxicity. We report an 18-year-old ALL patient who developed severe, fluctuating neurological symptoms 11 days after the third intrathecal administration of MTX. MRI showed bilateral, symmetric diffusion-restrictive white matter lesions. Absent cortical motor evoked potentials (MEPs) with preserved responses to spinal stimulation indicated corticospinal tract involvement localized to the brain, supporting a diagnosis of MTX-induced neurotoxicity. Treatment with high-dose dextromethorphan led to rapid and complete recovery. This case underscores the value of early neurophysiological testing - particularly MEPs - in identifying corticospinal tract involvement and differentiating symptomatic neurotoxicity from chronic, asymptomatic MRI findings. Prompt recognition can accelerate diagnosis, guide treatment, and prevent unnecessary interventions.",0
"This scoping review was conducted to understand the barriers, facilitators, and education and training needs of rehabilitation clinicians in their use of mainstream wireless technologies (MWT) to support people with disabilities and older adults. It was also conducted to understand the functional skills of clients that were targeted with MWT use. This scoping review was reported using PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) and the Population (or Participants)/Concept/Context) framework. We searched PubMed; ProQuest to access APA PsycINFO; Web of Science Core Collection; and EBSCOhost to access Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Ovid MEDLINE ALL, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). Articles published between 2015-2022 were retrieved. A total of 90 articles were included. Most interventions were apps, smartphones, and tablets; were geared toward adults; and targeted motor, cognitive and speech skills. An infographic on barriers and facilitators was generated as a decision support tool for clinicians when implementing MWT. The topic, format, timing, and source of information clinicians need are also delineated. MWT such as apps, smartphones and tablets are being used by rehabilitation clinicians to address motor, cognitive, and speech skills, most commonly in adults. Clinicians voice a need for more education and training. Barriers and facilitators exist at the clinician-, technology-, client-, institution-, and policy levels.

"Olive oil and fruit samples from six cultivars sampled at four different maturity stages were discriminated into cultivars and maturity stages. The variables-volatile and phenolic compounds-that significantly (p < 0.01) discriminated cultivars and maturity stage groups were identified. Separation by stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that Manzanilla olive cultivar was separated from cultivars Leccino, Barnea, Mission, Corregiola, and Paragon, whereas cultivars Corregiola and Paragon formed a cluster. The volatile compounds hexanol, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were responsible for the discrimination of cultivars. All maturity stages were discriminated, with the separation of early stages attributed to oil phenolic compounds, tyrosol and oleuropein derivatives, whereas the volatile compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexanol, 1-penten-3-ol, and (Z)-2-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of all maturity stages and in particular the late stages. Hexanol and 1-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of both cultivars and maturity stages.",1
"The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat (Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg (whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes (26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols (524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).",1
"Food insecurity is a global public health problem and a likely determinant of poor diet quality. However, the relationship between food insecurity and diet quality among adolescents remains under-researched. This study examined the association between food insecurity and diet quality among pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers in Ghana. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among pregnant adolescents (n = 216) and adolescent mothers (n = 206) aged 12-19 y in Cape Coast, Ghana. Diet Quality indicators, including Food Group Diversity Score (FGDS), Minimum Diet Diversity for women (MDD-W), ALL-5 indicator, and dietary factors for noncommunicable diseases (NCD-Protect and NCD-Risk) were assessed using the Global Diet Quality Questionnaire (DQQ). Food Insecurity was measured using the Child Food Insecurity Experience Scale (CFIES). Linear and logistic regression were used to examine the association between food insecurity and diet quality indicators, adjusting for relevant covariates. Participants had a mean age of 18 ± 1.2 y. Most were out of school (70.50%) and unemployed (82.0%). Participants consumed 5 out of 10 food groups (FGDS 4.9 ± 1.7), and 56.8% met the MDD-W. The mean CFIES score was 9.5 ± 6.4, with 87.2% reporting some food insecurity in the past 30 d. Food insecurity was significantly associated with FGDS and MDD-W but not the ALL-5 indicator. Participants who experienced food insecurity were less likely to meet the MDD-W (odds ratio: 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.20, 0.77), consume NCD protective foods (β ± SE = -0.59 ± 0.22, Food insecurity was significantly associated with poor diet quality among pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers in Ghana. Interventions addressing food insecurity may improve diet quality in this population.",0
"The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.",1
"Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)/veno-occlusive disease (VOD) is generally associated with hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), but little is known about this condition outside the HCT setting. This systematic review examines the burden of illness and current management approaches in non-HCT SOS/VOD. We searched Embase, Medline, and grey literature sources for non-HCT SOS/VOD studies published 2002-2023. Inclusion criteria were studies of any design reporting incidence, diagnosis, underlying disease and any ongoing treatment at the time of SOS/VOD onset, management of non-HCT SOS/VOD, clinical burden, health-related quality of life, healthcare resource use, costs, and patients' unmet needs. Studies investigating pulmonary VOD or SOS/VOD related to the ingestion of pyrrolizidine alkaloids were excluded.Two authors independently screened results, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Motheral scale for retrospective studies, Newcastle-Ottawa scale for prospective studies and case control studies, the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials, and the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for case series. Results were synthesized narratively. Ninety-two studies were included; 57 % were retrospective cohort studies and 70 % were conducted in the US or Europe. The study populations included hematological and solid tumor cancers, various indications for liver transplant, Wilms' tumor, and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. Non-HCT SOS/VOD occurs most frequently in people with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Approximately 35 % of oxaliplatin-treated CRLM patients and 5 % of ALL and AML patients have non-HCT SOS/VOD. Diagnosis varies according to initial disease setting. Defibrotide is the most frequently reported treatment. Most studies did not clearly report their data sources or methods of outcome assessment. Non-HCT SOS/VOD occurs in diverse disease conditions, therefore guidelines on diagnosis and treatment are needed to optimize management in clinical practice.",0
"The present report describes a case of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) with pericardial invasion following bone marrow transplantation. The patient exhibited recurrent pericardial effusion accompanied by wheezing symptoms. Despite undergoing multiple pericardial punctures and drainage procedures, pericardial injections, and systemic treatment, the patient continued to experience recurrent pericardial effusion. Ultimately, the patient underwent whole-heart radiotherapy, resulting in complete resolution of the pericardial effusion. After a follow-up period of 10 months, the pericardial effusion remained well-controlled, and there were no significant impairments in cardiac function. In conclusion, radiotherapy may be considered as a viable treatment option for refractory leukemia cases presenting with pericardial effusion.",0
"Qualitative and quantitative high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) was performed to characterize the presence of phenolic compounds in Andean purple corn. Phenolic compounds were analyzed by separating them in two main fractions: a water fraction (WF) and an ethyl acetate fraction (EAF). The WF rich in anthocyanins revealed the presence of cyanidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside. The respective acylated anthocyanin glucoside forms of these compounds were also detected following alkaline hydrolysis. The EAF was composed of phenolic acids such as p-coumaric, vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid, flavonoids such quercetin derivatives and a hesperitin derivative. Alkaline and acid hydrolysis of the EAF revealed the presence of p-coumaric and ferulic acid as main components in four bound hydroxycinnamic acid forms present in the ethyl acetate fraction.",1
"Aberrant micro-RNA (miRNA) expression profiles have been associated with disease progression and clinical outcome in pediatric cancers. However, few studies have analyzed genome-wide dysregulation of miRNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). To identify novel prognostic factors, we comprehensively investigated miRNA and mRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq) data in pediatric BCP-ALL samples with poor outcome. We analyzed 180 patients, including 43 matched pairs at diagnosis and relapse. Consensus clustering of miRNA expression data revealed a distinct profile characterized by mainly downregulation of miRNAs (referred to as an miR-low cluster [MLC]). The MLC profile was not associated with any known genetic subgroups. Intriguingly, patients classified as MLC had significantly shorter event-free survival (median 21 vs 33 months; log-rank P = 3 ×10-5). Furthermore, this poor prognosis was retained even in hyperdiploid ALL. This poor prognostic MLC profiling was confirmed in the validation cohort. Notably, non-MLC profiling at diagnosis (n = 9 of 23; Fisher exact test, P = .039) often changed into MLC profiling at relapse for the same patient. Integrated analysis of miRNA-seq and mRNA-seq data revealed that the transcriptional profile of MLC was characterized by enrichment of MYC target and oxidative phosphorylation genes, reduced intron retention, and low expression of DICER1. Thus, our miRNA-mRNA integration approach yielded a truly unbiased molecular stratification of pediatric BCP-ALL cases based on a novel prognostic miRNA signature, which may lead to better clinical outcomes.",0
"The phenolic compounds present in 17 samples of Portuguese commercial and three homemade quince jams were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, to determine their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the complete definition of quince jams profiles, one of them including an Amberlite XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.",1
"Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.",1
"Qualitative and quantitative data are presented for the phenolic content of cvs Manzanillo and Cucco based on separation by high performance liquid chromatography, HPLC, with ultraviolet, fluorescence and mass spectrometric detection. Oleuropein is the principal phenolic compound in olive and its concentration changed significantly during fruit development. Changes in the content of tyrosol, ligstroside and verbascoside were also observed but these were relatively smaller.",1
"Research in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is translating into rapid changes in therapy and outcomes. Historically, adult ALL was treated with intensive chemotherapy extending over 2.5 to 3 years. This established tradition, accepted because of the high cure rates in childhood ALL, has been challenged by the development of highly active targeted therapies. Treatment modalities, combined with less and shorter chemotherapy durations, have produced better results than chemotherapy. The novel therapies include using the more potent BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, ponatinib, dasatinib) with the bispecific CD3-CD19 T-cell engager antibody blinatumomab in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL and combining blinatumomab and/or inotuzumab (CD22 antibody drug conjugate) with standard chemotherapy in B-cell ALL. These have been associated with improved 4-year survival rates of 85% to 90% in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL and 80% to 85% in B-cell ALL. The management of ALL is changing rapidly. Investigators have evaluated frontline and later-line regimens with combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies with less or no chemotherapy. Future research will evaluate CD19, CD20, and CD22 multitargeting antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, new antibody formulations, and less intensive/shorter regimens.",0
"Polyamines, namely putrescine, spermidine and spermine, are involved in multiple molecular pathways through their ability to bind nucleic acids and modulate protein stability. Their intracellular level is regulated through biosynthesis, catabolism and uptake from the extracellular milieu and the disruption of their homeostasis contributes to a variety of human disorders including cancer, as mainly described in solid tumors. Recently, there is an increasing interest in understanding polyamine functions in acute leukemias, due to the linkage between leukemic gene drivers, polyamine metabolism alterations and epigenetic defects. In particular, polyamine involvement in the regulation of acetylation and methylation is clinically relevant since epigenetic drugs are currently the backbone of novel therapeutic combinations, especially in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). With the exception of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), the enzyme leading to methionine regeneration that is frequently deleted in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), genes involved in polyamine metabolism and the interconnected methionine and arginine pathways are rarely targets of genetic lesions in acute leukemias. Conversely, functional alterations, including elevated polyamine levels and deregulated activity of enzymes involved in their metabolism, have been recently reported in leukemic cells. Notably, the polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine N1 acetyltransferase (SAT1) that is overexpressed in AML and associated with a myeloproliferative phenotype, is a tumor suppressor gene in ALL, suggesting diverse mechanisms of action across hematological malignancies according to the lineage commitment and the differentiation stage. In light of the promising results achieved in AML and ALL by selective targeting of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) and methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), two enzymes at the crossroad between polyamine metabolism and protein methylation, in this review we examine and discuss the role of polyamines in epigenetic regulation and other biological processes supporting leukemic cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, which provides the opportunity to discover additional polyamine-related targets and design novel therapeutic combinations.",0
"In the last decade polyphenol content of wines has attracted considerable interest as antioxidants. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) application for the determination of phenolic acids in the commercial wines of Turkey was carried out. Thirteen wine samples, differing in their origin of grape variety and vicinity, were analysed for total phenolic acid content by HPLC on C 18 -modified silica coupled with an electrochemical detector. The identification of phenolic compounds was made by comparison of their retention times with those of standards and by their electrochemical behaviour at potential of +0.650 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). HPLC analyses of wine extracts revealed the presence of gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and vanillic acid. The phenolic compounds of wines examined ranged from 0.008 mg l -1 to 42.5 mg l -1 . Among the phenolics identified, gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, syringic acid and ferulic acid were present in large amounts, respectively.",1
"Leukemia and its subtypes impose a major public health challenge in China. Identifying the secular trend of leukemia burden is critical to facilitate optimal healthcare planning and improve the management of leukemia. The incidence rates of leukemia from 1990 to 2019 were collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 database according to the following: subtype (acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL], chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML], and other leukemia subtypes), sex, and age group. The average annual percentage changes and relative risks were calculated using joinpoint regression and the age-period-cohort model, respectively. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model was also applied to predict the future trend of the incidence of leukemia and its subtypes in the next 25 years. From 1990 to 2019, the age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of leukemia slightly declined in males and females, which is similar to the trend of other leukemia subtypes. However, the four major leukemia subtypes, namely, ALL, AML, CLL, and CML, have been on the rise over the past three decades. The incidence rates of leukemia in children and the elderly were considerably higher than those in other age groups in males and females. Age effects were the most influential risk factor for leukemia incidence. Period effects showed that the risks of leukemia and its subtypes incidence increased with time. For cohort effects, the risks of leukemia and its subtypes were higher among the early-born cohorts compared with the late-born cohorts. The ASIRs of leukemia and its subtypes will continue to increase in the next 25 years. The burden of leukemia and its subtypes is expected to continue to increase in the next 25 years in males and females. A comprehensive understanding of the risk characteristics and disease pattern of leukemia and its subtypes is needed to formulate timely and effective intervention measures to reduce the leukemia burden in China.",0
"A better understanding of ABL1 kinase domain mutation-independent causes of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance is needed for BCR::ABL1-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Although TKIs have dramatically improved outcomes, a subset of patients still experiences relapsed or refractory disease. We aimed to identify potential biomarkers of intrinsic TKI resistance at diagnosis in samples from 32 pediatric and 19 adult patients with BCR::ABL1-positive BCP-ALL. Reduced ex vivo imatinib sensitivity was observed in cells derived from newly diagnosed patients who relapsed after combined TKI and chemotherapy treatment compared with cells derived from patients who remained in continuous complete remission. We observed that ex vivo imatinib resistance was inversely correlated with the amount of (phosphorylated) BCR::ABL1/ABL1 protein present in samples that were taken at diagnosis without prior TKI exposure. This suggests an intrinsic cause of TKI resistance that is independent of functional BCR::ABL1 signaling. Simultaneous deletions of IKZF1 and CDKN2A/B and/or PAX5 (IKZF1plus), as well as deletions of PAX5 alone, were related to ex vivo imatinib resistance. In addition, somatic lesions involving ZEB2, SETD2, SH2B3, and CRLF2 were associated with reduced ex vivo imatinib sensitivity. Our data suggest that the poor prognostic value of IKZF1(plus) deletions is linked to intrinsic mechanisms of TKI resistance other than ABL1 kinase domain mutations in newly diagnosed pediatric and adult BCR::ABL1-positive BCP-ALL.",0
"This scoping review focuses on the essential role of models for causal inference in shaping actionable artificial intelligence (AI) designed to aid clinicians in decision-making. The objective was to identify and evaluate the reporting quality of studies introducing models for causal inference in intensive care units (ICUs), and to provide recommendations to improve the future landscape of research practices in this domain. To achieve this, we searched various databases including Embase, MEDLINE ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and the ACM Digital Library. Studies involving models for causal inference addressing time-varying treatments in the adult ICU were reviewed. Data extraction encompassed the study settings and methodologies applied. Furthermore, we assessed reporting quality of target trial components (i.e., eligibility criteria, treatment strategies, follow-up period, outcome, and analysis plan) and main causal assumptions (i.e., conditional exchangeability, positivity, and consistency). Among the 2184 titles screened, 79 studies met the inclusion criteria. The methodologies used were G methods (61%) and reinforcement learning methods (39%). Studies considered both static (51%) and dynamic treatment regimes (49%). Only 30 (38%) of the studies reported all five target trial components, and only seven (9%) studies mentioned all three causal assumptions. To achieve actionable AI in the ICU, we advocate careful consideration of the causal question of interest, describing this research question as a target trial emulation, usage of appropriate causal inference methods, and acknowledgement (and examination of potential violations of) the causal assumptions.",0
"Many herbs are known as excellent sources of natural antioxidants, and consumption of fresh herbs in the diet may therefore contribute to the daily antioxidant intake. The present study was performed in order to quantify flavonoids in commonly eaten fresh herbs. Fifteen fresh herbs (basil, chives, coriander, cress, dill, lemon balm, lovage, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, spearmint, tarragon, thyme, and watercress) were analysed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Five major flavonoid aglycones were detected and quantified by HPLC after acid hydrolysis: apigenin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin. The highest levels of flavonoids were found in parsley (510–630 mg apigenin /100 g), lovage (170 mg quercetin/100g), mint (18–100 mg apigenin/100 g), and dill (48–110 mg quercetin/100 g). Mass spectrometric detection, using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI), was used to verify the presence of flavonoids in the hydrolysed extracts of herbs. Some traditional Danish dishes contain herbs, particularly parsley, dill, cress and chives, and the contribution to the flavonoid intake by consumption of these dishes was calculated.",1
"Phenolic compounds, organic acids and free amino acids of quince were evaluated, before and after jam processing, to test the effect of thermal processing in these compounds. In addition, the composition of jams prepared with peeled and unpeeled quinces was compared. Phenolics, organic acids and free amino acids were analysed by HPLC/DAD, HPLC/UV and GC/FID, respectively.",1
"Severe oral mucositis (OM) is one of the adverse events post-chemotherapy, radiation, and stem cell transplantation with major clinical and economic impact. The management of severe OM remains challenging. This study aimed to look for the benefit and clinical impact of palifermin for mucositis among the non-transplanted pediatric cancer population. This is a descriptive retrospective study extended from 2016 to 2020 at Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC), in Saudi Arabia. During this period all pediatric patients (< 14 years of age) on chemotherapy and complicated by severe OM that required palifermin (35 courses), as off-labeled medication, were analyzed looking for the clinical demographics, primary diagnosis, chemotherapy agents used, effectiveness, and tolerability of palifermin. A total of 29 patients with severe OM received 35 palifermin courses. All of them received 60 mcg/kg/day IV for 3 consecutive days. 20% of them have acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We noticed that 60% of severe OM required palifermin post anthracycline while high-dose methotrexate aggravates the risk in 40% of them. Only 25.7% of the patients required TPN for a median duration of 5 days and 54.3% of them received opioids for a median duration of 4 days. Twenty patients (57.1%) had used antibiotics, 4 patients were on antifungal medication and 1 patient was on anti-viral medication concomitant with antibiotics. Palifermin is safe and well tolerated and shows some effect in non-hematopoietic stem cell transplant pediatric patients with severe oral mucositis post-intensified chemotherapy or radiation therapy.",0
"We present a four-year-old girl with synchronous T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL).Development of two lymphoid malignancies arising from completely different cell lineages was confirmed by molecular tests. The cause of cancerogenesis in this patient was a genetic predisposition resulting from mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (CMMRD). Herein, we present the fatal course of the disorder, challenging treatment decisions and need for special approach to the patients with CMMRD-associated malignant proliferation.",0
"ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) is a type of hematological malignancy that involves developmental and differentiation arrest at the lymphoblast stage. BLACE, a gene specifically expressed in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia shows little or no expression in mature B-lymphocytes. The current pilot study involves transcriptional analysis of BLACE in B-cell ALL patients. Expression of BLACE was high in both pediatric and adult ALL patients. Promoter analysis of the BLACE gene showed the presence of CAAT and TATA box promoters and G-rich sequences with a potential to form G-quadruplexes. Due to identification of TAL1 transcription factor binding sites within the BLACE promoter region, expression of TAL1 gene was measured and found to correlate with the BLACE expression. The presence of an overlapping G-rich sequence and TAL1 binding site at -1291 bps within BLACE promoter indicated a new target site for controlling BLACE expression. The docking studies performed between BLACE-TAL1 protein showed a binding score of -208.68 kcal/mol and identified 21 BLACE nucleotide - TAL1 residues interacting at the docking interface. Together, our findings suggested that BLACE gene specifically expressed in B-cell ALL could serve as a new therapeutic target. Further investigations are required to get a comprehensive understanding of the BLACE gene mechanism.",0
"Due to the present low availability of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for individuals recovering from a COPD exacerbation (ECOPD), we need admission priority criteria. We tested the hypothesis that these individuals might be clustered according to baseline characteristics to identify subpopulations with different responses to PR. Multicentric retrospective analysis of individuals undergone in-hospital PR. Baseline characteristics and outcome measures (six-minute walking test - 6MWT, Medical Research Council scale for dyspnoea -MRC, COPD assessment test -CAT) were used for clustering analysis. Data analysis of 1159 individuals showed that after program, the proportion of individuals reaching the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was 85.0%, 86.3%, and 65.6% for CAT, MRC, and 6MWT respectively. Three clusters were found (C1-severe: 10.9%; C2-intermediate: 74.4%; C3-mild: 14.7% of cases respectively). Cluster C1-severe showed the worst conditions with the largest post PR improvements in outcome measures; C3-mild showed the least severe baseline conditions, but the smallest improvements. The proportion of participants reaching the MCID in ALL three outcome measures was significantly different among clusters, with C1-severe having the highest proportion of full success (69.0%) as compared to C2-intermediate (48.3%) and C3-mild (37.4%). Participants in C2-intermediate and C1-severe had 1.7- and 4.6-fold increases in the probability to reach the MCID in all three outcomes as compared to those in C3-mild (OR = 1.72, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 1.2 - 2.49, p = 0.0035 and OR = 4.57, 95% CI = 2.68 - 7.91, p < 0.0001 respectively). Clustering analysis can identify subpopulations of individuals recovering from ECOPD associated with different responses to PR. Our results may help in defining priority criteria based on the probability of success of PR.",0
"Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per serving.",1
"High levels of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) transaminase 1 (BCAT1) have been associated with tumor aggressiveness and drug resistance in several cancer types. Nevertheless, the mechanistic role of BCAT1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains uncertain. We provide evidence that Bcat1 was over-expressed following NOTCH1-induced transformation of leukemic progenitors and that NOTCH1 directly controlled BCAT1 expression by binding to a BCAT1 promoter. Further, using a NOTCH1 gain-of-function retroviral model of T-ALL, mouse cells genetically deficient for Bcat1 showed defects in developing leukemia. In murine T-ALL cells, Bcat1 depletion or inhibition redirected leucine metabolism towards production of 3-hydroxy butyrate (3-HB), an endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitor. Consistently, BCAT1-depleted cells showed altered protein acetylation levels which correlated with a pronounced sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In human NOTCH1-dependent leukemias, high expression levels of BCAT1 may predispose to worse prognosis. Therapeutically, BCAT1 inhibition specifically synergized with etoposide to eliminate tumors in patient-derived xenograft models suggesting that BCAT1 inhibitors may have a part to play in salvage protocols for refractory T-ALL.",0
"Understanding the mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid (GC) resistance in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is essential to improve survival rates in relapsed children. We previously showed that GCs paradoxically induced their own resistance in B-ALL through CXCR4/PLC signaling, and that the inhibition of this pathway significantly reverses GC resistance in B-ALL cells and improves survival of GC-treated NSG mice in vivo. Here, we sought to determine whether the enhancement of GC sensitivity via inhibition of the CXCR4/PLC axis is associated with disruption of the mitochondrial pathway. Analysis of our previous transcriptomic data revealed that in B-ALL, the PLC inhibitor U73122 compromised multiple metabolic pathways related to metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. Inhibition of PLC with U73122, protein kinase C with GF109203X, or CXCR4 with AMD3100 significantly potentiated dexamethasone (Dex)-induced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, reactive oxygen species production, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, and decreased O",0
"Interest in the consumption of fresh fruits is, to a large extent, due to its content of bioactive nutrients and their importance as dietary antioxidants. There is a growing demand for delivery of antioxidants through functional foods with the related challenge of protecting their bioactivity during food processing and subsequent passage through the gastrointestinal tract. This study focuses on the evaluation of concentration of bioactive compounds in black currant berries (Ribes nigrum L.) and retention of black currant polyphenol compounds and their antioxidant activity after microencapsulation by spray-drying. The polyphenol contents and antioxidant activities were assessed for 5 black currant cultivars grown in Canada in fresh and stored fruits at −20 °C for 9 months. The Ben Alder cultivar was the richest in anthocyanins and flavonols content with high antioxidant potential measured with ABTS and DPPH radicals (4.5 and 2.4 mM/100 g). Black currant polyphenols were stable during 9 month of storage at −20 °C. The results of this study indicated that in black currants storage did not affect negatively the antioxidant capacity. The good stability of bioactive compounds of black currants during freezer storage allows prolonging the storage time of these berries. Maltodextrins with different DE (dextrose equivalent): DE11, DE18, DE21 and inulin were selected as wall material. The stability of encapsulated polyphenols during 12 months storage at 8 °C and 25 °C was evaluated. Compared to maltodextrins DE18 and DE21, maltodextrin DE11 had not only higher drying yield but also offered better protection for phenolics during storage. Radical scavenging activity studies demonstrated significant antioxidant activity of microencapsulated powders before and after storage. The black currant polyphenol microcapsules described in this study represent a promising food additive for incorporation into functional foods due to antioxidant content.",1
"Background Inflammation plays a very important role in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, such as atherosclerosis myocardial infarction, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association of IL-8 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients. Methodology IL-8 levels were estimated in 52 individuals. Of the study population, 26 were T-ALL patients (all phases of leukemia were included in the study) and 26 were disease-free healthy volunteers. In this study, we employed flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test, and western blot analysis. Results IL-8 was significantly higher in all T-ALL patients than in healthy volunteers. IL-8 levels showed a significant positive correlation in T-ALL patients at the genomic and proteomic levels. Conclusions Higher serum IL-8 levels were associated with the advanced disease stage of the clinicopathological parameters. Our results indicate that monitoring IL-8 has a role in modulating disease sensing in T-ALL and may represent a target for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",0
"To reducing chemotherapy-related toxicity, the chemo-free regimens become a new trend of Ph + ALL treatment. Therefore, we conducted a phase 2 trial of dasatinib plus prednisone, as induction (Course I) and early consolidation (Courses II and III) treating newly diagnosed Ph + ALL. The trial was registered at www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000038053. Forty-one patients were enrolled from 15 hospitals. The complete remission (CR) was 95% (39/41), including two elderly induction deaths. By the end of Course III, 25.6% (10/39) of patients achieved a complete molecular response. With a median follow-up of 15.4 months, 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) were 100% and 33% for patients who receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at CR1 and receiving chemotherapy alone respectively. When censored at time of HSCT, 2-year DFS were 51% and 45% for young and elderly patients (p = 0.987). 2-year overall survival were 45%, 86% and 100% for patients without HSCT, receiving HSCT after relapse and receiving HSCT at CR1 respectively. A total of 12 patients had marrow recurrences and one had CNS relapse, with 38% occurred early (between Courses I and III). IKZF1 gene deletion was shown to be associated with relapse (p = 0.019). This chemo-free induction and early consolidation regimen was efficacious and well-tolerated in de novo Ph + ALL. Allogeneic HSCT conferred definite survival advantage after chemo-free induction.",0
"Overall survival rates of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in high-income countries approach 90%. Treated on the same protocols, outcomes in India, were ∼65%. The Indian Childhood Collaborative Leukaemia (ICiCLe) group used genetics and measurable residual disease (MRD) to categorise B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL as standard (SR), intermediate (IR) and high-risk (HR) to receive increasing intensity of therapy. T-ALL were treated uniformly. Data on risk stratification, deaths and relapses were collected annually. 2695 patients aged 1-18 years were enrolled between January 2013 and May 2018. Induction deaths were significantly lower in SR patients (p = 0·002) compared to others. At a median 61 (59-62) months, the 4-year event free and overall survival was 76% (72-79%) and 88% (85-90%) in SR; 70% (66-74%) and 80% (77-83%) in IR; 61% (51-64%) and 73% (70-76%) in HR; and 69% (62-75%) and 77% (70-83%) in T-ALL patients (p < 0·0001). For BCP-ALL, regression analyses showed age, white cell count, bulky disease, high risk genetics and treating centre as independent prognostic variables. The cumulative incidence of treatment deaths (TRD) and relapses at centres varied from 2% (1-5) to 13% (10-17) (p ≤ 0·0001); and 21% (17-26) to 45% (39-51) (p ≤ 0·0001) respectively with significant differences in proportion of BCP-ALL patients with MRD ≥ 0·01% (p = 0·0007) and time to relapse (p = 0·0001). Risk stratified directed reduced intensity treatment and collaboration decreases treatment deaths and relapses. Standardisation of genetic and MRD tests across centres and access to high quality drugs will lead to further improvements in survival. DBT-Wellcome; UKIERI, TCS Foundation.",0
"The three major botanical components (starchy endosperm, aleurone layer and pericarp) of eight durum wheat samples exhibited significantly different compositions and concentrations in phenolic acids. The starchy endosperm, the aleurone layer and the pericarp were respectively characterised by a low content in ferulic acid (FA), a high content intrans -sinapic acid (t -SA), and a high content in ferulic acid dehydrodimers (DHD). These three chemical markers can be exploited to differentiate the three grain botanical parts within milling fractions and to evaluate the milling efficiency, particularly the separation between bran and endosperm. The histological dissociation of the wheat grain generated by the milling process can be investigated further into details using the three phenolic acids markers. A separability index (S i) was proposed in order to quantify the ease of dissociation of endosperm from bran. Differences in S i values between wheat varieties grown under various agricultural conditions demonstrated the relevant variability of this character. The structural and molecular factors implied in the control of tissue dissociation are discussed in details.",1
"Blinatumomab has shown to improve survival outcomes in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients with measurable residual disease (MRD) detected by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC). However, data on blinatumomab clearing MRD with high sensitivity remain scarce. This study evaluates the effectiveness of blinatumomab in eradicating low levels of MRD, as detected by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) but undetectable by MFC, in children with B-ALL. Patients (n = 9) whose MRD was undetectable by MFC but detectable by ddPCR after chemotherapy and followed by blinatumomab consolidation were included retrospectively. After the administration of blinatumomab, 5 out of 9 patients (55.56%) successfully achieved undetectable levels of ddPCR-MRD. Notably, among the 4 patients with BCR::ABL1 gene-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), only one achieved gene negativity. Starting from the initiation of blinatumomab treatment, with a median follow-up of 12 months, all patients remained in complete remission. Our study was the first to demonstrate that blinatumomab could further eradicate ddPCR MRD after patients achieve MFC-MRD undetectable status in B-ALL patients.",0
"This study aimed to develop highly precise radiomics and deep learning models to accurately detect acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using a T1WI image. A total of 604 brain magnetic resonance data of ALL group and normal children (NC) group. Two radiologists independently retrieved radiomics features after manually delineating the area of interest along the clivus at the median sagittal position of T1WI. According to the 9:1 ratio, all samples were randomly divided into the training cohort and the testing cohort. support vector machine was then used to classify the radiomics model using the features that had a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.99 in the training cohort. The Efficientnet-B3 network model received the training set images to create a deep learning model. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve were calculated in order to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the different models after the validation of two aforementioned models in the testing cohort. The deep learning model had a higher AUC value of 0.981 than the radiomics model's value of 0.962 in the testing cohort. Delong's test showed no statistical difference between the two models (P>0.05). The accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/negative predictive value/positive predictive value achieved 0.9180/0.9565/0.8947/0.9714/0.8462 for the radiomics model and 0.9344/0.8696/0.9737/0.9250/0.9524 for deep learning model. The deep learning and radiomics models showed high AUC values in the training and test cohorts. They also exhibited good diagnostic efficacy for predicting ALL.",0
"The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays a significant role in the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Rapamycin is a potential therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies due to its ability to suppress mTOR activity. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in T-ALL pathophysiology and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the combined effects of rapamycin and miRNAs in inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in T-ALL cells. Bioinformatic algorithms were used to find miRNAs that inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Twenty-five bone marrow samples were collected from T-ALL patients, alongside five control bone marrow samples from non-leukemia patients. The Jurkat cell line was chosen as a representative model for T-ALL. Gene and miRNA expression levels were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Two miRNAs exhibiting down-regulation in both clinical samples and Jurkat cells were transfected to the Jurkat cell line to investigate their impact on target gene expression. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the potential of combination therapy involving miRNAs and rapamycin, apoptosis and cell cycle assays were carried out. Six miRNAs (miR-3143, miR-3182, miR-99a/100, miR-155, miR-576-5p, and miR-501- 3p) were predicted as inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The expression analysis of both clinical samples and the Jurkat cell line revealed a simultaneous downregulation of miR-3143 and miR-3182. Transfection investigation demonstrated that the exogenous overexpression of miR-3143 and miR-3182 can effectively inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in the Jurkat cell line. Moreover, when used as a dual inhibitor along with rapamycin, miR-3143 and miR-3182 significantly increased apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in the Jurkat cell line. These preliminary results highlight the potential for improving T-ALL treatment through multi-targeted therapeutic strategies involving rapamycin and miR-3143/miR-3182.",0
"CD147 is upregulated in cancers, including aggressive T-ALL. Traditional treatments for T-ALL often entail severe side effects and the risk of relapse, highlighting the need for more efficacious therapies. ADCP contributes to the antitumor response by enhancing the ability of phagocytic cells to engulf cancer cells upon antibody binding. We aimed to engineer CD147",0
"Whether the beneficial effects of pomegranate are due to the ellagitannins or to their microbiota-derived urolithins is not known. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of pomegranate intake and its main microbiota-derived metabolite urolithin-A (UROA) on colon inflammation and to assess whether UROA is the main anti-inflammatory compound. In addition, the effect of the inflammation on the phenolic metabolism was also explored. Male Fisher rats were fed with 250 mg kg(-1) day(-1) pomegranate extract (PE) or 15 mg kg(-1) day(-1) UROA for 25 days. Dextran sodium sulfate (5%) (DSS) was administered for the five last days and then rats were euthanized. DSS is a well-known model of inflammatory bowel disease. Colon tissue damage, microbiota changes, antioxidant status, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), nitric oxide production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), gene expression (microarrays and RT-PCR) and polyphenol metabolism (LC-MS-MS) were evaluated. Both PE and UROA decreased inflammation markers (iNOS, cycloxygenase-2, PTGES and PGE(2) in colonic mucosa) and modulated favorably the gut microbiota. The G(1) to S cell cycle pathway was up-regulated in both groups. UROA group showed various down-regulated pathways, including that of the inflammatory response. PE, but not UROA, decreased oxidative stress in plasma and colon mucosa. Only UROA preserved colonic architecture. The normal formation of urolithins in PE-fed rats was prevented during inflammation. Our results suggest that UROA could be the most active anti-inflammatory compound derived from pomegranate ingestion in healthy subjects, whereas in colon inflammation, the effects could be due to the nonmetabolized ellagitannin-related fraction.",1
"CAR T-cell therapy is a recent therapeutic advancement that has transformed the management of relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). To date, there are 2 FDA-approved CAR-T products for R/R B-ALL: tisagenlecleucel in patients aged <26 years and brexucabtagene autoleucel in those aged ≥18 years. This review summarizes the pivotal clinical trials that led to FDA approval of these 2 products and highlight emerging data addressing key questions pertinent to CAR-T utilization in the rapidly evolving landscape of R/R ALL management. These include optimal sequencing of CAR-T among other novel immunotherapeutic agents, the role of consolidation and maintenance following CAR-T, novel CAR-T constructs currently under clinical development, and strategies to optimize use of commercially available CAR-T products to improve patient outcomes.",0
"We comprehensively profiled the landscape of immunoglobulin (IG) and T-cell receptor (TR) rearrangements at diagnosis in 1212 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 573 children and 639 adults) diagnosed in Germany between 2017 and 2022. Our study revealed a significant age-related decrease in immunogenetic maturation, where IG κ rearrangements in B-ALL and complete TR β/δ rearrangements in T-ALL, hallmarks of maturity, were more frequent in pediatric patients compared to adults (B-ALL: 68.7% vs 39.0%, P < 2.2e-16; T-ALL: 85.7% vs 67.3%, P = 6.7e-03). Compared to adults, children had a higher average number of IG/TR markers per patient (6 vs 4; P = 2.5e-38) and markedly fewer lacked these markers (0.5% compared to 6.7%). IG heavy chain clonal evolution was most pronounced among pro-B-ALL cases (60.9%), with the V-to-DJ mechanism driving pro-B evolution (78.6%), whereas V-replacement dominated other immunophenotypes. Furthermore, expanded accompanying T-cell clones of unknown significance in B-ALL increased with age. This next-generation sequencing-based study offers an unprecedented characterization of IG/TR rearrangement patterns across ALL subtypes and age groups. It highlights the higher immunogenetic maturity in children, which may be explained by the infection-driven abnormal activity of the IG/TR recombination machinery in pediatric ALL.",0
"High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is seen as an effective therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, it is extremely toxic. Monitoring the plasma concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) and its important metabolite, 7-hydroxy-methotrexate (7-OH-MTX), on a routine basis aids in dose modification of rescue medications and in avoiding toxicity. The pharmacologically active and toxic effects of drugs are due to the unbound portion, as most drugs are bound to plasma proteins to some degree. However, the simultaneous measurement of unbound plasma concentrations of MTX and 7-OH-MTX has not been reported. We developed and validated a hollow fiber centrifugal ultrafiltration (HFCF-UF) technology to simultaneously analyze unbound MTX and 7-OH-MTX concentrations in human plasma. In total, 234 plasma samples from 58 children diagnosed with ALL who were administered HD-MTX were used in our study. We investigated the connection between unbound and total plasma concentrations of MTX and 7-OH-MTX, as well as how these concentrations relate to liver and renal function. The method that was developed is both simple and accurate. A weak linear relationship was observed between the concentrations of unbound and total 7-OH-MTX ( The total concentration of 7-OH-MTX is an unreliable predictor of unbound concentration, necessitating the monitoring of unbound levels. The concentration ratios of 7-OH-MTX to MTX (both total and unbound) could be more accurate and sensitive biomarkers for predicting hepatotoxicity.",0
"Acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a type of leukemia that can occur in both pediatric and adult populations. Compared to acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), patients with T-cell T-ALL have a poorer therapeutic efficacy. In this study, a novel anti-CD7 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC, J87-Dxd) was successfully generated and used for T-ALL treatment. Firstly, to obtain anti-CD7 mAbs, we expressed and purified the CD7 protein extracellular domain. Utilizing hybridoma technology, we obtained three anti-CD7 mAbs (J87, G73 and A15) with a high affinity for CD7. Both the results of immunofluorescence and Biacore assay indicated that J87 (KD = 1.54 × 10",0
"PurposeTo compare the clinical and radiological results of two double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) techniques. DB ACLR and anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) with internal brace (IB), and outside-in (OI) DB ACLR.HypothesisWe hypothesized that DB ACLR and ALLR with IB wound yield less femoral tunnel, especially femoral posterolateral bundle tunnel complications, than OI DB ACLR without ALLR because of better rotational control. Both techniques could provide good postoperative clinical outcomes.MethodsPatients who received DB ACLR and ALLR (ALLR group) and who received outside-in DB ACLR (non-ALLR group) were enrolled. Age, BMI, follow-up duration, meniscus repair, laterality, and knee range of motion (ROM) were collected. Lysholm, Tegner scale, and radiological results were compared.ResultsThirty-four and 33 patients were enrolled in the ALLR and non-ALLR groups. Patient demographics were similar between groups. Both groups showed postoperative improvements in Lysholm (ALLR group, 62.5 ± 6.8 preoperatively and 85.1 ± 5.7 postoperatively (",0
"Isoflavones and lignans are soy phytoestrogens that have been suggested to be anticarcinogenic. The mechanisms by which they exert cancer-preventive effects may involve modulation of estrogen synthesis and metabolism. To evaluate this hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone feeding study was performed in 12 healthy premenopausal women. The study consisted of three diet periods, each separated by a washout of approximately 3 weeks. Each diet period lasted for three menstrual cycles plus 9 days (averaging approximately 100 days), during which subjects consumed their habitual diets supplemented with soy protein powder providing 0.16 (control diet), 1.01, or 2.01 mg of total isoflavones per kg of body weight per day (10+/-1.1, 65+/-9.4, or 129+/-16 mg/day, respectively). A 72-h urine sample was collected during the midfollicular phase (days 7-9) of the fourth menstrual cycle in each diet period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids and lignans significantly increased with increased isoflavone consumption. Compared with the control diet, increased isoflavone consumption decreased urinary excretion of estradiol, estrone, estriol, and total estrogens, as well as excretion of the hypothesized genotoxic estrogen metabolites, 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestrone, and 4-hydroxyestradiol. Of importance are the observations of a significant increase in the 2-hydroxyestrone/16alpha-hydroxyestrone ratio and a decrease in the genotoxic/total estrogens ratio. These data suggest that soy isoflavone consumption may exert cancer-preventive effects by decreasing estrogen synthesis and altering metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.",1
"Total phenolic content of seven improved common bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) namely, Negro Altiplano, Negro Durango, Negro Sahuatoba, Flor de mayo sol, Flor de Mayo Bajío, Flor de Mayo 94044MX and Bayo Madero were analyzed. Acetone and methanol extracts from bean cotyledons were obtained by successive extractions. Total phenolic content was evaluated following Folin–Ciocalteu method; antioxidant activity by the DPPH technique; antimutagenic potential by the Ames method; and preliminary identification was realized by 2D-TLC. Results indicated high correlation between total phenol content and antioxidant activity for acetone extracts, and also high correlation between antioxidant and antimutagenic activities. In contrast, low correlation coefficients were obtained for methanol extracts. Three cultivars (two Negro cultivars and a Flor de Mayo type) showed lower antimutagenic activity than catechin.",1
"Tea has been proposed to have beneficial health effects which have been attributed to the polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. The bioavailability and biotransformation of these compounds, however, are not clearly understood. In this study, we used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to determine urinary glucuronidated and sulfated tea catechins and their metabolites (including methylated and ring-fission metabolites) based on the detection of deprotonated molecular ions and aglycone fragment ions. The compound resolution was achieved both chromatographically and mass spectroscopically. After green tea administration, the major conjugates appeared in human, mouse, and rat urine samples were identified as monoglucuronides and monosulfates of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin. We also found O-methyl-EGC-O-glucuronides and -O-sulfates and O-methyl-epicatechin-O-sulfates in human urine. (-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), the ring-fission metabolites of EGC and (-)-epicatechin, respectively, were also predominantly in monoglucuronide and monosulfate forms in the urine. In comparison to rats, the urinary metabolite profiles of tea catechins in mice resemble more closely to those in humans. This is the first report describing direct simultaneous analysis of multiple tea catechin conjugates in urine samples. This method will allow more thorough investigations of the biotransformation of tea polyphenols.",1
"Phenolic profiles of a total of 26 berry samples, together with 2 apple samples, were analyzed without hydrolysis of glycosides with HPLC. The phenolic contents among different berry genera varied considerably. Anthocyanins were the main phenolic constituents in bilberry, bog-whortleberry, and cranberry, but in cowberries, belonging also to the family Ericaceae genus Vaccinium, flavanols and procyanidins predominated. In the family Rosaceae genus Rubus (cloudberry and red raspberry), the main phenolics found were ellagitannins, and in genus Fragaria (strawberry), ellagitannins were the second largest group after anthocyanins. However, phenolic acids were dominant in rowanberries (genus Sorbus) and anthocyanins in chokeberry (genus Aronia). In the family Grossulariaceae genus Ribes (currants and gooseberry), anthocyanins predominated, as well as in crowberries (family Empetraceae genus Empetrum). In apples, hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic subgroup. Extraction methods for berries and apples were studied to produce phenolic extracts with high antioxidant activity. Evaluation of antioxidant activity was performed by autoxidazing methyl linoleate (40 degrees C, in the dark). The extraction method affected remarkably both the phenolic composition and the antioxidant activity, but with statistical analysis the observed activity could not be well explained with the contents of individual phenolic subgroups.",1
"Six flavonoids have been isolated and identified in buckwheat grain. These are rutin, orientin, vitexin, quercetin, isovitexin, and isoorientin. Rutin and isovitexin are the only flavonoid components of buckwheat seeds while hulls contain all six identified compounds. The total flavonoid concentration in the seeds was 18.8 and in the hulls 74 mg/100 g of dry matter. Dehulling the grain by using different temperature regimes resulted in drastic reductions of the total flavonoid concentration in the grain (by 75% of the control) and smaller but significant (15-20%) reduction in the hulls.",1
"Fresh persimmons were subjected to two different processes: sun-drying during 1 month and dehydration at 60°C during 12h. To assess the effect of this process on nutritional and health-related properties of persimmons dietary fibers, minerals, trace elements, polyphenols and the total radical scavenging activities (TRSAs) were determined before and after processing. It was found that the contents of dietary fibers, minerals and trace elements in fresh and dried persimmons fruits were comparable. Total polyphenols in fresh persimmons was higher than in dried fruits (1.3 vs. 0.9 and 0.8mg/100g FW, respectively) and percentage of inhibition was higher than in dried fruits (70% vs. 59% and 55% and 58% vs. 53% and 46% for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) [ABTS] radicals, respectively (P>0.05 in all cases). In conclusion: (1) the differences in the contents of dietary fibers, minerals and trace elements in fresh and dried persimmons are not significant; (2) the contents of polyphenols and the level of the TRSA are higher in fresh persimmons than in dried fruits; however, both variables are also high in dried persimmons; (3) when fresh fruits are not available, proper dried persimmons could be used as a valuable substitute.",1
"By using the mass production system, we could harvest the buckwheat sprouts that had their pericarps completely removed. As seeding days progressed, monosaccharides in buckwheat sprouts were rapidly increased, while di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides were gradually decreased. Linoleic acid (C18:2) was found to be the major fatty acid of buckwheat sprouts and increased up to 52.1% at 7 days after seeding (DAS), and total unsaturated fatty acid composition was greater than 83%. Free amino acid contents in buckwheat sprouts were almost four-times higher than those of buckwheat seeds. Based on these results, it was concluded that the abundance of lysine, γ-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) and sulfur containing amino acids in buckwheat sprouts provides a high nutritional value as a new vegetable. Rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside), quericitrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside), chlorogenic acid, and two unknown compounds were presented in both buckwheat seeds and sprouts. As seeding days progressed, rutin, quercitrin, and unknown compound B (431 m/z) were notably increased, while chlorogenic acid and unknown compound A (451 m/z) were moderately increased. Among the water-soluble vitamins, vitamin B1+B6, vitamin C, and two kinds of unidentified compounds were presented in the buckwheat sprouts. Vitamin C contents of buckwheat sprouts were increased and its maximum content (171.5 mg/100 g) was observed at 7 DAS. On the other hand, vitamin B1+B6 contents were moderately increased. Buckwheat sprouts not only have the soft and slightly crispy texture, and attractive fragrance, but also have abundant nutrients.",1
"In spite of the wide literature describing the biological effects of phenolic compounds, scarce data are available on their absorption from diet. In the present work, we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from beer, a common beverage rich in different phenolic acids with related chemical structures. Beer was analyzed for free and total (free+bound) phenolic acids. Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were present in beer mainly as bound forms, while 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid were present mainly as free forms. Vanillic acid was present equally in the free and bound forms. Plasma samples were collected before and 30 and 60 min after beer administration and analyzed for free and conjugated phenolic acid content. A significant two- to fourfold increase in plasma levels of phenolic acids was detected with peak concentrations at 30 min after beer ingestion. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid was present in plasma mainly as nonconjugated forms while p-coumaric acid was present equally as nonconjugated and conjugated forms. Ferulic, vanillic and caffeic acids were present in plasma predominantly as conjugated forms, with a slight prevalence of sulfates with respect to glucuronates. Our results indicate that phenolic acids from beer are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are present in blood after being largely metabolized to the form of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The extent of conjugation is related to the chemical structure of phenolic acids: the monohydroxy derivatives showing the lowest conjugation degree and the dihydroxy derivatives showing the highest one.",1
"Infections are still a significant cause of mortality in children with hematologic malignancies. Fusariosis is a relatively rare and opportunistic infection, which may present dangerous course and a poor prognosis. Below, we describe the fatal course of a 15-years old patient with a combined bone marrow and testicular relapse of ALL and multisystemic Fusariosis oxysporum infection with fulminant evolution. Despite aggressive therapy, which included multiagent antifungal treatment and surgical debridement, patient succumbed to the disease. The review of the literature was conducted and the need for early detection of fusarium symptoms was emphasized. The case encourages further research in the prevention and treatment of the illness.",0
"Using analytical methods based upon high performance liquid chromatography, the quercetin and p-coumaric acid concentrations were analyzed in 872 and 547 commercial red wines, respectively, from 14 of the world's leading wine-producing regions or countries. Quercetin concentrations were clearly highest in wines from warmer climates notable for high sunshine including Australia, California, South Africa, South America, Midi, and Provence, an exception being the Rhone Valley region of France. Among wines from individual cultivars, those of Pinot noir were consistently the lowest, although the Oregon wines from this cultivar matched the quercetin concentrations of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot-based wines from neighboring Washington State. The distribution of p-coumaric acid in red wines seemed to be more random than that of quercetin. Highest values were observed in Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot wines from Bordeaux, Australia, California, Washington State, and South Africa. Climate and sunlight appeared to be less consistent determinants of concentration than was the case with quercetin, and genetically determined metabolic set-points may be more relevant for this key phenolic acid that acts as a precursor of trihydroxystilbenes as well as of flavonoids and flavan 3-ols.",1
"Representative cultivars of different coloured onions were compared to determine the extent of differences in the distribution of free and total (bound and free) quercetin among different onion rings. The dry skin, outer rings, and inner rings were separated and extracted with ethanol to obtain quercetin glycosides (bound form) that were then hydrolyzed to free quercetin. Free quercetin was used as the standard for quantification by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Significant difference (P = 0.05) in total quercetin content was observed between the dry skin and inner rings (edible parts). A decrease in total quercetin content was observed from the dry skin to inner rings. The highest total quercetin concentration was observed in the dry skins of ‘Red Bone’ (30.66 g kg–1 dry weight) while ‘Contessa’ contain the least amount (0.094 g kg–1 dry weight). Total quercetin content in outer rings (1–2) in ‘Kadavan’ was high highest (345.51 mg kg–1 fresh weight); however, trace amounts were observed in ‘Contessa’. Inner rings (5–6 and 7–10) contain less total quercetin in all the cultivars. Outer rings (cataphylls) of all the cultivars except ‘Texas Grano 1015Y’ and ‘Contessa’ contain moderate amounts (2.5–16 mg kg–1 fresh weight) of free quercetin. ‘Red Bone’ skin contain the highest amount of free quercetin (20.64 g kg–1 dry weight). Quercetin distribution based on fresh and dry weight method was also evaluated.",1
"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains an important curative treatment for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Over time, significant progress in transplant and post-transplant care has allowed the delivery of transplant to older patients. We assessed changes over time in characteristics and outcomes in patients ≥60 years with ALL using a dataset from the EBMT registry. We identified 832 adult patients, with T-cell ALL (n = 143), Philadelphia chromosome positive B-cell ALL (n = 471), or Philadelphia chromosome negative B-cell ALL, transplanted 2010-2022 in first remission irrespective of the donor type. Those included 280 patients transplanted in 2010-2015, and 552 patients transplanted in 2016-2022. Patients transplanted in recent years were slightly older, more likely to have T or Ph- B-ALL and to receive a myeloablative total body irradiation conditioning. The 2-year leukemia free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) increased over time from 42-55% and from 51-65%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, LFS, OS, chronic and extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease rates were better in recent years (hazard ratio[HR] 0.68, 0.71, 0.66 and 0.5, respectively). These real-world data can serve as a benchmark indicating that the opportunity for transplant for the fit elderly should be considered and offered when possible.",0
"Molecular analysis is the hallmark of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) categorization. Several T-ALL sub-groups are well recognized based on the aberrant expression of specific transcription factors. This recently resulted in the implementation of eight provisional T-ALL entities into the novel 2022 International Consensus Classification, albeit not into the updated World Health Organization classification system. Despite this extensive molecular characterization, cytogenetic analysis remains the backbone of T-ALL diagnosis in many countries as chromosome banding analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization are relatively inexpensive techniques to obtain results of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic interest. Here, we provide an overview of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities detectable in T-ALL patients and propose guidelines regarding their detection. By referring in parallel to the more general molecular classification approach, we hope to offer a diagnostic framework useful in a broad clinical genetic setting.",0
"White and blue corns of Mexican and American origins were lime-cooked to obtain nixtamals with optimal moisture (48–50%) for tortillas and chips. Blue kernels had less bulk density, softer endosperm and, consequently, required less cooking time than the white kernels. The optimum cooking regime for the white kernels was 100°C for 20 min, while the optimum for both pigmented genotypes was 90°C for 0 min (until the lime-cooking solution reached 90°C). Doughs, tortillas, and chips were characterized by total soluble phenolics (TSP), anthocyanins (ACN), and antioxidant capacity (AOX). A dough acidification procedure using fumaric acid (pH 5.2) was assessed as a means to improve TSP, ACN, and AOX retention. The Mexican blue corn had higher AOX (16%) than the American blue genotype, although the latter had a threefold higher TSP content (12.1 g/kg, dwb). Mexican and American blue corns had higher AOX capacity (29.6 and 25.6 μM trolox equivalents [TE]/g dwb), respectively, than the white corn (17.4 μM TE/g). White corns did not have detectable amounts of ACN, while blue Mexican and American kernels contained 342 and 261 mg/kg. Lime cooking had the greatest negative impact on the stability of TSP, ACN, and AOX. However, the acidification reduced ACN, TSP, and AOX losses by 8–23, 3–14, and 4–15%, respectively. Similar ACN losses were observed for both types of blue kernels when processed into nixtamal/dough (47%); however, ACN losses in tortillas and chips manufactured from the American blue genotype were higher (63 and 81%, respectively) than those of Mexican blue corn products (54 and 75%). ACN losses were highly correlated to TSP (r = 0.91) and AOX capacity losses (r = 0.94).",1

"The fruits of nine white-fleshed and three yellow-fleshed peaches, one white-fleshed nectarine and five apricot cultivars were compared as to chemical composition and sensory evaluation. Three acids (succinic, malic and citric) and eight sugars (xylitol, fructose, glucose, mannose, sorbitol, inositol, sucrose and maltose) were identified. The total amount (mg/100g FW) of acids ranged from 300 to 1,500 in peach and from 2,900 to 4,600 in apricot. The total amount of sugars ranged from 6,700 to 12,500 and from 7,400 to 10,800 for peach and apricot respectively. Total phenolics were very variable, ranging from an average of 30 mg/100g FW in the yellow-fleshed peaches to values two-seven fold higher in the white ones and from 27 to 91 in apricots. According to the sensory and chemical evaluations conducted in this study, acceptable or good flavor should match the following composition (mg/100g FW). Peach: 1,000-1,600 organic acids, 8,500-13,000 alcoholsoluble sugars, 7.8-8.5 acid-sugar ratio; less than 80-90 phenolics. Apricot: 3,500-4,500 organic acids, 10-12,000 sugars, 2-3.5 sugar/acid ratio, less than 60 phenolics. The present study also suggests that sugar and acid patterns of fruit flesh may be useful in cultivar characterization.",1
"Lentils (Lens culinaris L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, little is known about their phenolic composition. Because polyphenols in lentils are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in this part of the tissue. The use of C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization (mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was (+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to nonamers constitute the polymer fraction. The most abundant proanthocyanidins in the seed coat of lentils are the polymers (65-75%), with a mDP of 7-9, followed by the oligomers (20-30%), with a mDP of 4-5.",1
"Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.",1
"The Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia InterContinental (ALL-IC) Study Group exemplifies the potential of broad international collaboration. Patient outcomes have improved by standardizing therapeutic options and employing flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease (MRD) for treatment stratification. Nevertheless, relapse occurs in 10%-20% of cases, with survival rates falling short of benchmarks set by top-tier published studies. We aimed to unify treatment guidelines for children with first relapse of ALL across the ALL-IC network, analyze post-relapse outcomes, and report findings from an observational registry. Patients were stratified as standard-risk (SR) or high-risk (HR) based on relapse features and genetics. HR criteria included T-cell immunophenotype, very early or early isolated bone marrow relapse, and relapse post-stem cell transplant (SCT). SR was assigned to all others. SCT was indicated in the whole HR group and in SR patients with poor responses (MRD ≥ 0.1% on Day 29). Among 370 patients (mean age 9 years; 33.2% female) diagnosed with first relapse between 2017 and 2021, 90.5% had received ALL-IC-Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) 2009 treatment initially. Upon relapse, 46.8% were classified as SR and 53.2% as HR. Complete remission rates post-induction were 84% (SR) and 56% (HR). MRD < 0.1% was achieved by 53% (SR) and 29% (HR). Five-year overall survival was 50.5% (74% SR, 32% HR). HR outcomes were hindered by disease progression, treatment toxicity, and posttransplant complications. This inaugural ALL-IC REL Consortium report demonstrates promising SR outcomes, akin to the International Study for the Treatment of Childhood Relapsed ALL (IntReALL) findings, but highlights poor HR outcomes with standard chemotherapy. Novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed in upcoming ALL-IC-BFM REL protocols.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapy remains to be investigated in T-cell malignancies. CD7 is an ideal target for T-cell malignancies but is also expressed on normal T cells, which may cause CAR-T cell fratricide. Donor-derived anti-CD7 CAR-T cells using endoplasmic reticulum retention have shown efficacy in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we launched a phase I trial to explore differences between autologous and allogeneic anti-CD7 CAR-T therapies in T-cell ALL and lymphoma. Ten patients were treated and 5 received autologous CAR-T therapies. No dose-limiting toxicity or neurotoxicity was observed. Grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 7 patients, and grade 3 in 1 patient. Grade 1-2 graft-versus-host diseases were observed in 2 patients. Seven patients had bone marrow infiltration, and 100% of them achieved complete remission with negative minimal residual disease within one month. Two-fifths of patients achieved extramedullary or extranodular remission. The median follow-up was 6 (range, 2.7-14) months and bridging transplantation was not administrated. Patients treated with allogeneic CAR-T cells had higher remission rate, less recurrence and more durable CAR-T survival than those receiving autologous products. Allogeneic CAR-T cells appeared to be a better option for patients with T-cell malignancies.",0
"The objective of this study was to discuss our experience performing LLIF in the prone position and report our complications. A retrospective chart review was conducted that included all patients who underwent single- or multi-level single-position pLLIF alone or as part of a concomitant procedure by the same surgeon from May 2019 to November 2022. A total of 155 patients and 250 levels were included in this study. Surgery was most commonly performed at the L4-L5 level (n = 100, 40%). The most common preoperative diagnosis was spondylolisthesis (n = 74, 47.7%). In the first 30 cases, 3 surgeries were aborted to an MIS TLIF. Complications included 3 unintentional ALL ruptures (n = 3/250, 1.2%), and 1 malpositioned implant impinging on the contralateral foramen requiring revision (n = 1/250, 0.4%), which all occurred within the first 30 cases. Out of 147 patients with more than 6-week follow-ups, there were 3 cases of femoral nerve palsy (n = 3/147, 2.0%). Two cases of femoral nerve palsy improved to preoperative strength by the 6th week postoperatively, while one improved to 4/5 preoperative strength by 1 year. There were no cases of bowel perforation or vascular injury. Our single-surgeon experience demonstrates the initial learning curve when adopting pLLIF. Thereafter, we experienced reproducibility in our technique and large improvements in our operative times, and complication profile. We experienced no technical complications after the 30th case. Further studies will include long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes to understand the complete utility of this approach.",0
"Wines have been studied a lot and several different groups of phenolic compounds have been analysed in wine samples, but lignans in wines have been only preliminary studied. In this study, we analysed 10 different wines of which eight were red wines and two white wines. Samples were selected among the most consumed wines in Finland in year 1999. Eight different lignans were analysed with HPLC using coulometric electrode array detector. The amount of lignans in red wines ranged from 0.812 to 1.406 mg/l. The main lignan in all studied wines was isolariciresinol and percentage amount of mammalian lignan precursors varied from 34 to 43% in the red wines. The amount of lignans was much lower in the studied white wines compared with the red wines.",1
"Acute leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells which progresses rapidly and aggressively. There are two types: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The latter has a rare subtype: acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). For some patients, following first-line treatment, remission is not achieved (""refractory disease""), and for others the leukemia returns after achieving remission (""relapse""). For these individuals, outcomes are typically poor. It is, therefore, important to understand patients' treatment priorities in this context. Building upon formative qualitative research, an online survey containing a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to explore patients' treatment preferences in the relapsed/refractory setting. The DCE attributes were mode of administration; quality of life during treatment; chance of response; duration of response; and quality of life during response. Each respondent completed twelve scenarios containing two hypothetical treatments. Participants were eligible if they lived in the United Kingdom and had a diagnosis of acute leukemia. The data were analysed using a latent class model. A total of 95 patients completed the survey. The latent class analysis identified two classes. For both, chance of response was the most important attribute. For class 1, every attribute was important, whereas for class 2, the only important attributes were quality of life (during treatment and response) and chance of response. A greater proportion of respondents would fall into class 1 overall, and those with ALL or APL and those more recently diagnosed were more likely to be in class 2. Our results indicate that patients are strongly concerned about the chance of response, as well as quality of life (to a lesser extent), when faced with different treatment options in the relapsed/refractory setting. However, there is significant preference heterogeneity within the patient population, and other treatment characteristics also matter to many.",0
"The coincidence of acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, NOS (T-ALL/LBL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is unusual, and there have only been a few cases of their metachronous occurrence. In these cases, PTCLs emerged as recurrence after primary therapy for primary T-ALL, were the rare gamma/delta type, and uncommonly involved skin for T-ALL/LBL. We herein report the first case of de novo T-LBL that coincided with cutaneous gamma/delta PTCL before primary therapy. A 70-year-old man presented with systemic lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy revealed a massive proliferation of lymphoblastoid cells; immunohistochemically, they were positive for TdT/CD1a/CD99, and cytoplasmic CD3ε, CD4, and CD8 and were negative for T-cell receptor (TCR) βf-1. A few TCRδ-positive cells were intermingled. Atypically, TIA was focally positive, whereas granzyme/perforin was negative. Multiple papules and plaques emerged on the trunk before the initiation of treatment for T-LBL. Skin biopsy revealed a massive proliferation of medium-to-large atypical lymphoid cells that were TdT/CD1a-negative mature T-cells; they were negative for TCRβf1 and CD4, and positive for TCRδ, CD5, CD8, CD56, TIA, granzyme B, and perforin. A conventional PCR analysis of TCRG showed no identical clonal band between the two tumors. The skin lesion was diagnosed as cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma. Whether the lesion was primary or a transformation of T-LBL was unclear. After treating with reduced hyper-CVAD/MA targeting T-LBL, molecular complete remission was achieved. When an uncommon cutaneous lesion emerges in the course of T-ALL/LBL, both need to be evaluated pathologically and genetically, whether de novo or recurrent, assuming the possibility of coincident gamma/delta PTCL.",0
"To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have biological effects.",1
"The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and restaurants.",1
"Leukemia is a group of blood cancers that are classified in four major classes. Within these four classes, many different subtypes exists with similar origin, genetic mutations, and level of maturity, which can make them difficult to distinguish. Despite their similarities, they might respond differently to treatment, and therefore distinguishing between them is of crucial importance. A deranged metabolic phenotype (Warburg effect) is often seen in cancer cells, leukemia cells included, and is increasingly a target for improved diagnosis and treatment. In this study, hyperpolarized",0
"CAR-T therapy has led to significant improvements in patient survival. However, a subset of patients experience high-grade toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune cell-associated hematological toxicity (ICAHT). We utilized IL-2Rα knockout mice to model toxicities with elevated levels of IL6, IFNγ, and TNFα and increased M1-like macrophages. Onset of CRS was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral blood neutrophils due to disruption of bone marrow neutrophil homeostasis characterized by an increase in apoptotic neutrophils and a decrease in proliferative and mature neutrophils. Both non-tumor-bearing and Eμ-ALL tumor-bearing mice recapitulated the co-occurrence of CRS and neutropenia. IFNγ-blockade alleviated CRS and neutropenia without affecting CAR-T efficacy. Mechanistically, a Th1-Th17 imbalance was observed to drive co-occurrence of CRS and neutropenia in an IFNγ-dependent manner leading to decreased IL-17A and G-CSF, neutrophil production, and neutrophil survival. In patients, we observed an increase in the IFNγ-to-IL-17A ratio in the peripheral blood during high-grade CRS and neutropenia. We have uncovered a biological basis for ICAHT and provide support for the use of IFNγ-blockade to reduce both CRS and neutropenia.",0
"The E2A-PBX1 gene fusion is a common translocation in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Patients harbouring the E2A-PBX1 fusion gene typically exhibit an intermediate prognosis. Furthermore, minimal residual disease has unsatisfactory prognostic value in E2A-PBX1 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, the mechanism of E2A-PBX1 in the occurrence and progression of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is not well understood. Here, we mainly review the roles of E2A and PBX1 in the differentiation and development of B lymphocytes, the mechanism of E2A-PBX1 gene fusion in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and the potential therapeutic approaches.",0
"We present the results of the first study on the impact of thermal processing and lyophilisation on three major micronutrient families: carotenoids, total polyphenols and vitamin C in two different tomato cultivars: a red tomato (RT) and a yellow one (YT). Micronutrients were analysed in fresh tomatoes, tomato purée and lyophilised tomatoes. YT contained no lycopene, lower β-carotene, similar vitamin C and higher total polyphenol contents than RT. Processing did not affect the carotenoid content in RT, but significantly lowered β-carotene in YT and also the contents of total polyphenol and vitamin C in both cultivars. Lyophilisation lowered the carotenoid content in RT but not in YT; in contrast, the total polyphenol content was preserved in RT but lowered in YT, and the vitamin C content was not affected in both cultivars. These results provide new data on the effect of thermal processing and lyophilisation on the content of the three main families of micronutrients in red and yellow tomatoes.",1
"Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone (M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), 5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A (M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic pathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its metabolic fate and disposition in humans.",1
"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the third leading cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity worldwide, with high prevalence and associated complications, and is often overlooked and undertreated. Research has shown that there is a profound lack of PAD-related knowledge and awareness; additionally, information sources are not often reliable and accessible. The objective of this scoping review was: (1) to identify and critically appraise instruments that measure patients' disease-related knowledge/awareness about PAD, and (2) to characterize the current state of knowledge/awareness levels among these patients. This systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Six databases (APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Ultimate, Embase, Emcare Nursing, Medline ALL and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched, and search strategies were developed utilizing the PICO framework. Potential studies of any methodological design were considered for inclusion through a snowball hand search. Data from the included articles were extracted by a reviewer, and the extraction accuracy was independently cross-checked by another author. The initial database search yielded 9832 records, of which sixteen studies (thirteen quantitative and three qualitative) were included. Only three questionnaires had their psychometric properties assessed. Questionnaire items focused on the following topics: definition/characteristics, risk factors/causes, treatment, complications, and personal issues regarding the perception/management of the disease. Overall, knowledge/awareness about PAD was low among patients. This study identified major gaps in PAD education, including the lack of availability of a validated measurement tool addressing all educational topics relevant to care and low knowledge/awareness of patients about their condition.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a cancer of the immune system. Approximately 20% of pediatric and 50% of adult T-ALL patients have refractory disease or relapse and die from the disease. To improve patient outcome new therapeutics are needed. With the aim to identify new therapeutic targets, we combined the analysis of T-ALL gene expression and metabolism to identify the metabolic adaptations that T-ALL cells exhibit. We found that glutamine uptake is essential for T-ALL proliferation. Isotope tracing experiments showed that glutamine fuels aspartate synthesis through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and that glutamine and glutamine-derived aspartate together supply three nitrogen atoms in purines and all but one atom in pyrimidine rings. We show that the glutamate-aspartate transporter EAAT1 (SLC1A3), which is normally expressed in the central nervous system, is crucial for glutamine conversion to aspartate and nucleotides and that T-ALL cell proliferation depends on EAAT1 function. Through this work, we identify EAAT1 as a novel therapeutic target for T-ALL treatment.",0

"Despite extensive literature describing the biological effects of polyphenols, little is known about their absorption from diet, one major unresolved point consisting of the absorption of the bound forms of polyphenols. In this view, in the present work we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from coffee, a common beverage particularly rich in bound phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Coffee brew was analyzed for free and total (free + bound) phenolic acids. Chlorogenic acid (5'-caffeoylquinic acid), a bound form of caffeic acid, was present in coffee at high levels, while free phenolic acids were undetectable. After alkaline hydrolysis, which released bound phenolic acids, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and high levels of caffeic acid were detected. Plasma samples were collected before and 1 and 2 h after coffee administration and analyzed for free and total phenolic acid content. Two different procedures were applied to release bound phenolic acids in plasma: beta-glucuronidase treatment and alkaline hydrolysis. Coffee administration resulted in increased total plasma caffeic acid concentration, with an absorption peak at 1 h. Caffeic acid was the only phenolic acid found in plasma samples after coffee administration, while chlorogenic acid was undetectable. Most of caffeic acid was present in plasma in bound form, mainly in the glucuronate/sulfate forms. Due to the absence of free caffeic acid in coffee, plasma caffeic acid is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid in the gastrointestinal tract.",1
"The transition from childhood to adolescence is associated with an increase in rates of some psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, a debilitating mood disorder. The aim of this systematic review is to update the evidence on the benefits and harms of screening for depression in primary care and non-mental health clinic settings among children and adolescents. This review is an update of a previous systematic review, for which the last search was conducted in 2017. We searched Ovid MEDLINE® ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL on November 4, 2019, and updated on February 19, 2021. If no randomized controlled trials were found, we planned to conduct an additional search for non-randomized trials with a comparator group. For non-randomized trials, we applied a non-randomized controlled trial filter and searched the same databases except for Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2015 to February 2021. We also conducted a targeted search of the gray literature for unpublished documents. Title and abstract, and full-text screening were completed independently by pairs of reviewers. In this review update, we were unable to find any randomized controlled studies that satisfied our eligibility criteria and evaluated the potential benefits and harms of screening for depression in children and adolescents. Additionally, a search for non-randomized trials yielded no studies that met the inclusion criteria. The findings of this review indicate a lack of available evidence regarding the potential benefits and harms of screening for depression in children and adolescents. This absence of evidence emphasizes the necessity for well-conducted clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of depression screening among children and adolescents in primary care and non-mental health clinic settings.

"We evaluated the absorbability of anthocyanins in humans and rats administered with a beverage prepared from an extract of the tuber of purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Cultivar Ayamurasaki), or with an anthocyanin concentrate. Two major anthocyanin components, cyanidin 3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) and peonidin 3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), were detected in the plasma and urine of both rats and humans by HPLC or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The plasma concentration of anthocyanins in humans reached a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, and the recovery of anthocyanins in the urine was estimated as 0.01-0.03%. These results indicate that acylated anthocyanins could be selectively absorbed after ingesting food.",1
"The prognosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adolescents and adults is poor, and recurrence is an important cause of their death. Changes of genetic information play a vital role in the pathogenesis and recurrence of ALL; however, the impact of molecular genetic mutations on disease diagnosis and prognosis remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore the frequency spectrum of gene mutations and their prognostic significance, along with the minimal residual disease (MRD) level and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), in adolescent and adult patients aged ≥15 years with ALL. The basic characteristics, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, MRD level, treatment regimen, and survival outcome of patients with untreated ALL (≥15 years) were collected, and the correlation and survival analysis were performed using the SPSS 25.0 and R software. This study included 404 patients, of which 147 were selected for next-generation sequencing (NGS). NGS results revealed that 91.2% of the patients had at least one mutation, and 67.35% had multiple (≥2) mutations. NOTCH1, PHF6, RUNX1, PTEN, JAK3, TET2, and JAK1 were the most common mutations in T-ALL, whereas FAT1, TET2, NARS, KMT2D, FLT3, and RELN were the most common mutations in B-ALL. Correlation analysis revealed the mutation patterns, which were significantly different between T-ALL and B-ALL. In the prognostic analysis of 107 patients with B-ALL, multivariate analysis showed that the number of mutations ≥5 was an independent risk factor for overall survival and the RELN mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for event-free survival. The distribution of gene mutations and the co-occurrence and repulsion of mutant genes in patients with ALL were closely related to the immunophenotype of the patients. The number of mutations ≥5 and the RELN mutation were significantly associated with poor prognosis in adolescent and adult patients with ALL.",0

"B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed in children in Saudi Arabia. Cytogenetic investigations, including karyotyping and FISH, are used to determine the incidence and prognostic significance of chromosomal abnormalities in B-ALL. However, in ALL, accurate identification of the morphology of chromosomes is sometimes not achieved. Flow cytometric DI may have the advantage of being technically fast, using either fresh or frozen samples to correctly stratify the patient into the appropriate risk group for treatment. In this study, we evaluated the reliability and validity of using fixed samples instead of fresh samples to determine aneuploidy in cancer cells using a DNA index. The results of the DNA index obtained by flow cytometry were compared with those of conventional cytogenetic analysis to validate the accuracy. Fixed samples (n = 72) from children diagnosed with B-ALL at King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh between 2017 and 2019 were investigated. The results showed strong and statistically significant positive correlation between DNAI-FCM and conventional cytogenetic analysis (",0
"Antioxidant activities of buckwheat seeds, dehulled seeds, hulls, straws and leaves were evaluated and compared with those of oats and barley. Schaal oven test at 70 °C with gravimetric indication and lard as the substrate was applied. Protection factors ranged from 1.3 to 8.0 and increased in the order: buckwheat straws < buckwheat hulls = oats <barley <buckwheat seeds <buckwheat dehulled seeds <buckwheat leaves. Methanol extract of buckwheat seeds showed higher antioxidant activity in comparison with petrolether extract, protection factors amounted to 2.9 and 1.9, respectively Total phenolics, rutin and tocol contents in tested samples were determined and related to the antioxidant activities. Statistically significant relationship between total phenolics content as well as rutin content and antioxidant activity of buckwheat material was observed (R2 = 0.987, P <0,002, R2 = 0.972, P<0.002, respectively) Significant correlation between tocol content and antioxidant activity was not found.",1
"Phytoestrogens are secondary plant metabolites that have received increasing attention for their bioactivity, in particular due to their structural and functional similarity to 17beta-estradiol. Although urinary and plasma phytoestrogens can be used as biomarkers for dietary intake, this is often not possible in large epidemiological studies or in the assessment of general exposure in free-living individuals. Accurate information about dietary phytoestrogens is therefore important, but there are very limited data concerning food contents. In this study was analyzed a comprehensive selection of tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils for their phytoestrogen content using a newly developed sensitive method based on LC-MS incorporating (13)C 3-labeled standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analyzed, although the contents in gin and bitter (beer) were below the limit of quantification (1.5 microg/100 g). Lignans were the main type of phytoestrogens detected. Tea and coffee contained up to 20 microg/100 g phytoestrogens and beer (except bitter) contained up to 71 microg/100 g, mainly lignans. As these beverages are commonly consumed, they are a main source of dietary lignans. The results published here will contribute to databases of dietary phytoestrogen content and allow a more accurate determination of phytoestrogen exposure in free-living individuals.",1
"Little information is available on the embryology of the structures that connect the lateral meniscus to its nearby structures (proximal tibia, fibular head, and popliteus tendon), which restrict lateral meniscal extrusion. To describe the menisco-tibio-popliteus-fibular complex (MTPFC)-conformed by the lateral meniscotibial ligament (LMTL), popliteofibular ligament, meniscofibular ligament, and the 2 popliteomeniscal ligaments (superior and inferior)-and anterolateral ligament (ALL) of the knee in human embryos/fetuses from weeks 9 to 37 of gestation. Descriptive laboratory study. The authors analyzed 36 formalin-fixed embryos/fetus knees, ranging between weeks 9 and 37 of gestation. All had normal external morphological characteristics. A microdissection was performed by meticulously searching the structures of the MTPFC and the ALL, their anatomic relationships, and their appearance over time. Histological sections were taken of the entire knee, the lateral meniscus, the ALL, and the LMTL to observe its structure from its early stages, junctions, and cellularity. In addition, the composition and orientation of the fibers were evaluated. The MTPFC was not found in the youngest knees (9 weeks). The ligaments of this complex could not be seen until week 11 of development. Moreover, the ALL was a consistent finding from the 13th week of development onward. All the ligaments of the MTPFC were seen between developmental weeks 11 and 16 in all the specimens. The histological results showed that the histology of the ALL showed dense connective tissue organized into thick bundles of collagen fibers in its central portion, with a parallel and undulating arrangement and the anterolateral capsule demonstrated 3 easily distinguishable layers corresponding to the fibrous membrane, the subsynovial membrane formed by loose connective tissue, and the synovial membrane. All the structures of the MTPFC were visualized from week 11, with the LMTL being the first to form. Moreover, the ALL was a consistent finding from week 13 of development onward. Understanding the embryological development of the MTPFC and the ALL of the knee is clinically relevant, as it can provide crucial insights into the pathogenesis of knee conditions and inform treatment strategies. By elucidating the timeline and characteristics of these structures' formation, clinicians can better diagnose and manage conditions affecting the lateral meniscus and related structures, ultimately improving patient outcomes and surgical interventions.",0
"Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.",1
"Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in flavanone excretion.",1
"Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a higher risk of height deficit and obesity. Data on Chinese pediatric ALL patients treated on chemotherapy only are limited. Changes in z scores for height and body mass index (BMI) from the diagnosis to 2 years after the initial of treatment were analyzed in 805 ALL patients diagnosed at Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. A significant reduction in height z-scores and increase in BMI z-scores were documented during treatment ( Chemotherapy leads to height deficit and BMI increase in pediatric ALL patients. Height deficit is more pronounced in children aged 8-13 years, BMI increases are more significant in younger children. High-risk patients are more prone to lower height and smaller BMI increases.",0
"Three strawberry cultivars (Dover, Campineiro, and Oso Grande), grown in the same commercial plantation, were harvested at the ripe stage and stored at 6, 16 and 25 °C, for 6 days. During this period, chemical composition and antioxidant activity were evaluated. Results showed an increase in total soluble sugars, anthocyanin and vitamin C contents, indicating that a new biosynthesis had taken place during storage. Low temperature negatively affected anthocyanin and vitamin C accumulation, and positively affected soluble sugars, while flavonols, ellagic acid and total phenolic contents remained almost the same or even decreased at all temperatures. Despite differences in anthocyanin content between varieties and its increase during storage (higher with increasing temperature), there was no difference in the antioxidant activity between cultivars, which decreased after harvesting, independently of the temperature of storage. Variations in the proportion dehydroascorbic acid/ascorbic acid (DHA/AA) showed that there were differences between cultivars concerning adaptation of the fruit to low temperatures. The data obtained here indicate that cold storage is an effective way to maintain strawberry quality, but a compromise between sensorial and nutritional values can be achieved at 16 °C, for all the cultivars.",1
"Chocolate and soluble cocoa powders are dietary sources of antioxidants. The literature reports antioxidant capacity (AC) derived from aqueous-organic extracts of cocoa polyphenols; however, the residue of these extracts contains appreciable amounts of nonextractable polyphenols (condensed tannins or proanthocyanidins), which may become bioactive antioxidants after colonic fermentation. The objective of this work was to determine the total AC of cocoa products including both extractable and nonextractable polyphenols. Three methods were used: ferric reducing/antioxidant power, 2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) cations’ free-radical scavenging capacity. With this last method, AC ranged from 42 to 79 and from 22 to 60 μmol Trolox per gram of sample for extractable and nonextractable polyphenols, respectively. Addition of milk reduces the AC of cocoa products by about 30%. On the other hand, it was estimated that cocoa products account for about 10% of the total AC of the Spanish diet.",1
"Glucosinolates, phenolic compounds and vitamin C were evaluated in two commercial and 12 experimental cultivars of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L var italica) grown under uniform cultural conditions. The predominant glucosinolates in all broccoli cultivars were 4-methylsulphinylbutyl glucosinolate (glucoraphanin) and 3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate (glucobrassicin). Other glucosinolates such as 4-OH-glucobrassicin and N-methoxyglucobrassicin were detected in lower amounts. The total glucosinolate concentration ranged from 3.0 µmol g−1 dw (dry weight) in Pentathlon (experimental cultivar) to 28.3 µmol g−1 dw in I-9905 (experimental cultivar). Flavonoids, caffeic acid derivatives and sinapic acid derivatives were quantified in methanol extracts. The largest content of flavonoids was found in the commercial cultivars Marathon and Lord, around 60 mg kg−1 fw (fresh weight). The vitamin C content of broccoli ranged from 43.1 mg per 100 g fw in Lord (commercial cultivar) to 146.3 mg per 100 g fw in SG-4515 (experimental cultivar).",1
"Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. Many of the demonstrated activities are consistent with favourable effects on the risk of chronic diseases. 4-O-methylgallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid are potential biomarkers of exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid is derived from chlorogenic acid in coffee. Our major objective was to explore the relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid in human subjects. The relationships of long-term usual (111 participants) and contemporaneously recorded current (344 participants) tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid were assessed in two populations. 4OMGA was related to usual (r 0.50, P<0.001) and current (r 0.57, P<0.001) tea intake, and isoferulic acid was related to usual (r 0.26, P=0.008) and current (r 0.18, P<0.001) coffee intake. Overall, our present results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker for black tea-derived polyphenol exposure, but isoferulic acid may be of limited usefulness as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.",1
"Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.",1
"Pediatric-inspired chemotherapy significantly improves survival for adolescent and adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the benefits over allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remain unclear. To compare clinical outcomes between pediatric-inspired chemotherapy and allo-HSCT in consolidation therapy of adolescent and adult Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-neg) ALL in first complete remission (CR1), related studies from MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials updated to July 2022 were searched. A total of 13 relevant trials including 3161 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with allo-HSCT, pediatric-inspired chemotherapy achieved better OS (hazard risk (HR), 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41 to 0.68) and DFS (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.86), with a significant reduction in NRM (risk ratio (RR), 0.30; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.51), but no difference in the relapse rate (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.39). When only studies based on intention-to-treat analysis were included, pediatric-inspired chemotherapy consistently conferred a survival advantage. In subgroup analyses, patients with baseline high-risk features demonstrated similar OS and DFS between pediatric-style chemotherapy and allo-HSCT, while pediatric-style chemotherapy had an OS and DFS advantage in standard-risk subgroup. Particularly, patients with positive minimal residual disease (MRD) achieved better OS and DFS if proceeded to allo-HSCT.",0
"A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of ascorbic acid.",1
"BCR-ABL is the oncogenic fusion product of tyrosine kinase ABL1 and a highly frequent driver of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The kinase activity of BCR-ABL is strongly elevated; however, changes of substrate specificity in comparison to wild-type ABL1 kinase are less well characterized. Here, we heterologously expressed full-length BCR-ABL kinases in yeast. We exploited the proteome of living yeast as an",0
"During treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), children are prone to musculoskeletal deterioration. However, non-invasive tools to measure muscle mass and intramuscular alterations are limited. In this study we explored the feasibility of muscle ultrasound in children with ALL. Additionally, we analysed whether automated ultrasound outcomes of muscle size and intramuscular fat infiltration (IMAT) were associated with appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM), muscle strength and physical performance. Children with ALL, aged 3-18 years were included during maintenance therapy. Bilateral images of the rectus femoris muscle were captured using a portable linear array transducer connected to a tablet. Subsequently, an automated image annotation software (MuscleSound) was used to estimate cross-sectional area, muscle thickness and IMAT. Feasibility was assessed using acceptance (percentage of children approached who were enrolled), practicality (percentage of children that completed the ultrasound measurement after enrolment) and implementation (percentage of children that had sufficient imaging to be processed and analysed by the software). Assessments of ASMM by bioimpedance analysis, muscle strength using handheld dynamometry and timed physical performance tests were administered at the same visit. Multivariable linear models were estimated to study the associations between muscle ultrasound outcomes and ASMM, strength and physical performance, adjusted for sex, age, body mass index and ALL treatment week. Muscle ultrasound was performed in 60 out of 73 invited patients (76.9%), of which 37 were boys (61.7%), and median age was 6.1 years (range: 3-18.8 years). The acceptance was 98.7%, practicality 77.9% and implementation was 100%. Patients who refused the examination (n = 13) were younger (median: 3.6, range: 3-11.2 years) compared with the 60 examined children (P = 0.0009). In multivariable models, cross-sectional area was associated with ASMM (β = 0.49 Z-score, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.3,2.4), knee-extension strength (β = 16.9 Newton [N], 95% CI: 4.8, 28.9), walking performance (β = -0.46 s, 95% CI: -0.75, -0.18) and rising from the floor (β = -1.07 s, 95% CI: -1.71, -0.42). Muscle thickness was associated with ASMM (β = 0.14 Z-score, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.24), knee-extension strength (β = 4.73 N, 95% CI: 0.99, 8.47), walking performance (β = -0.13 s, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.04) and rising from the floor (β = -0.28 s, 95% CI: -0.48, -0.08). IMAT was associated with knee-extension strength (β = -6.84 N, 95% CI: -12.26, -1.41), walking performance (β = 0.2 s, 95% CI: 0.08, 0.32) and rising from the floor (β = 0.54 s, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.8). None of the muscle ultrasound outcomes was associated with handgrip strength. Portable muscle ultrasound appears a feasible and useful tool to measure muscle size and intramuscular alterations in children with ALL. Validation studies using magnetic resonance imaging (gold standard) are necessary to confirm accuracy in paediatric populations.",0
"To evaluate whether tibiofemoral rotation is associated with a concurrent anterolateral ligament (ALL) injury and pivot-shift grading in patients with a primary anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. In this multicenter cross-sectional study constituting a secondary analysis of previous studies, medical records and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients with unilateral primary ACL injury were reviewed. Demographics and pivot-shift grading were collected. ALL was identified on MRI coronal images and categorized as intact or injured. Tibiofemoral rotation angle (TFA) was measured on axial MRI. Optimal TFA cut-off associated with ALL injury was identified by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Of 206 included patients, 152 (73.8%) exhibited signs of ALL injury. Pivot-shift tests were predominantly graded as 2 (71.4%), and notably, all Grade 3 pivot-shift assessments were associated with ALL injury. Mean TFA was significantly higher in cases with ALL injury (5.2 ± 3.6°) compared to intact ALL cases (2.7 ± 3.5°; p < 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between pivot-shift grading and TFA (r = 0.204, p = 0.003). Optimal TFA cut-off value, based on the absolute measurement, for predicting ALL injury was 2.5° (sensitivity: 0.77; specificity: 0.55). Patients with TFA ≥ 2.5° had a significantly higher risk of ALL injury (odds ratio: 3.34, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.74-6.42, p < 0.001); when combined with pivot-shift Grade 2 or 3, this risk substantially increased to 13.68 (95% CI: 6.29-29.84, p < 0.001). Higher TFA was associated with an increased prevalence of ALL injuries and a high-grade pivot-shift in ACL-deficient patients. Patients with a TFA ≥ 2.5° showed a threefold higher likelihood of ALL injuries, and this risk further escalated with a higher-grade pivot-shift. Level 3 cross-sectional study.",0
"This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found and identified in rat urine for the first time.",1
"The effects of microwave cooking and other traditional cooking methods such as boiling and autoclaving on the nutritional composition and anti-nutritional factors of lentils were studied. Cooking treatments causing decrease in carbohydrate fractions was completely eliminated after cooking treatments, antinutritional factors (trypsin inhibitor, tannins and phytic acid) and minerals. Cooking treatments decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. The losses in minerals in lentils cooked by microwaving were smaller than those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Based on these results, microwave cooking is recommended for lentil preparation, not only for improving nutritional quality, but also for reducing cooking time.",1
"The relationship among antioxidant activity, based on the electron-spin resonance determination of the reduction of Fremy's radical, vasodilation activity, and phenolic content was investigated in 16 red wines. The wines were selected to provide a range of origins, grape varieties, and vinification methods. Sensitive and selective HPLC methods were used for the analysis of the major phenolics in red wine: free and conjugated myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin; (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, caftaric acid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol, and trans-resveratrol glucoside. Total anthocyanins were measured using a colorimetric assay. The total phenolic content of the wines was determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay and also by the cumulative measurements obtained by HPLC. The 16 wines exhibited a wide range in the values of all parameters investigated. However, the total phenol contents, measured both by HPLC and colorimetrically, correlated very strongly with the antioxidant activity and vasodilation activity. In addition, the antioxidant activity was associated with gallic acid, total resveratrol, and total catechin. In contrast, only the total anthocyanins were correlated with vasodilation activity. The results demonstrate that the different phenolic profiles of wines can produce varying antioxidant and vasodilatant activities, which opens up the possibility that some red wines may provide enhanced health benefits for the consumer.",1
"Phenolic compounds in 46 Spanish cider apple varieties were determined by RP-HPLC with direct injection. Several pattern recognition procedures, including principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and partial least squares (PLS-1), were applied to the data in an attempt to classify the samples into bitter and nonbitter categories. Reliable decision rules were obtained by both LDA and PLS-1. LDA achieved 91.3 and 85.7% correct classification respectively, for internal and external evaluation of the model.",1
"The aim of this study was the qualitative and quantitative determination of free and bound phenolic compounds, mainly phenolic acids, in beer. In spite of the wide literature describing the content of free phenolic acids in beer, data concerning its content of bound forms are scarce or missing. Moreover, the experimental conditions commonly reported in the literature to detect bound phenolic acids by alkaline hydrolysis result in loss of several phenolic acids, particularly dihydroxy-derivatives. Recently, we described that the addition of ascorbic acid, a strong antioxidant, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, a metal chelator, totally prevents the loss of phenolic acids during alkaline hydrolysis. On this basis, we developed a hydrolytic procedure based on alkaline hydrolysis with 2 N NaOH containing ascorbic acid (1% w/v) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (10 mM). In these conditions, a complete recovery of caffeic acid (98.7±4.3% of expected value) following hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid (5′-caffeoylquinic acid, an ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid) was obtained. In the present study we took advantage of this hydrolytic procedure to quantitatively measure free and total (free plus bound) phenolic acids in beer. After alkaline hydrolysis, which released bound phenolic acids, a remarkable increase in the content of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid was observed in beer from three different brands. Our results show that the most of phenolic acids in beer are present as bound forms and only a small portion can be detected as free compounds.",1
"Nucleus segmentation and counting play a crucial role in many cell analysis applications. However, the dense distribution and blurry boundaries of nucleus make nucleus segmentation tasks challenging. This paper proposes a novel segmentation and counting method. Firstly, TC-UNet++ is proposed to achieve a global segmentation. Then, the distance watershed method is used to finish local segmentation, which separate the adhesion and overlap part of the image. Finally, counting method is performed to obtain information on the counting number, area and center of mass of nucleus. TC-UNet++ achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.95% for cell instance segmentation on the Data Science Bowl dataset, surpassing the original U-Net++ by 0.23%. It also showed a 5.09% improvement in counting results compared to other methods. On the ALL-IDB dataset, TC-UNet++ reached a Dice coefficient of 83.97%, a 7.93% increase over the original U-Net++. Additionally, its counting results improved by 16.82% compared to other approaches. These results indicate that our method has a more complete and reasonable nucleus segmentation and counting scheme compared to other methods.",0
"T-cell malignancies are highly aggressive hematological tumors with limited effective treatment options. CAR-NK cell therapy targeting CD7 has emerged as a promising approach for treating T-cell malignancies. However, conventional CAR-NK cell therapy faces the challenges of cell fratricide due to CD7 expression on both malignant cells and normal NK cells. Additionally, engineering CARs into human tissue-derived NK cells demonstrates heterogeneity, low transduction efficiency, and high manufacturing costs. The human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) were genetically modified by knocking out the CD7 gene and introducing the CD7 CAR expression cassette to generate CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-hPSCs. These modified hPSCs were subsequently differentiated into CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells using an efficient organoid induction method. The cytotoxicity of CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells against CD7 The CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-iNK cells derived from CD7 KO-CD7 CAR-hPSCs effectively avoided fratricide, demonstrated normal expansion, and exhibited potent and specific anti-tumor activity against CD7 Our study provides a reliable strategy for the large-scale generation of fratricide-resistant CD7 CAR-iNK cells with robust anti-tumor effects from hPSCs, offering a promising cell product to treat T-cell malignancies.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with granular blasts was historically referred to as ""granular ALL"", but this is not recognized as a distinct entity in the current WHO classification. This rare morphological feature is predominantly associated with a B-cell immunophenotype, while T-ALL with prominent cytoplasmic granules is extremely rare, with limited available genetic, molecular, and prognostic data. Here, we report a unique case of ALL in a 9-year-old girl. Initial blood tests revealed leukocytosis, and both peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology showed a high number of blasts with granular cytoplasm and bilobed nuclei. Immunophenotyping confirmed T-cell origin. The patient tested positive for KMT2A::AFDN, with WT1 overexpression, and NRAS and EZH2 mutations were detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Remarkably, the patient achieved complete remission after treatment and has shown no signs of relapse for nearly four years. Her favorable response to conventional therapy underscores the importance of molecular phenotyping in the treatment of this disease. The continued use of NGS to gather relevant molecular data is crucial for further understanding the molecular phenotype and prognosis of such atypical ALL cases.",0
"Overexpression of CD200 in ALL patients indicates that it may be useful in the characterization of leukemia initiating cells (LIC). We aim at investigating the expression pattern of CD200 on leukemic B cells and the correlation of CD200 expression with various clinical and laboratory findings in 62 newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. All patients were subjected to full history taking, a thorough clinical examination, and laboratory investigations, which included complete blood count (CBC), BM aspiration, immunophenotyping of blast cells, and CD200 expression. There is a higher statistically significant mean value of CD200 expression among the cases (66.15 ± 23.08) than the control group (0.37 ± 0.2) ( This study showed that CD200 expression was expressed in 100% of the patients. Correlations between CD200 expression and different laboratory data of patients revealed that there was an impact of CD200 on different diagnostic findings. After the follow-up of the patients, we found that the use of PRISM function of the software could add value to the detection of minimal residual disease.",0
"A total of 44 different berry and fruit wines and liquors with total phenolic contents between 91 and 1820 mg/L, expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE), were evaluated for antioxidant activity. Dealcoholized wine extracts were added to methyl linoleate (MeLo), and the oxidation in the dark at 40 degrees C was followed by conjugated diene measurement. Wines made of mixtures of black currants and crowberries or bilberries (240-275 µM GAE) were slightly superior to reference red grape wines (330-375 µM GAE) and equally as active as the control antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (50 µM), in inhibiting MeLo hydroperoxide formation. Also, raw materials including apple, arctic bramble, cowberries, cranberries, red currants, or rowanberries possessed antioxidant activity. Thus, these raw materials contain phenolic compounds, some of which are capable of protecting lipids against oxidation also in a hydrophobic lipid system. Liquors, apart from arctic bramble liquor, were less active than wines. However, the total phenolic content did not correlate with the antioxidant activity of the berry and fruit wines and liquors, therefore alleviating the importance of further characterization of the phenolic antioxidants present in berry and fruit wines.",1
"In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing products in the United States.",1
"The free phenols have been measured in 15 lagers, 6 porters and ales, and 11 light and nonalcoholic beers. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using an oxidation-reduction reaction with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and catechin as the standard. The order of phenol concentration was ales > lagers > low calorie > nonalcoholic. The quality of antioxidants of the major phenols in beers and the quality of beer antioxidants were measured by (1) dose-response inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation and (2) concentration of phenols in the beers at which 50% of the peroxide was destroyed in a luminescent assay for antioxidant activity. The beers' lipoprotein antioxidant quality was clearly superior to that of vitamin antioxidants and to that of the phenol ingredients, suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. The average per capita consumption of beer in the United States in 2000 was 225 mL/day, equivalent to 42 mg/day of catechin equivalents. Beer provides more antioxidants per day than wine in the U.S. diet. A dark beer and a lager beer were given at two concentrations to cholesterol-fed hamsters, an animal model of atherosclerosis. At the high dose ((1)/(2)-diluted beer) both lager and dark beer significantly inhibited atherosclerosis compared to a control of 2% alcohol. At the high dose, lager significantly decreased cholesterol and triglycerides, and both beers acted as in vivo antioxidants by decreasing the oxidizability of lower density lipoproteins. At the low dose ((1)/(10)-diluted beer) only the lager beer significantly decreased atherosclerosis compared to the 0.4% alcohol control. The polyphenols in the beers appear to be responsible for the benefits of beer in this model. Lager beer inhibited atherosclerosis at a human equivalent dose in this hamster model of atherosclerosis.",1
"Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.",1
"Peaches are tasty and juicy, with a unique flavor. The flavors of peaches always vary with cultivars. To investigate the physicochemical and aroma characteristics of peaches, the sugars, organic acids, total flavonoids, phenols, antioxidant activities, and aroma compounds of seven peach cultivars in Xinjiang were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HS-SPME–GC–MS). The results showed that sucrose (59.83 to 87.34%), malic acid (32.41 to 59.14%), and chlorogenic acid (10.43 to 45.50%) were the dominant sugar, organic acid, and phenolic compound in peaches, respectively. The antioxidant activity varied between 147.81 and 394.55 μmol TEs/100 g. The analysis of the aroma structure of peaches found that the volatile composition of peaches was relatively consistent, though the concentration of total aroma and certain separate compounds were different between cultivars. Meanwhile, the aroma fingerprint of the peaches consisted of hexyl acetate, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, γ-decalactone, n-hexanal, 2-hexenal, nonanal, decanal benzaldehyde and 6-pentylpyran-2-one, providing a clear green, sweet, floral, and fruity odor. These results provide complete information on the physicochemical properties, functional ingredients and aroma of the peaches.",1
"Precursor T-cell neoplasms (T-ALL/LBL) are aggressive hematological malignancies that arise from the malignant transformation of immature thymocytes. Despite the JAK/STAT pathway is recurrently altered in these neoplasms, there are not pharmacological inhibitors officially approved for the treatment of T-ALL/LBL patients that present oncogenic JAK/STAT pathway mutations. In the effort to identify potential therapeutic targets for those patients, we followed an alternative approach and focused on their transcriptional profile. We combined the analysis of molecular data from T-ALL/LBL patients with the generation of hematopoietic cellular models to reveal that JAK/STAT pathway mutations are associated with an aberrant transcriptional profile. Specifically, we demonstrate that JAK/STAT pathway mutations induce the overexpression of the PIM1 gene. Moreover, we show that the pan-PIM inhibitor, PIM447, significantly reduces the leukemogenesis, as well as the aberrant activation of c-MYC and mTOR pathways in cells expressing different JAK/STAT pathway mutations, becoming a potential therapeutic opportunity for a relevant subset of T-ALL/LBL patients.",0
"The concentrations of 11 phenols and 5 furans were measured in 12 categories of distilled spirits by HPLC methodology, together with the total antioxidant status (TAS) of the same beverages. Ellagic acid was the phenol present in highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a form of T-cell malignancy, is a typically aggressive hematological malignancy with high rates of disease relapse and a poor prognosis. Current guidelines do not recommend any specific treatments for these patients, and only allogeneic stem cell transplant, which is associated with potential risks and toxicities, is a curative therapy. Recent clinical trials showed that immunotherapies, including monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, and CAR T therapies, are successful in treating hematologic malignancies. CAR T cells, which specifically target the B-cell surface antigen CD19, have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of B-cell acute leukemia, and some progress has been made in the treatment of other hematologic malignancies. However, the development of CAR T-cell immunotherapy targeting T-cell malignancies appears more challenging due to the potential risks of fratricide, T-cell aplasia, immunosuppression, and product contamination. In this review, we discuss the current status of and challenges related to CAR T-cell immunotherapy for T-ALL and review potential strategies to overcome these limitations.",0
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy, accounting for 20-25% of all new cancer diagnoses in North American children each year. The leukemia arises, most commonly after a latency of 3-5 years, from a preleukemic B cell precursor population generated",0
"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is only indicated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients for whom other treatments are unlikely to be curative. However, outcomes of patients not in complete remission (CR) at HSCT remain very poor. To improve the outcomes of patients receiving HSCT, it is important to obtain detailed clinical information about patients with ALL receiving HSCT in CR and not in CR. Patients enrolled in the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study ALL-02 who underwent HSCT and were not in CR (non-CR patients, n = 55) were examined. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate of non-CR patients was 27.3%. Compared with CR patients, non-CR patients experienced very early and early relapse significantly more frequently and had poorer prognostic factors. Most interestingly, high hyperdiploid (HHD) patients showed an excellent 1-year OS of 80%. In addition, long-term survival among surviving HHD patients was longer than 5 years. All eight patients who survived after undergoing HSCT while not in CR were younger than 10 years at initial diagnosis and were negative for central nervous system involvement. While limited, these results suggest that a subset of patients may benefit from HSCT while not in CR.",0
"The alkylresorcinol (AR) content of 8 commonly consumed cereals, 125 Triticum cultivars, milling fractions of wheat and rye, bread, and other cereal products was analyzed. ARs were found in wheat (489-1429 microgram/g), rye (720-761 microgram/g), triticale (439-647 microgram/g), and barley (42-51 microgram/g), but not in rice, oats, maize, sorghum, or millet. One durum wheat variety was found to have an exceptionally low level of ARs (54 microgram/g) compared to other durum wheat varieties (589-751 microgram/g) and Triticumspecies analyzed. The AR content of milling fractions closely followed the ash content and could be used as a marker of the presence of bran in flour. Using hot 1-propanol extraction, all ARs could be extracted from bread, contrary to previous studies which suggested that ARs were destroyed during baking. Cereal products varied greatly in AR content, with those containing wheat bran or whole rye having the highest content.",1
"Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt (5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be carefully formulated.",1
"A method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseeds. The analytical method involves extraction of defatted flaxseed flour with dioxane/ethanol, aqueous base-hydrolysis, solid-phase purification of an SDG-containing fraction, and quantitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pure SDG was isolated from flaxseed using different column chromatographic methods and used, as external standard, for the calibration of the method and for quantification. The method was then applied to study the variation in SDG content in flaxseeds from 14 cultivars grown in Sweden and 15 cultivars grown in Denmark. The SDG content varied between 11.7 and 24.1 mg/g in defatted flaxseed flour and between 6.1 and 13.3 mg/g in whole flaxseeds.",1
"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) arises from B- or T-lineage lymphoid progenitors is the most common form of childhood cancer. This study aimed to develop a prognostic signature for overall survival (OS) in pediatric ALL patients. Pediatric ALL driver genes were used for LASSO-Cox regression to construct a prognostic model in a training cohort (GDC TARGET-ALL-P2, n = 103). The model's performance was assessed and validated in an independent cohort (GDC MP2PRT-ALL, n = 132). Thirteen genes out of 367 potential driver genes associated with ALL were selected for model construction. In the training cohort, the model has AUC values of 0.73, 0.89, and 0.832 at 365, 1,095 and 1,825 days, respectively. High-risk patients had significantly worse OS (hazard Ratio, HR = 10.87, 95% CI: 5.93-19.95, P < 0.001). In the invalidation cohort, it has an AUC value of 0.82 at 365 days and an HR of 3.048 (95% CI: 1.780-5.219, P < 0.001). This study identifies a 13-gene signature as a promising tool for risk stratification in pediatric ALL.",0
"The purpose of this systematic review of systematic reviews was to determine the cost-effectiveness of manual therapy in the management of patients with musculoskeletal disorders, with an assessment of methodological and reporting quality. To be included, publications needed to be systematic reviews including studies with participants with musculoskeletal conditions > 18 years old; the experimental intervention was manual therapy; assessed the cost of manual therapy; and were published in English. Literature, narrative, and scoping reviews were excluded. An electronic search was conducted in May 2024 using CINAHL (EBSCO Host), Ovid MEDLINE® ALL, the Cochrane Library, and Embase. The methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews was assessed using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020). Cost data was reported narratively. AMSTAR 2 and PRISMA compliancewas summarized narratively and graphically. Eleven systematic reviews were included. Approximately half of the reviews on spine pain concluded that manual therapy and acupuncture were cost-effective compared to usual care. A limited number of systematic reviews on peripheral joint pain concluded that manual therapy was cost-effective for shoulder pain, but was inconclusive for ankle fractures and knee osteoarthritis. Confidence in the results of the included reviews was low to critically low. Compliance with PRISMA guidelines was highly variable. Overall low to critically low methodological quality, variability in reporting quality, and heterogeneity of cost data makes it difficult to draw summative conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of manual therapy for patients with musculoskeletal conditions.",0
"Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid (cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer with resistant clonal propagation in recurrence. We performed high-throughput droplet-based 5' single-cell RNA with paired T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing of paired diagnosis-relapse (Dx_Rel) T-ALL samples to dissect the clonal diversities. Two leukemic evolutionary patterns, ""clonal shift"" and ""clonal drift"" were unveiled. Targeted single-cell DNA sequencing of paired Dx_Rel T-ALL samples further corroborated the existence of the 2 contrasting clonal evolution patterns, revealing that dynamic transcriptional variation might cause the mutationally static clones to evolve chemotherapy resistance. Analysis of commonly enriched drifted gene signatures showed expression of the RNA-binding protein MSI2 was significantly upregulated in the persistent TCR clonotypes at relapse. Integrated in vitro and in vivo functional studies suggested that MSI2 contributed to the proliferation of T-ALL and promoted chemotherapy resistance through the posttranscriptional regulation of MYC, pinpointing MSI2 as an informative biomarker and novel therapeutic target in T-ALL.",0
"A better knowledge of the effect of refrigerated storage on the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of foods processed by emerging technologies with regard to unprocessed juices is necessary. Thus, blueberry juice was processed by high pressure (HP) (600 MPa/42 °C/5 min) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) (36 kV/cm, 100 μs). The stability of physicochemical parameters, antioxidant compounds (ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total anthocyanins) and antioxidant capacity was studied just after treatment and during 56 days at refrigerated storage at 4 °C. Just after treatment, all treated blueberry juices showed a decrease lower than 5% in ascorbic acid content compared with the untreated one. At the end of refrigerated storage, unprocessed and PEF juices showed similar ascorbic acid losses (50%) in relation to untreated juice, although HP juices maintained better the ascorbic acid content during storage time (31% losses). All juices exhibited fluctuations in total phenolic values with a marked decrease after 7 days in refrigerated storage, however prolonged storage of the juices at 4 °C, up to 56 days resulted in another in the total phenolic content for all juices in comparison with day 7. HP preserved antioxidant activity (21% losses) more than unprocessed (30%) and PEF (48%) juices after 56 days at 4 °C. Color changes (a*, b*, L, Chroma, hº and ΔE) were slightly noticeable after refrigerated storage for all juices.",1
"L-asparaginase (ASNase) has played a key role in the management of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). As an amidohydrolase, it catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-asparagine, a crucial step in the treatment of ALL. Various ASNase variants have evolved from diverse sources since it was first used in paediatric patients in the 1960s. This review describes the available ASNase and approaches being used to develop ASNase as a biobetter candidate. The review discusses the Glycosylation and PEGylation techniques, which are frequently used to develop biobetter versions of the majority of the therapeutic proteins. Further, it explores current ASNase biobetters in therapeutic use and discusses the protein engineering and chemical modification approaches that were employed to reduce immunogenicity, extend protein half-life, and enhance protease stability of ASNase. Emerging strategies like immobilization and encapsulation are also highlighted as potential pathways for improving ASNase properties. The purpose of the development of ASNase biobetter is to achieve a novel therapeutic candidate that could improve catalytic efficiency, in vivo stability with minimum glutaminase (GLNase) activity and toxicity. Modification of ASNase by immobilization and encapsulation or by fusion technologies like Albumin fusion, Fc fusion, ELP fusion, XTEN fusion, etc. can be exploited to develop a novel biobetter candidate suitable for therapeutic approaches. This review emphasizes the importance of biobetter development for therapeutic proteins like ASNase. Improved ASNase molecules have the potential to significantly advance the treatment of ALL and have broader implications in the pharmaceutical industry.",0
"To help define the composition of commercial teas consumed in the United States, we have developed and validated an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method to analyze levels of catechins, theaflavins, and alkaloids in 77 commercial black, green, specialty (brown rice, white, oolong), and herbal teas extracted with hot water to simulate home use. The following 13 compounds were separated in a single analysis on an Inertsil ODS-3v column with acetonitrile/potassium dihydrogen phosphate as the mobile phase: (−)-epigallocatechin, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, (−)-gallocatechin-3-gallate, (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate, (−)-catechin-3-gallate, theaflavin, theaflavin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3′-gallate, theaflavin-3, 3′-digallate, caffeine, and theobromine. The data show that (1) extraction time from 3 min to 20 min did not significantly affect measured levels of tea compounds and (2) there was a wide variation in the composition of the tea compounds both within each tea category and among categories: black teas contained both theaflavins and catechins, green and white teas contained catechins and trace amounts of theaflavins, herbal teas contained very low amounts of all tea compounds. A statistical profile of the distribution of catechins, theaflavins, caffeine, and theobromine in the evaluated teas offers consumers a choice of teas containing high levels of health-promoting compounds.",1
"Immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) are both common adverse effects of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Blinatumomab is a commonly used CAR T-cell treatment in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Our patient presented with an extensive past medical history, including refractory B-ALL, and developed CRS and ICANS following treatment with blinatumomab CAR-T cell therapy. Early clinical detection of ICANS, monitoring using immune effector cell encephalopathy scores, following the appropriate protocol for ICANS grade, and adding anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) were crucial steps in managing his condition. The approach to managing and monitoring this patient was unique in that we added anakinra to the standard treatment regimen. With this report, we emphasize the need for further research regarding CAR T-cell therapeutic regimens and how to decrease the morbidity and mortality of its adverse effects.",0
"To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic model system.",1
"Seeds from different collections of cultivatedSesamum indicum Linn and three related wild species [specifically,S. alatum Thonn.,S. radiatum Schum & Thonn. andS. angustifolium (Oliv.) Engl.] were studied for their oil contents and fatty acid composition of the total lipids. The oils from wild seeds were characterized by higher percentages of unsaponifiables (4.9, 2.6 and 3.7%, respectively) compared toS. indicum (1.4–1.8%), mainly due to their high contents of lignans. Total sterols accounted forca. 40, 22, 20 and 16% of the unsaponifiables of the four species, respectively. The four species were different in the relative percentages of the three sterol fractions (the desmethyl, monomethyl and dimethyl sterols) and in the percentage composition of each fraction. Campesterol, stigmasterol, sitosterol and Δ5-avenasterol were the major desmethyl sterols, whereas obtusifoliol, gramisterol, cycloeucalenol and citrostandienol were the major monomethyl sterols, and α-amyrin, β-amyrin, cycloartenol and 24-methylene cycloartanol were the main dimethyl sterols in all species. Differences were also observed among the four species in sterol patterns of the free sterols compared to the sterol esters.Sesamum alatum contained less tocopherols (210–320 mg/kg oil), andS. radiatum andS. angustifolium contained more tocopherols (ca. 750 and 800 mg/kg oil, respectively) than didS. indicum (490–680 mg/kg oil). The four species were comparable in tocopherol composition, with γ-tocopherol representing 96–99% of the total tocopherols. The four species varied widely in the identity and levels of the different lignans. The percentages of these lignans in the oils ofS. indicum were sesamin (0.55%) and sesamolin (0.50%).Sesamum alatum showed 1.37% of 2-episesalatin and minor amounts of sesamin and sesamolin (0.01% each).Sesamum radiatum was rich in sesamin (2.40%) and contained minor amounts of sesamolin (0.02%), whereS. angustifolium was rich in sesangolin (3.15%) and also contained considerable amounts of sesamin (0.32%) and sesamolin (0.16%).",1
"A 56-year-old male presented to the clinic with complaints of multiple skin lesions. A complete blood count (CBC) was not available. No constitutional symptoms were present, and physical examination revealed tender skin lesions of the back, arms, legs, and scalp. A skin punch biopsy showed fragments of skin with extensive lymphoid infiltrates. The initial lymphoma workup by immunohistochemistry demonstrated negative staining for CD45, CD3, and CD20. Additional stains were performed which revealed the atypical lymphoid infiltrate to be positive for PAX5, TdT, CD10, CD34, CD79a, and CD99 and negative for CD4, CD8, Keratin, S100, CD56, CD138, and EMA. These histologic and immunophenotypic findings supported the diagnosis of skin involvement by B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL). Consequent peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy evaluations supported this diagnosis. To avoid misdiagnosis, it is important to remember that B-ALL/LBL can rarely present as a skin lesion and can be negative for the most commonly used lymphoma immunohistochemical markers: CD45, CD3, and CD20. Additionally, skin involvement by B-ALL/LBL, although very uncommon, is most often reported in children or young adults, unlike this unique case occurring in an adult.",0
"A method for determination of secoisolariciresinol, homovanillyl alcohol, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid in flax seed and nettle roots was developed. At first the naturally occurring esters and glycosides were cleaved by alkaline methanolysis (sodium methoxide) followed by enzymatic hydrolysis (cellulase) to get the aglycones. Then the compounds were isocratically separated (60 mM sodium acetate/ethanol/acetonitrile/glacial acetic acid =81:9:9:1, v:v:v:v, flow rate: 0.8 ml/min.) on a Spherisorb S-ODS 1 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, i.d, particle size: 5 µm) using 7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin as internal standard and detected at eight electrodes in a coulometric electrode array detector. The potentials of the 1st to the 5th electrode were set to +150 to +350 mV ( in increments of 50 mV), the potentials of the 6th to the 8th electrode were adapted from +550 to +750 mV (in increments of 100 mV) against modified palladium reference electrodes. In six flax seed samples secoisolariciresinol was found in the range from 5,000 to 10,000 µg/g and the content of p-coumaric and ferulic acid varied between 100 and 450 µg/g. In nettle roots the content of the lignan is about 10 times lower than in flax seed.",1
"In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of luteolin and luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat everted small intestine demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to luteolin. Free luteolin, its conjugates and methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. This suggests that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and the hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main conjugate which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the unchanged aglycone. Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed more rapidly than that in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma concentration of luteolin and its conjugates reached the highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin in propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the presence of free luteolin and its monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion of luteolin.",1
"Epicatechin is a flavan-3-ol that is commonly present in green teas, red wine, cocoa products, and many fruits, such as apples. There is considerable interest in the bioavailability of epicatechin after oral ingestion. In vivo studies have shown that low levels of epicatechin are absorbed and found in the circulation as glucuronides, methylated and sulfated forms. Recent research has demonstrated protective effects of epicatechin and one of its in vivo metabolites, 3'-O-methyl epicatechin, against neuronal cell death induced by oxidative stress. Thus, we are interested in the ability of ingested epicatechin to cross the blood brain barrier and target the brain. Rats were administered 100 mg/kg body weight/d epicatechin orally for 1, 5, and 10 d. Plasma and brain extracts were analyzed by HPLC with photodiode array detection and LC-MS/MS. This study reports the presence of the epicatechin glucuronide and 3'-O-methyl epicatechin glucuronide formed after oral ingestion in the rat brain tissue.",1
"Lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL/LBL), especially certain subtypes, continues to confer morbidity and mortality despite significant therapeutic advances. The pathologic classification of ALL/LBL, especially that of B-ALL, has recently substantially expanded with the identification of several distinct and prognostically important genetic drivers. These discoveries are reflected in both current classification systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) 5th edition and the new International Consensus Classification (ICC). In this article, novel subtypes of B-ALL are reviewed, including DUX4, MEF2D and ZNF384-rearranged B-ALL; the rare pediatric entity B-ALL with TLF3::HLF, now added to the classifications, is discussed; updates to the category of B-ALL with BCR::ABL1-like features (Ph-like B-ALL) are summarized; and emerging genetic subtypes of T-ALL are presented. The second half of the article details current approaches to minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) detection in B-ALL and T-ALL and presents anticipated challenges to current approaches in the burgeoning era of antigen-directed immunotherapy.",0
"Genomic alterations of IKZF1 are common and associated with adverse clinical features in B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The relationship between the type of IKZF1 alteration, B-ALL genomic subtype and outcome are incompletely understood. B-ALL subtype and genomic alterations were determined using transcriptome and genomic sequencing, and SNP microarray analysis in 688 pediatric patients with B-ALL in the St. Jude Total Therapy XV and 16 studies. IKZF1 alterations were identified in 115 (16.7%) patients, most commonly in BCR::ABL1 (78%) and CRLF2-rearranged, BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL (70%). These alterations were associated with 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of 14.8 ± 3.3% compared to 5.0 ± 0.9% for patients without any IKZF1 alteration (P < 0.0001). In separate multivariable analyses adjusting for genetic subtype groups and other factors, IKZF1 deletions of exons 4-7 (P = 0.0002), genomic IKZF1",0
"Treating Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in patients with genetic disorders poses significant challenges for onco-hematologists. Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (MPS-IVA) is a lysosomal storage disorder that clinically manifests with progressive and multi-systemic comorbidities, primarily affecting the bone, cartilage, spine, heart and lungs. We report a unique case of B-lineage ALL in a patient with MPS-IVA, who was successfully cured with a personalized chemo-radiotherapy approach. The treatment strategy aimed to balance a curative-intent chemotherapy attempt with the minimization of life-threatening complications. This case highlights the importance of individualized therapy in managing ALL in the context of complex comorbidities.",0
"The antioxidant polyphenols in cacao liquor, a major ingredient of chocolate and cocoa, have been characterized as flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidin oligomers. In this study, various cacao products were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC, and the profiles and quantities of the polyphenols present, grouped by molecular size (monomers to approximately oligomers), were compared. Individual cacao polyphenols, flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin), and dimeric (procyanidin B2), trimeric (procyanidin C1), and tetrameric (cinnamtannin A2) proanthocyanidins, and galactopyranosyl-ent-(-)-epicatechin (2alpha-->7, 4alpha-->8)-(-)-epicatechin (Gal-EC-EC), were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and/or HPLC/MS. The profile of monomers (catechins) and proanthocyanidin in dark chocolate was similar to that of cacao liquor, while the ratio of flavan-3-ols to the total amount of monomeric and oligomeric polyphenols in the case of pure cocoa powder was higher than that in the case of cacao liquor or chocolate.",1
"The food and agricultural products processing industries generate substantial quantities of phenolics-rich subproducts, which could be valuable natural sources of polyphenols. In oranges, the peel represents roughly 30% of the fruit mass and the highest concentrations of flavonoids in citrus fruit occur in peel. In this work we have carried out the characterisation and quantification of citrus flavonoids in methanolic extracts of bitter and sweet orange peels using CE–ESI–IT–MS. Naringin (m/z 579.2) and neohesperidin (m/z 609.2) are the major polyphenols in bitter orange peels and narirutin (m/z 579.2) and hesperidin (m/z 609.2) in sweet orange peels. The proposed method allowed the unmistakable identification, using MS/MS experiments, and also the quantification of naringin (5.1 ± 0.4 mg/g), neohesperidin (7.9 ± 0.8 mg/g), narirutin (26.9 ± 2.1 mg/g) and hesperidin (35.2 ± 3.6 mg/g) in bitter and sweet orange peels. CE coupled to MS detection can provides structure-selective information about the analytes. In this work we have developed a CE–ESI–IT–MS method for the analysis and quantification of main phenolic compounds in orange peels.",1
"Phenolic compounds were extracted from recently harvested or stored black Jamapa beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) that were subjected or not to thermal treatment. The beans studied were cropped in the same area and were from the same lot. The highest amount of condensed tannins (CT) was found in the seed coat of recently harvested beans [222.41 ± 16mg of (+)-catechin equivalents per gram of seed coat]. After 2 yof storage, the amount of CT dropped significantly [35.8 ± 3.4 mg of (+) -catechin equivalents per gram of seed coat]. Thermal treatment significantly reduced the amount of CT in whole beans by approximately 70%. The raw seeds contained 13.76 ±1.2 mg of (+)-cat-echin equivalents per gram of seeds and a portion of CT appeared in the broth [9.4 ± 0.1 mg of (+) -catechin equivalents per gram of lyophilized broth]. The antimutagenic activity of these extracted phenolic compounds was tested against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the Kado microsuspension assay. Newly harvested beans showed higher antimutagenic activity against AFB1 mutagenicity than stored beans. The results suggest that to take the maximum advantage of components with biological activity present in beans, they must be used fresh.",1
"A highly sensitive cathodic stripping voltammetric method for the determination of naringin is presented. It is based on the formation and accumulation of two naringin–mercury complexes at the electrode surface, followed by reduction of the surface species during a differential pulse voltammetric scan. The cathodic stripping responses at −0.25V and −0.42V, are evaluated with respect to various experimental conditions, such as composition and pH of the supporting electrolyte, naringin concentration, accumulation potential and preconcentration time. The new method is suitable for the determination of naringin concentrations between 0.1mgl−1 (1.72×10−7moll−1) and 40mgl−1 (6.88×10−5moll−1). A 3σ limit of detection of 32μgl−1 (55nmoll−1) can be reached. The relative standard deviation (r.s.d.) is <1.5%. Recovery experiments yielded a mean recovery of 97% (r.s.d.=4.1%). The application of the procedure to the selective determination of naringin in grapefruit juice is demonstrated.",1
"Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.",1
"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) is an anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugate that was first evaluated in B-cell lymphomas but was subsequently shown to be highly effective in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). INO improved response rates and survival in a randomized study in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL, leading to its regulatory approval in the United States in 2017. While the formal approval for INO is as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory ALL, subsequent studies with INO administered in combination with chemotherapy and/or blinatumomab both in the frontline and salvage settings have yielded promising results. In this review, we discuss the clinical development of INO in ALL, highlighting lessons learned from the initial clinical trials of INO, as well as the many ongoing studies that are seeking to expand the role of INO in ALL.",0
"Ph-like ALL has gene expression profile similar to Ph-positive ALL but without the BCR::ABL1 fusion. The disease presents higher rates of severe clinical features and is associated with unfavorable outcomes. There is still no standard pipeline for molecular characterization of the disease, and no valid predictor gene panel is available worldwide. We performed expression microarray on 25 B-cell ALL and 6 Ph-positive B-cell ALL to cluster and identify the transcriptional signature of Ph-like ALL. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the expression of candidate genes. Four out of 25 samples (16%) shared gene expression signatures related to and clustered with control Ph-positive samples. Analysis of genes differentially expressed in Ph-like B-cell ALL and evidentially functional in normal blood cell development and leukemogenesis, we selected genes as potential biomarkers for Ph-like B-cell ALL in our dataset: ADGRE2, CD9, EPHA7, FAM129C, TCL1A, and VPREB1. Those genes were filtered by Ph-like gene signatures obtained from distinct reliable data, resulting in five genes, CA6, CHN2, JAK1, JCHAIN, and PON2, selected for validation by qRT-PCR. The Ct values of genes, including CA6 (p = 0.0017), PON2 (p = 0.0210), TCL1A (p = 0.0064), and VPREB1 (p = 0.0338), were significant in Ph-like ALL. GSEA analysis identified VPREB1 as enrichment in the KRAS signaling pathway, and several genes that interact with VPREB1 were reported as critical molecules involved in the leukemogenesis of B-cell ALL. In summary, we demonstrate using a gene expression microarray for classifying Ph-like B-cell ALL and highlight VPREB1 as a potential biomarker for this disease.",0
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of a citrus flavonoid, naringin, as its glycosylated form. Six healthy volunteers (three males and three females) were studied. After a single oral administeration of 500 mg of naringin, intact naringin was isolated from 2−4 h urine. Isolated naringin was identified by the LC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), MS/MS, and MS/MS/MS techniques. The cumulative urinary excretion of naringin and its metabolites (naringenin and naringenin glucuronides) was determined by HPLC for 0−24 h. Approximately 0.02% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as unchanged naringin, whereas urinary recoveries of naringenin and naringenin glucuronides were approximately 0.4 and 3.6% of the administered dose, respectively. It was concluded that trace amounts of orally administered naringin can be absorbed as the glycoside. However, it is not clear whether the glycoside is cleaved before or after absorption to generate naringenin.",1
"CD7 targeted CAR-T has demonstrated potential in the treatment of T cell malignancies but no study has been reported about its potential in the prophylaxis of GVHD in allo-HSCT. Here we reported a special case that a boy diagnosed with refractory acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) was treated with universal CD7 targeted CAR-T (CD7 UCAR-T) and parent-derived peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs). Complete remission and full engraftment of donor was observed. In the later four months of follow-up, in the absence of any immunodepression treatment, no signs of GVHD were observed. This case initially demonstrates the potential of CD7 UCAR-T in the prophylaxis of GVHD.",0
"The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide (medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 (0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l (14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin glucuronide. The median and range values for mean residence time were 3.3 (1.5-9.3), 2.8 (0.8-11.2) and 8.0 (2.3-13.1) h for naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, respectively. The results of the present study demonstrate the absorption of grapefruit flavanones via the presence of their metabolites in plasma, thus making an important contribution to the field since the biological activities ascribed to these compounds rely on their specific forms of absorption.",1

"The stability of three strawberry cultivars was evaluated for changes in jam color quality during processing and storage at 20°, 30° and 37°C for 200 days. Anthocyanin content was determined by HPLC. The effect of cultivar, processing and storage on jam pigments, instrumental color (L*, a*, b*) and consumer preference were also determined. ‘Oso grande’ jam had the lowest anthocyanin concentration (110 mg/g f.w), higher monomeric pigment degradation during processing and storage, highest pH, least desirable color score from the sensory panel and shortest shelf-life. Similarities were found between jams prepared with ‘Chandler'and Tudla’ cultivars, as well as initial differences in total anthocyanin concentrations (195 and 130 mg/g f.w.).",1
"Adolescent and young adults (AYAs) belong to a unique category of patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a leading cause of treatment-related mortality in ALL patients. However, the epidemiology and risk factors for mortality from BSIs in AYA patients remain unclear. In this study, we analysed these aspects in AYAs patients and compared similarities and differences with children (<15 years old) and older adults (>39 years old). We analysed the pathogenic epidemiology, antibiotic resistance and BSI risk factors of 73 children, 180 AYAs, and 110 older adults with ALL in three comprehensive hospitals from January 2010 to August 2021. The data on BSIs in AYAs were compared to that of the other two groups. In this study, the epidemiology of BSIs in AYAs was similar to that of older adult patients. Concerning clinical characteristics, most AYAs and older adults with BSIs were in a relapsed or uncontrolled state (34.5% vs. 35.4%, p = 0.861). In terms of pathogen distribution, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were the most common causative pathogens in AYAs and older adult groups. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria were more commonly found in AYAs than in children (32.8% vs. 16.4%, p = 0.09). Regarding risk factors, the length of hospitalization (>14 days) and renal inadequacy (creatinine ≥ 177 μmol/L) were influencing factors for 30-day mortality in AYAs patients with BSIs. In our study, AYA patients with BSIs showed clinical characteristics and pathogen distributions similar to those of older adult patients but quite different from those of children.",0
"Contents of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxycinnamic esters, and monomeric and dimeric derivatives of flavan-3-ol during biological aging of dry pale sherry white wine were measured and compared between wine without aging and wines in five different stages of aging. The results show a significant decrease in the levels of vanillic and ferulic acids, catechin, epicatechin and procyanidins B2 and B4, as well as an increase in those of syringic acid and procyanidin B1. According to the changes observed in polyphenol contents and the absorbance data obtained at 420 nm, sherry-type wines seem to be protected from excessive browning during biological aging mainly as a result of the partial removal of flavan-3-ol derivatives, besides the effect of protection from air contact carried out by the flor yeasts growing on the wine surface.",1
"Cross-lineage expression of the myeloid-associated antigens CD13/CD33 is common in adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients, yet its prognostic value is still controversial. We conducted a retrospective study of 1005 de novo adult B-ALL patients from January 2009 to December 2019 in our hospital. Logistic and Cox regression were used to analyze the prognostic value of CD13/CD33 expression in B-ALL. A Cox regression model was established to predict overall survival (OS) for B-ALL patients. Of the 1005 B-ALL patients, 53.7% (n = 540) aberrantly expressed CD13/CD33 (CD13/CD33 In real-world practice, CD13/CD33 expression can predict the risk of MRD in patients without TKI experience, but has no adverse effect on the prognosis of adult B-ALL patients. Incorporating CD13/CD33 into the standard antibody panels of B-ALL diagnosis and MRD measurements can help predict relapse risk and decisions on therapy options.",0
"The quality characteristics and composition of sesame oils prepared at different roasting temperatures (160–250°C) from sesame seeds using a domestic electric oven were evaluated as compared to an unroasted oil sample: only minor increases (P<0·05) in characteristics, such as peroxide value, carbonyl value, anisidine value and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, of sesame oils occurred in relation to increasing roasting temperature and time between 160 and 200°C, but colour units of oils increased markedly over a 220°C roasting temperature. Significant decreases (P<0·05) were observed in the amounts of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in the oils prepared using a 250°C roasting temperature. The amounts of γ-tocopherol and sesamin still remained over 80 and 90%, respectively, of the original levels after roasting at 250°C. In the oil prepared using a 250°C roasting temperature, sesamol was detected at 3370 mg per kg oil, but sesamolin was almost depleted after 25 min of roasting. Burning and bitter tastes were found in the oils prepared at roasting temperatures over 220°C. The results suggested that a high-quality product would be obtained by roasting for 25 min at 160 or 180°C, 15 min at 200°C and 5 min at 220°C when compared with the other samples",1
"In order to assess the effect of genotype, location and their interaction on total phenolic content (TPC) of chemical extracts, the whole grains of durum and soft wheat, oat, barley and triticale were evaluated. Data showed differences in phenolic content of chemical extracts among cereal species and the analysis of variance confirmed the key role of location. Besides TPC and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values assessed by chemical extraction were compared with those obtained with an in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction. Differences were found between methanolic and enzymatic extracts, and data confirmed that enzymatic technique enhanced extraction of antioxidants but pointed out lesser differences among cereal types. The breads obtained by flours enriched with different levels of bran were also evaluated. Chemical extracts highlighted the increasing levels of antioxidants according to bran enrichments, without pointing out changes caused by baking. The enzymatic extraction instead did not show differences regarding to bran enrichments, but documented a loss in antioxidant properties of breads in respect to corresponding flours. On the other hand the scarce differences between flours and corresponding breads did not allow asserting that baking modified the TPC and TEAC, independently of the extraction methods used. Indeed, during baking process, also the observed phenolic acids profile variations did not vary the antioxidant properties of breads.",1

"Seeds from various strains of cultivated Sesamum indicum Linn (colour of seeds: black, brown and white) were exposed to microwave roasting for 16 and 30 min at a frequency of 2450 MHz and were studied not only for different acyl lipids and their fatty acid compositions, but also for the contribution of antioxidants to the oxidative stability of the oils. Lipids from all-seeded strains were comparable in their total fatty acid composition, with linoleic, oleic, stearic and palmitic acids as the major acids. The total lipids were isolated by thin-layer chromatography into the following five fractions: triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerols, free fatty acids, polar lipids and steryl esters. The TAG were slightly and randomly hydrolysed by microwaves, but was still representing 900 g kg-1 of the total lipids at 30 min off roasting. Although burning and bitter tastes occurred at the time, the tocopherols and lignans still amounted to over 80% of the original level. The results suggested that the oxidative stability of the oils would probably be due to the synergism between endogenous antioxidants and browning substances produced during microwave roasting.",1
A new approach to the error sources in the spectrophotometric determination of total phenols in foods has been performed. The choice of the suitable phenolic standard and the influence of sugars and proteins as interfering compounds were carefully studied. The results obtained by the spectrophotometric method were compared with those found from the chromatographic method which was taken as reference method because it was free of interferences. The spectrophotometric method overestimates the phenolic content except in some fruit samples with a high polyphenolic content. Sugars did not show interference whereas protein showed a high influence on the total phenols at the concentration ranges found in the extracts. In green bean samples both methods gave the same total phenols when the interference was masked. This fact could constitute an useful way to find the real content of phenolics in foods.,1
"Whether steroid response is an independent risk factor for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between response to dexamethasone and prognosis in children with ALL. We analyzed the data of 5,161 children with ALL who received treatment in accordance with the Chinese Children's Cancer Group ALL-2015 protocol between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, in China. All patients received dexamethasone for 4 days as upfront window therapy. Based on the peripheral lymphoblast count on day 5, these patients were classified into the dexamethasone good response (DGR) and dexamethasone poor response (DPR) groups. A peripheral lymphoblast count ≥1× 10 The age, white blood cell counts, prevalence of the Response to dexamethasone was associated with an early treatment response in our study. In the intermediate-risk group, dexamethasone response added a prognostic value in addition to minimal residual disease, which may direct early intervention to reduce the relapse rate.",0
"The effects of different cooking methods (boiling, frying and microwave cooking) on the antioxidant activity of some selected vegetables (peas, carrot, spinach, cabbage, cauliflower, yellow turnip and white turnip) were assessed by measuring the total phenolic contents (TPC), reducing power and percentage inhibition in linoleic acid system. TPC (gallic acid equivalents g/100 g of dry weight) and reducing power of the methanolic extracts of raw-, microwaved-, boiled- and fried vegetables ranged 0.333–2.97, 0.52–2.68, 0.48–2.08, 1.00–2.02 and 0.391–2.24, 0.822–1.10, 0.547–1.16, 0.910–4.07, respectively. The level of inhibition of peroxidation ranged 71.4–89.0, 66.4–87.3, 73.2–89.2 and 77.4–91.3%, respectively. Antioxidant activity of the vegetables examined was appreciably affected because of varying cooking treatments. TPC of vegetables, generally, decreased by boiling, frying and microwave cooking. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in reducing power as a result of frying. However, boiling and microwave cooking did not affect reducing power. Inhibition of peroxidation increased by boiling and frying, whereas, in contrast it was decreased by microwave cooking. The results of the present investigation showed that all the cooking methods affected the antioxidant properties of the vegetables; however, microwave treatment exhibited more deleterious effects when compared with those of other treatments. Thus an appropriate method might be sought for the processing of such vegetables to retain their antioxidant components at maximum level.",1
"This study delves into the clinical implications of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 (CDKN2) deletion in adult T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Among 241 patients included in this study, 57 had CDKN2 deletion and 184 had CDKN2 wild-type (WT), and 165 underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and 76 did not undergo allo-HSCT. CDKN2 deletion correlated with higher white blood cell count, more high-risk diseases, and complex karyotype. The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 36.8% and 58.2% (P < 0.001), 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 47.1% and 59.3% (P = 0.018), and 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 33.7% and 22.3% (P = 0.019) in patients with CDKN2 deletion and WT, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified CDKN2 deletion as an independent adverse prognostic factor for OS (HR 2.11, P = 0.003). In the CDKN2 deletion subgroup, landmark analysis showed that the 5-year OS was 56.7% and 19% (P = 0.002) for patients who underwent allo-HSCT and those who did not, respectively. And multivariate analysis confirmed the beneficial role of allo-HSCT in OS (HR 0.23, P < 0.001). In conclusion, CDKN2 deletion was associated with a poor prognosis in adult T-ALL, and allo-HSCT might be beneficial for this population.",0
"Clinical trials with a solid strategy are indispensable for improving outcomes of rare childhood leukemias such as infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and ALL associated with Down syndrome, and international collaboration contributes to trial success. I am part of a group conducting an international trial of ALL associated with Down syndrome in collaboration with Asian countries. Although we are meeting enrollment targets, there have been no enrollments outside Japan. We also planned a clinical trial in unclassifiable acute leukemia, but abandoned this effort due to a lack of consensus on the choice of treatment regimen. Many elements must fit together for an international trial to succeed, including not only the study's concept, theme, and objectives, but also the organization, the logistics, and, ultimately, trained professionals to carry it out. At the same time, of course, there is the need for appropriate timing and luck. International trials across countries with different cultures, social organizations, and medical systems require persistent effort and negotiation skills. Professional training and infrastructure development are necessary to make this possible.",0
"Less than 5% of the DNA sequence encodes for proteins, and the remainder encodes for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Among the members of the ncRNA family, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a pivotal role in the insurgence and progression of several cancers, including leukemia. Thought to have different molecular mechanisms, both miRNAs and lncRNAs act as epigenetic factors modulating gene expression and influencing hematopoietic differentiation, proliferation and immune system function. Here, we discuss the most recent findings on the main molecular mechanisms by which miRNAs and lncRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of pediatric T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), pointing out their potential utility as therapeutic targets and as biomarkers for early diagnosis, risk stratification and prognosis. miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, acting both as tumor suppressors and as oncomiRs. By contrast, to the best of our knowledge, the literature highlights lncRNAs as acting only as oncogenes in this type of cancer by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting cell cycle and drug resistance. Additionally, here, we discuss how these molecules could be detected in the plasma of T-ALL patients, highlighting that lncRNAs may represent a new class of promising accurate and sensitive biomarkers in these young patients. Thus, the unveiling of the aberrant signature of circulating and intracellular levels of lncRNAs could have great clinical utility for obtaining a more accurate definition of prognosis and uncovering novel therapeutic strategies against T-ALL in children. However, further investigations are needed to better define the standard methodological procedure for their quantification and to obtain their specific targeting in T-ALL pediatric patients.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 25% of childhood cancers and 20% of leukemia cases in adults, with a higher prevalence in males than females. It is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and bone pain and poses a significant risk of mortality if left untreated. While chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation are standard treatments, their efficacy declines in relapsed or refractory cases, highlighting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. CAR T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative technology, offering the potential to overcome these challenges and deliver durable remissions. CAR T-cell therapy demonstrates significant advantages, including targeting specific antigens, overcoming high-risk genetic mutations, and achieving sustained remissions in both pediatric and adult patients. However, notable challenges remain, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). In this review, we focus on neurological symptoms associated with CAR T-cell therapy in treating ALL and discuss current and future strategies aiming at reducing their risk.",0

"Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species (Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of natural antioxidants for foods.",1
"The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice (WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid (PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.",1
"Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).",1
"Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators are commonly observed at relapse in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Loss-of-function mutations in SETD2, an H3K36 methyltransferase, have been observed in B-ALL and other cancers. Previous studies on mutated SETD2 in solid tumors and acute myelogenous leukemia support a role in promoting resistance to DNA damaging agents. We did not observe chemoresistance, an impaired DNA damage response, nor increased mutation frequency in response to thiopurines using CRISPR-mediated knockout in wild-type B-ALL cell lines. Likewise, restoration of SETD2 in cell lines with hemizygous mutations did not increase sensitivity.",0
"The translocation t(1;19)(q23;p13) with the resulting chimeric TCF3::PBX1 gene is the third most prevalent recurrent chromosomal translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and accounts for 3-5% of cases. The molecular background of this translocation has been incompletely studied, especially in adult cases. We characterized the chromosomal breakpoints of 49 patients with TCF3::PBX1 and the corresponding reciprocal PBX1::TCF3 breakpoints in 15 cases at the molecular level, thus providing an extensive molecular overview of this translocation in a well-defined study patient population. Breakpoints were found to be remarkably clustered not only in TCF3 but also in PBX1. No association with DNA repeats or putative cryptic recombination signal sequence sites was observed. A simplified detection method for breakpoint identification was developed and the feasibility of patient-specific chromosomal break sites as molecular markers for detecting measurable residual disease (MRD) was explored. A highly sensitive generic real-time PCR for MRD assessment using these breakpoint sequences was established that could serve as a useful alternative to the classical method utilizing rearranged immune gene loci. This study provides the first extensive molecular data set on the chromosomal breakpoints of the t(1;19)/TCF3::PBX1 aberration in adult ALL. Based on the obtained data a generic MRD method was developed that has several theoretical advantages, including an on average higher sensitivity and a greater stability of the molecular marker in the course of disease.",0
"The role of haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) ETV6/RUNX1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unclear. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors and explore the role of haplo-HSCT in the treatment of ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL. We analyzed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of 20 pediatric patients who were diagnosed with ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL and received chemotherapy/chimeric antigen receptor T-cell bridged to haplo-HSCT between 2016 and 2021 at our institution. With a median follow-up time of 47 months, the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse, disease-free survival, and overall survival were 35.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 15.3-57.1%), 59.1% (95% CI: 37.2-81.0%), and 75.0% (95% CI: 56.0-94.0%), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pre-HSCT measurable residual disease (MRD) positivity (hazard ratio, 13.275; 95% CI: 2.406-73.243; p = 0.003) had a significant negative impact on relapse. A total of 7 patients experienced positive ETV6/RUNX1 gene expression at a median of 7.2 months after haplo-HSCT, and 5 of them experienced relapse at a median time of 12.1 months after haplo-HSCT. ROC curve analysis was performed to analyze the significance of pre-HSCT and post-HSCT ETV6/RUNX1 transcripts for predicting relapse; the AUC were 0.798 (95% CI: 0.567-1.0, p = 0.035) and 0.875 (95% CI: 0.690-1.0, p = 0.008), respectively. The optimal cut-off points to predict an inevitable relapse were 0.011% and 0.0019%, respectively. Patients with R/R ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL may benefit from haplo-HSCT. Deeply eliminating pre-HSCT MRD and preemptive treatment for post-HSCT MRD may be crucial to further improving the prognosis.",0
"To investigate the correlation between single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of A total of 144 children with ALL who were treated in General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from January 2015 to November 2021 were enrolled and divided into MTX resistant group and non-MTX resistant group, with 72 cases in each group.

"Methotrexate (MTX)-induced leukoencephalopathy is a significant neurological complication in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive method to assess metabolic changes associated with neurotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MRS-derived metabolite levels, particularly N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (tNAA), in MTX-induced leukoencephalopathy. We retrospectively analyzed 89 pediatric patients with ALL who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRS at Kanagawa Children's Medical Center between 2009 and 2022. A total of 261 MRS datasets were examined, focusing on metabolic changes in the centrum semiovale. Using mixed logistic regression, we evaluated the association between tNAA levels and leukoencephalopathy onset, as well as their correlation with clinical recovery after MTX discontinuation. Patients with leukoencephalopathy had significantly lower tNAA levels than those of controls. A predictive model indicated that a 1.0-point decrease in pretreatment tNAA levels was associated with an approximately 3.22-fold increase in the odds of developing MTX-induced leukoencephalopathy. Furthermore, increasing tNAA levels over time were significantly correlated with clinical improvement. This study suggests that tNAA levels measured using MRS may serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and monitoring MTX-induced leukoencephalopathy. Integrating MRS into clinical assessments may represent a promising future approach to facilitate earlier intervention, inform treatment strategies, and potentially improve patient outcomes, pending validation by future prospective studies. These findings highlight the importance of MRS in the real-time evaluation of disease progression and therapeutic responses in pediatric patients undergoing MTX treatment.",0
"To analyze the gene mutation profile in children with acute lymphocyte leukemia (ALL) and to explore its prognostic significance. Clinical data of 249 primary pediatric ALL patients diagnosed and treated in the Department of Hematological Oncology of Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 2018 to December 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to obtain gene mutation data and analyze the correlation between it and the prognosis of children with ALL. 227 (91.2%) were B-ALL, 22 (8.8%) were T-ALL among the 249 cases, and 178 (71.5%) were found to have gene mutations, of which 85 (34.1%) had ≥3 gene mutations. NRAS(23.7%), KRAS (22.9%),FLT3(11.2%), PTPN11(8.8%), CREBBP (7.2%), Genetic mutations are prevalent in childhood ALL and mutations in 儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病患者基因突变谱与预后相关性的临床研究. 分析儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）患者的基因突变谱，并探讨其对患儿预后的影响. 回顾性分析2018年1月至2021年12月于武汉儿童医院血液肿瘤科249例初诊ALL患儿的临床资料，采用靶向特异性二代测序（Next-generation sequencing, NGS）技术获得基因突变谱数据，并分析其与ALL患儿预后的相关性. 249例患儿中B-ALL 227例（91.2%），T-ALL 22例（8.8%）；178例（71.5%）患儿检测发现基因突变，其中85例（34.1%）患儿存在≥3种基因突变。突变率较高的基因依次为NRAS（23.7%）、KRAS（22.9%）、FLT3（11.2%）、PTPN11（8.8%）、CREBBP（7.2%）、 儿童ALL普遍存在基因突变，",0
"To test the feasibility of dry milling oats (Avena sativa L.) to concentrate antioxidant activity and phenolic antioxidants, groats were pearled for 5 to 180 s. These treatments removed <1 to 15% of the weight. The material obtained from short pearling times was mostly bran. Longer pearling times increased the amount of starchy endosperm in the pearlings. Antioxidant activity of 80% ethanol extracts, measured by β-carotene bleaching and by reduction of the free radical, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, was highest in the short-pearling-time fractions and decreased as more endosperm tissue was included. Likewise, there was a decreasing concentration of total phenolics, determined colorimetrically, and of several simple phenolic acids, determined by high performance liquid chromatography, as more material was pearled from the groats. In contrast, concentrations of avenanthramides were not correlated with pearling time, indicating that they were more uniformly distributed in the groats.",1
"A simple and sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the citrus flavanone hesperidin and other flavonoid 7-rutinosides is described. The assay utilizes antibodies raised against a hesperidin 4-O-carboxymethyl-oxime hapten and a tritiated radiotracer prepared by direct reduction of hesperidin with NaB[3-H]4. The detection limit of the assay is 0.2 ng/0.1 ml (0.3 pmol/0.1 ml and the measuring range extends to 10 ng/0.1 ml (16.4 pmol/0.1 ml). This assay is specific for flavonoid rutinosides, is characterized by a low coefficient of variation, and shows good correlation with HPLC for the quantification of hesperidin in oranges. The application of this method in determining the distribution of hesperidin in leaves, fruit, seeds, and seedlings of Citrus sinensis is also reported.",1
"We studied the effects of harvesting and two processing systems (two-phase centrifugation and three-phase centrifugation) on olive oil quality. Oils extracted from high quality olives do not differ in free acidity, peroxide value and ultraviolet light absorption. Nor was the fatty acid composition affected. However, the antioxidant content of the oil was higher from green olives than from ripe olives. On the other hand, we determined that neither extraction method affects the presence of α-tocopherol and β-carotene, however, the phenolic content is higher in the two-phase method due to the addition of lukewarm water that is used to dilute the olive paste.",1
"The colour of red onions is due primarily to anthocyanins present in the epidermal cells of the scale leaves of the bulb. The occurrence of the four major anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-laminaribioside, cyanidin 3-malonylglucoside and cyanidin 3-malonyllaminaribioside, was confirmed in four red onion cultivars, namely ‘Mambo’, ‘Red Jumbo’, ‘Red Bone’, and ‘Red Granex’. In addition, four new minor anthocyanin pigments were isolated and characterized from red onions. Two structures were determined by chemical and spectroscopic methods to be peonidin 3-glucoside, and peonidin 3-malonylglucoside. This is the first report of the occurrence of simple and malonylated peonidin glucosides in red onions.",1

"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents, with some patients exhibiting bone marrow involvement. Leukemic presentations of RMS have been documented in the literature. However, distinguishing RMS with bone marrow metastasis from acute leukemia can be challenging due to their overlapping morphological features, particularly in the absence of a characteristic primary mass. In this report, we present a case of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) that was initially misdiagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). After reviewing similar case reports, we propose that the presence of scattered cytoplasmic vacuoles in the blast-like cells of the bone marrow, significant differences in the percentage of blast-like cells between the bone marrow and peripheral blood, and the presence of tumor masses in locations typically associated with RMS may serve as indicators for differentiating RMS that mimics acute leukemia.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common paediatric malignancy. While extramedullary manifestations can occur, renal infiltration is rare. We report the case of a previously healthy one-year-old girl who presented with a two-week history of intermittent fever, lethargy, and progressive abdominal distension. On examination, she was lethargic, with bilateral palpable abdominal masses. Laboratory investigations revealed leukocytosis, bicytopenia, and abnormal urinalysis. A peripheral blood film and flow cytometry confirmed B-cell ALL. Ultrasonography demonstrated bilateral renal enlargement, suggestive of leukemic infiltration. Despite massive nephromegaly, she maintained normal renal function, fluid balance, blood pressure, and urine output. Her nephromegaly resolved clinically within four weeks of initiation of multi-agent chemotherapy. Renal involvement in ALL is an uncommon extramedullary manifestation, often asymptomatic and incidentally discovered on imaging. The majority of reported cases show that leukemic infiltration of the kidneys typically does not impair renal function. Nephromegaly in ALL has no established prognostic significance, with most cases resolving following chemotherapy initiation. This case highlights the importance of considering ALL in the differential diagnosis of paediatric patients presenting with unexplained nephromegaly and/or abdominal masses. Although renal dysfunction in this context is rare, close monitoring and careful management to prevent tumor lysis syndrome are of paramount importance to optimise outcomes.",0
"Wine contains a large number of polyphenols including stilbenes, flavanols and anthocyanins. Of these, stilbenes have been reported to have potential chemopreventive activities. We describe the simultaneous determination of six resveratrol derivatives in wines by liquid chromatography (LC) with fluorescence detection. The levels of pallidol, the symmetrical dimer of resveratrol, are reported for the first time. Quantifications were carried out at optimal wavelengths for each compound during separation. A total of 19 red and 30 white commercial wines from South-Western France were analysed, and the highest stilbene concentrations were found in red wines. In addition, the levels of catechins and two flavanonols recently isolated in red wine are reported.",1
