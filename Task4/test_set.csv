"Quantification of lignans in food using isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease prevention.",1
"A simple method for the characterization and quantification of soy isoflavone metabolites in the serum of MMTV-Neu mice using high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectr In a study aimed at elucidation of the possible role of dietary phytoestrogens in the growth of breast cancer, it was necessary to develop a convenient, accurate, and reproducible method for the characterization and quantification of isoflavone metabolites in the serum of MMTV mice that were fed diets containing different amounts of these polyphenols. The analytical method is based on liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode, using deuterated genistein as internal standard. The identified metabolites were genistein and dihydrodaidzein (DHD); their average concentrations in serum were 0.71 and 0.21 microM, respectively, for animals fed 1.5 mg/day of genistein and 0.7 mg/day of daidzein. This method assured a limit of quantification of 0.04 microM for genistein and 0.08 microM for DHD, and a limit of detection of 0.018 microM for genistein and 0.035 microM for DHD. The coefficient of variation was 8.9% for genistein and lower than 15% for DHD. This study provides the first data indicating the presence of dihydrodaidzein in serum of mice fed diets containing soy proteins.",1
"Analysis of phenolic constituents of biological interest in red wines by high-performance liquid chromatography We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and diode array detection to determine four biologically active phenolic constituents of red wines: gallic acid, trans-resveratrol, quercetin and rutin. The method permits direct injection without sample pre-treatment. ODS Hypersil served as the stationary phase; the gradient was formed by acetic acid, methanol, and water. Each analysis required an equilibration period of 10 min and a run time of 50 min for completion. Previously, total phenols were analysed according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, using gallic acid as the standard, and the results are given as gallic acid equivalent.",0
"Antioxidant activities and anthocyanin content of fresh fruits of common fig (Ficus carica L.) Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside (cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively. C3R contributed 92% of the total antioxidant capacity of the anthocyanin fraction. Fruits of the Mission variety contained the highest levels of polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins and exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity.",1
"Effect of soaking, boiling, and steaming on total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of cool season food legumes The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant components and activities.",1
"Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry identification of proanthocyanidins in rat plasma after oral administration of grape seed extract Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective effects of GSE.",0
"Characterization of flavonol conjugates in immature leaves of pak choi (Brassica rapa L. ssp. chinensis L. (Hanelt.)) by HPLC-DAD and LC-MS/MS The flavonoid composition of immature leaves of pak choi [Brassica rapa L. ssp. chinensis L. (Hanelt.)] was investigated. Flavonol aglycone content was measured in 11 pak choi varieties, indicating significant differences (P < 0.05) in content between varieties and relatively high contents of kaempferol and isorhamnetin. Levels of quercetin ranged from 3.2 to 6.1 mg/100 g of dry weight (DW), whereas levels of isorhamnetin and kaempferol were significantly higher (8.1-35.1 and 36.0-102.6 mg/100 g of DW, respectively). A large number of glycoside and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin were identified in cv. 'Shanghai' by LC/UV-DAD/ESI-MS/MS. The UV-DAD data allowed identification of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but detailed MS/MS fragmentations were required for the structure elucidation. Pak choi could be a potentially important source of dietary flavonols, in particular, kaempferol and isorhamnetin.",1

"Quantification of free and protein-bound trans-resveratrol metabolites and identification of trans-resveratrol-C/O-conjugated diglucuronides - two novel resveratrol metabolites in human plasma The polyphenol trans-resveratrol (t-RES) is present as t-RES-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, termed piceid, in several plant-derived foods. Although data on the metabolism and on in vivo effects of t-RES have been reported, quantitative data on the metabolites formed after dietary intake of t-RES or piceid are still lacking. In this study, 85.5 mg of piceid per 70 kg of body weight (bw) were administered to healthy volunteers in a bolus dose. t-RES metabolites formed in plasma and urine were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS, NMR, and HPLC-DAD analysis using chemically synthesized t-RES conjugate standards. In addition, the amount of t-RES metabolites bound noncovalently to plasma proteins was determined for the first time in humans. The metabolites identified and quantified were t-RES-3-sulfate, t-RES-3,4'-disulfate, t-RES-3,5-disulfate, t-RES-3-glucuronide and t-RES-4'-glucuronide, with t-RES-sulfates being the dominant conjugates in plasma and urine. Besides these metabolites, two novel t-RES-C/O-conjugated diglucuronides have been identified and quantified in plasma and urine. Moreover, it could be shown that up to 50% of the plasma t-RES-3-sulfate, t-RES-disulfates, and the novel t-RES-C/O-diglucuronides were bound to proteins. Total recovery of the dietary administered piceid in urine ranged between 13.6 and 35.7%.",1
"Repeated oral administration of high doses of the pomegranate ellagitannin punicalagin to rats for 37 days is not toxic The water-soluble ellagitanin punicalagin has been reported to be toxic to cattle. Taking into account that this antioxidant polyphenol is very abundant in pomegranate juice (> or =2 g/L), the present study evaluated the possible toxic effect of punicalagin in Sprague-Dawley rats upon repeated oral administration of a 6% punicalagin-containing diet for 37 days. Punicalagin and related metabolites were identified by HPLC-DAD-MS-MS in plasma, liver, and kidney. Five punicalagin-related metabolites were detected in liver and kidney, that is, two ellagic acid derivatives, gallagic acid, 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one glucuronide, and 3,8,10-trihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one. Feedstuff intake, food utility index, and growth rate were lower in treated rats during the first 15 days without significant adverse effects, which could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet together with a decrease in its palatability (lower food intake). No significant differences were found in treated rats in any blood parameter analyzed (including the antioxidant enzymes gluthatione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) with the exception of urea and triglycerides, which remained at low values throughout the experiment. Although the reason for the decrease is unclear, it could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet with respect to the standard rat food. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney corroborated the absence of toxicity. In principle, the results reported here, together with the large safety margin considered, indicate the lack of toxic effect of punicalagin in rats during the 37 day period investigated. However, taking into account the high punicalagin content of pomegranate-derived foodstuffs, safety evaluation should be also carried out in humans with a lower dose and during a longer period of intake.",0
"Anthocyanin absorption, metabolism, and distribution from a wild blueberry-enriched diet (Vaccinium angustifolium) is affected by diet duration in the Sprague-Dawley rat The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) (WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the present experimental conditions.",0
"Metabolism of antioxidant and chemopreventive ellagitannins from strawberries, raspberries, walnuts, and oak-aged wine in humans: Identification of biomarkers and individual variability Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.",0
"Effects of different cooking methods on antioxidant profile, antioxidant capacity, and physical characteristics of artichoke In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.",0
"Changes in phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of virgin olive oil during frying The concentration of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA) and its secoiridoid derivatives (3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA) in virgin olive oil decreased rapidly when the oil was repeatedly used for preparing french fries in deep-fat frying operations. At the end of the first frying process (10 min at 180 degrees C), the concentration of the dihydroxyphenol components was reduced to 50-60% of the original value, and after six frying operations only about 10% of the initial components remained. However, tyrosol (p-HPEA) and its derivatives (p-HPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EA) in the oil were much more stable during 12 frying operations. The reduction in their original concentration was much smaller than that for hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives and showed a roughly linear relationship with the number of frying operations. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract measured using the DPPH test rapidly diminished during the first six frying processes, from a total antioxidant activity higher than 740 micromol of Trolox/kg down to less than 250 micromol/kg. On the other hand, the concentration of polar compounds, oxidized triacylglycerol monomers (oxTGs), dimeric TGs, and polymerized TGs rapidly increased from the sixth frying operation onward, when the antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract was very low, and as a consequence the oil was much more susceptible to oxidation. The loss of antioxidant activity in the phenolic fraction due to deep-fat frying was confirmed by the storage oil and oil-in-water emulsions containing added extracts from olive oil used for 12 frying operations.",0
"Polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of vegetables under fresh and frozen conditions The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice (WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid (PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.",1

"Profile of plasma and urine metabolites after the intake of almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb] polyphenols in humans Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of (epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.",1
"Stoichiometric and kinetic studies of phenolic antioxidants from Andean purple corn and red-fleshed sweetpotato Stoichiometric and kinetic values of phenolics against DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were determined for Andean purple corn (Zea mays L.) and red sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas). Both crops had higher antioxidant capacity and antiradical kinetics than blueberries and higher or similar anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) was 1.56, 1.12, 0.57, and 0.26 (mg antiradical/mL)(-1) s(-1) for red sweetpotato, Trolox, purple corn, and blueberry, respectively. On the molar basis of active hydroxyl groups, k(2)' showed the same order as for k(2). Corn cob and sweetpotato endodermis contributed the most in phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity. Both crops studied can be considered as excellent novel sources of natural antioxidants for the functional food and dietary supplement markets.",1
"A urinary profile study of dietary phytoestrogens. The identification and mode of metabolism of new isoflavonoids The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with soya.",0
"Plant foods and herbal sources of resveratrol Stilbenes, in particular trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, are widely reported to be beneficial to health, having been shown to possess antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and antitumor properties. Major dietary sources include grapes, wine, peanuts, and soy; however, they can also be introduced into the diet through Itadori tea, which has long been used in Japan and China as a traditional herbal remedy for heart disease and strokes. Analysis of grapes, peanuts, and Itadori tea shows that they contain mainly trans-resveratrol glucoside. In contrast, red wines are primarily a source of the aglycones cis- and trans-resveratrol. While peanuts and grapes contain low levels of the stilbenes, Itadori tea and red wine both supply relatively high concentrations of resveratrol. For people who do not consume alcohol, Itadori tea may be a suitable substitute for red wine. However, further study on the potential biological effects of other endogenous compounds in Itadori tea is required and there is also a need for more information on the absorption and in vivo biomedical actions of free and conjugated resveratrol.",1

"Urinary flavonoids and phenolic acids as biomarkers of intake for polyphenol-rich foods Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between the intake of polyphenol-rich foods and the urinary excretion of several phenolic compounds and therefore explore whether these phenolic compounds could be used as a biomarker of intake. Fifty-three participants of the SU.VI.MAX study (a randomised primary-prevention trial evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) collected a 24 h urine and a spot urine sample and filled a dietary record during a 2 d period. Thirteen polyphenols and metabolites, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid, gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin, phloretin, enterolactone and enterodiol, were measured using HPLC-electrospray ionisation-MS-MS. In spot samples apple consumption was positively correlated to phloretin, grapefruit consumption to naringenin, orange to hesperetin, citrus fruit consumption to both naringenin and hesperetin, with r coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.57 (P < 0.05). The combination of fruits and/or fruit juices was positively correlated to gallic acid and 4-O-methylgallic acid, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin and phloretin (r 0.24-0.44, P < 0.05). Coffee consumption was positively correlated to caffeic and chlorogenic acids (r 0.29 and 0.63, P < 0.05 respectively). Black tea and wine consumption were positively correlated with gallic and 4-O-methylgallic acids (r 0.37-0.54, P < 0.001). The present results suggest that several polyphenols measured in a spot urine sample can be used as biomarkers of polyphenol-rich food intake.",1
"Determination of flavonoids in plant material by HPLC with diode-array and electro-array detections A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with in-line connected diode-array (DAD) and electro-array (EC) detection to identify and quantify 17 flavonoids in plant-derived foods is described. Catechins were extracted from the samples using ethyl acetate, and quantification of these compounds was performed with the EC detector. Other flavonoids were quantified with DAD after acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the determination of catechins and other flavonoids in plant-derived foods. Responses of the detection systems were linear within the range evaluated, 20-200 ng/injection (DAD) and 20-100 ng/injection (EC), with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.999. Coefficient of variation was under 10.5%, and recoveries of flavonoids ranged from 70 to 124%. Purity of the flavonoid peaks was confirmed by combining the spectral and voltammetric data.",1

"Analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography diode-array detection, time-of-flight mass spectrometry and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.",1

"Absorption and metabolism of red orange juice anthocyanins in rats Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.",1

"Varietal differences among the polyphenol profiles of seven table grape cultivars studied by LC-DAD-MS-MS Polyphenols present in red table grape varieties Red Globe, Flame Seedless, Crimson Seedless, and Napoleon, and the white varieties Superior Seedless, Dominga, and Moscatel Italica were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS. The anthocyanins peonidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside (and their corresponding p-coumaroyl derivatives), malvidin 3-glucoside, petunidin 3-glucoside, and delphinidin 3-glucoside were found. In addition, caffeoyltartaric acid, p-coumaroyltartaric acid, and the flavonols quercetin 3-glucuronide, quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-galactoside, kaempferol 3-glucoside, and isorhamnetin 3-glucoside were detected. Flavan-3-ols were also detected, and were identified as gallocatechin, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, procyanidin B4, procyanidin C1, catechin, and epigallocatechin. These phenolics were present only in the skin, as the flesh of these grape cultivars was almost devoid of these compounds. Anthocyanins were the main phenolics in red grapes ranging from 69 (Crimson Seedless) to 151 (Flame Seedless) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes, whereas flavan-3-ols were the most abundant phenolics in the white varieties ranging from 52 (Dominga) to 81 (Moscatel Italica) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes. Total phenolics ranged from 115 (Dominga) to 361 (Flame Seedless) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes. This means that a serving of unpeeled table grapes (200 g) could provide up to 72 mg of total phenolics (Flame Seedless). These results indicate that the intake of unpeeled table grapes should be recommended in dietary habits as a potential source of antioxidant and anticarcinogenic phenolic compounds.",0
"Quantification of flavonoid constituents in Citrus fruits Twenty-four flavonoids have been determined in 66 Citrus species and near-citrus relatives, grown in the same field and year, by means of reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Statistical methods have been applied to find relations among the species. The F ratios of 21 flavonoids obtained by applying ANOVA analysis are significant, indicating that a classification of the species using these variables is reasonable to pursue. Principal component analysis revealed that the distributions of Citrus species belonging to different classes were largely in accordance with Tanaka's classification system.",0
"Absorption, metabolism, and excretion of cider dihydrochalcones in healthy humans and subjects with an ileostomy The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 38.6% of intake.",1
"Structural characterization of the metabolites of hydroxytyrosol, the principal phenolic component in olive oil, in rats Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost devoid of radical scavenging activity.",1

"Composition and properties of flaxseed phenolic oligomers An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG was the only active antioxidant.",1

"Identification of puerarin and its metabolites in rats by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.",0
"Resveratrol and piceid levels in natural and blended peanut butters Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.",1
"Simultaneous determination of multiple constituents in real beer samples of different origins by capillary zone electrophoresis Simultaneous determination of alcohols, amines, amino acids, flavonoids, and purine and pyrimidine bases in bottled beer samples directly without any pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and quantitative and has been applied to seven types of international bottled beers of different origins bought locally.",1

"Aspalathin, a flavonoid in Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), is absorbed by pig intestine as a C-glycoside Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos extracts.",0
"Antioxidants in thermally treated buckwheat groats The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity (SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of the antioxidant capacity.",1
"Phenolic compounds in external leaves of Tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC) Glycosylated kaempferol derivatives from the external leaves of tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC) characterized by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD-MS/MS-ESI were kaempferol 3-O-sophorotrioside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O- (methoxycaffeoyl/caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophorotrioside-7-O-sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-tetraglucoside-7-O-sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl/caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl/caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophorotrioside, kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl)sophorotrioside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, and kaempferol 3-O-glucoside. These acylated derivatives are reported for the first time in nature, with the exception of kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside. Quantification of the identified compounds was achieved by HPLC-DAD and carried out in samples cultivated under conventional or organic practices and collected at different times. In general, samples from organic production exhibited higher total phenolics content than those from conventional practices collected in the same period.",1
"Influence of organic versus conventional agricultural practice on the antioxidant microconstituent content of tomatoes and derived purees  consequences on antioxidant plasma status in humans The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.",0

"HPLC method for the quantification of procyanidins in cocoa and chocolate samples and correlation to total antioxidant capacity Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay as an indicator for potential biological activity.",0
"Isotope Dilution Gas Chromatographic-Mass Spectrometric Method for the Determination of Isoflavonoids, Coumestrol, and Lignans in Food Samples We present a method for the quantitative determination of the phytoestrogens formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol and simultaneously the lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and matairesinol in plant-derived foods. These compounds are measured by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode (ID/GC/MS/SIM) using synthesized deuterated internal standards for the correction of losses during the procedure. A three-step hydrolysis--a rehydration with distilled H2O, followed by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis--has been applied in order to convert the diphenolic glycosides into their respective aglycones. Purification and separation are carried out in two ion-exchange chromatographic steps followed by derivatization and GC-MS. The within-assay imprecision values vary 3.1-9.6% and the between-assay imprecision 7.0-21.2%. The mean recovery of authentic standards processed through the whole procedure varied from 95.5 to 105.5%. Values for some different food samples are presented. The simultaneous determination of the biologically most interesting phytoestrogens and lignans in foods has not been carried out previously and the method will be useful for screening of important foods in populations with different risk of cancer and coronary heart disease, and for metabolic studies.",1

"Urinary excretion of lignans after administration of isolated plant lignans to rats: the effect of single dose and ten-day exposures The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.",0

"Importance of insoluble-bound phenolics to antioxidant properties of wheat Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or +/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 +/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is essential.",1
"Changes in phytochemical and antioxidant activity of selected pepper cultivars (Capsicum species) as influenced by maturity The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.",0
"Flavonoid (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin) content of edible tropical plants Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots (1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves (30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg).

"Processing and storage effects on monomeric anthocyanins, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity of processed blackberry products Blackberries are a rich source of polyphenolics, particularly anthocyanins, that may contribute to the reduced risk of chronic disease; however, as with most berries, the fresh fruit are only seasonally available. With most of the blackberries consumed as frozen or in thermally processed forms after long-term storage, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing and 6 months of storage on the anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity of blackberries that were individually quick-frozen (IQF), canned-in-syrup, canned-in-water, pureed, and juiced (clarified and nonclarified). Monomeric anthocyanins, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC FL) and photochemiluminescence (PCL) were determined postprocessing (1 day) and after 1, 3, and 6 months of storage. Processing resulted in increases in polymeric color values (up to 7%) and losses in monomeric anthocyanins (up to 65%). For most products, processing also resulted in losses in antioxidant capacity (by ORAC FL and PCL). Storage at 25 degrees C of all processed products resulted in dramatic losses in monomeric anthocyanins with as much as 75% losses of anthocyanins throughout storage, which coincided with marked increases of percent polymeric color values of these products over 6 months of storage. There were no changes in ORAC FL or PCL for processed products throughout long-term storage. No significant changes in antioxidant capacity or anthocyanin content were observed in IQF fruit during long-term storage at -20 degrees C.",1
"Epicatechin, procyanidins, and phenolic microbial metabolites after cocoa intake in humans and rats Proanthocyanidins, flavonoids exhibiting cardiovascular protection, constitute a major fraction of the flavonoid ingested in the human diet. Although they are poorly absorbed, they are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into various phenolic acids. An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive measurement of a large number of metabolites in a very short run time, which makes it ideal for use in epidemiological studies.",0
"Tissue distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rat Sesame exhibits many beneficial physiological effects, which are mostly related to its lignan compounds, such as sesaminol glucosides. This investigation studies the distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside from sesame in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In order to investigate the distribution of sesaminol triglucoside (p.o. 500 mg/kg) in SD rats, the changes in concentration of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites were determined in tissues and plasma within 24 h period after tube-feeding to SD rats. Results showed that sesaminol triglucoside may be deglycosylated to form sesaminol first by intestinal microflora and then incorporated via lymphatic absorption into the cardiovascular system, transported to other tissues. The concentrations of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rectum, caecum, colon, and small intestines are higher than those in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. Its concentration in brain is low but detectable. Glucuronidation and sulfation was the main metabolic pathway for sesaminol in urine, and fecal elimination was a major route of elimination. From LC/MS/MS analysis of rat organs, sesaminol triglucoside can be converted to mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END), and enterolactone (ENL), by rat intestinal microflora. In the plasma, concentrations of END and ENL were 5.9 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 micromol/mL, respectively.",0

"Phenolic acids in berries, fruits, and beverages The contents of soluble and total phenolic acids were analyzed in samples of 29 berries and berry products, 24 fruits and fruit peels, and 12 beverages. Variation of phenolic acids in berries was also studied. Soluble phenolic acids were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, and a tentative quantification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total phenolic acid content was determined by HPLC after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The content of total phenolic acids as aglycones in the above samples varied from 0 (pear cider) to 103 mg/100 g fresh weight (rowanberry). Besides rowanberry, the best phenolic acid sources among berries were chokeberry (96 mg/100 g), blueberry (85 mg/100 g), sweet rowanberry (75 mg/100 g), and saskatoon berry (59 mg/100 g). Among fruits, the highest contents (28 mg/100 g) were determined in dark plum, cherry, and one apple variety (Valkea Kuulas). Coffee (97 mg/100 g) as well as green and black teas (30-36 mg/100 g) were the best sources among beverages. Caffeic acid dominated in all of these samples except in tea brews. Variation in the phenolic acid contents of the berries was either small or moderate.",1
"Anthocyanin metabolism in rats and their distribution to digestive area, kidney, and brain Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.",0
"Oxidative metabolism of the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein in humans in vitro and in vivo The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are found in high concentrations in human plasma and urine after soy consumption. However, in vitro and in vivo data regarding the oxidative metabolism of isoflavones in humans are scarce. Therefore, we have studied the oxidative metabolites of these compounds formed in human liver microsomes and excreted in urine of male and female humans ingesting soy products for 2 days. Human liver microsomes transformed the soy isoflavone daidzein to three monohydroxylated and three dihydroxylated metabolites according to GC/MS analysis. On the basis of a previous study with rat liver microsomes and with the help of reference substances, these metabolites were identified as 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, and 6,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. Significant amounts of the same metabolites except 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone were also found in urine of female and male volunteers after soy intake. Genistein was metabolized by human liver microsomes to six hydroxylation products. The main metabolites were the three aromatic monohydroxylated products 5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. The aliphatic monohydroxylated metabolite 2,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and two aromatic dihydroxylated metabolites, 5,7,8,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone and 5,6,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone, were formed in trace amounts. The same hydroxylated genistein metabolites except the aliphatic hydroxylated one could also be detected in human urine samples. Methylated forms of the catechol metabolites, which were generated by incubations with catechol-O-methyltransferase in vitro could be detected only in trace amounts in the urine samples. This implies that this reaction does not play a major role in the biotransformation of the hydroxylated daidzein and genistein metabolites in vivo. Most of these oxidative metabolites are described as human in vivo metabolites for the first time. Their biological significance remains to be established.",1
"The metabolism of dietary polyphenols and the relevance to circulating levels of conjugated metabolites Berry extracts rich in anthocyanins have been linked to protective effects including the modulation of age-related neurological dysfunction and the improvement of the resistance of red blood cells against oxidative stress in vitro. In this study the bioavailability, metabolism and elimination of polyphenols from blackcurrant juice, rich in anthocyanins, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamates, were investigated. The four major native anthocyanidin glycosides of blackcurrant juice, delphinidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, were detected and identified in low amounts by HPLC and LC-MS in plasma and urine post-ingestion. Elimination of the anthocyanins was fast (maximum excretion after 1 h) and plasma levels (0-128.6 nmol/l) and total urinary exretion (0.07-1.35 mg; 0.007-0.133% of the dose ingested) were low. Most significantly, of the hydroxycinnamates, conjugated and free ferulic, isoferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic and vanillic acids were identified in plasma and urine, using GC-MS techniques. Quercetin and kaempferol (as glucuronides) and the proposed colonic metabolite of quercetin, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, were detectable in a minority of subjects. Increased daily urinary hippuric, 4-hydroxyhippuric and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid levels were also observed post-ingestion in all volunteers.",1
"Catechin Contents of Foods Commonly Consumed in The Netherlands. 1. Fruits, Vegetables, Staple Foods, and Processed Foods Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially beneficial to human health. To enable epidemiological evaluation of these compounds, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 24 types of fruits, 27 types of vegetables and legumes, some staple foods, and processed foods commonly consumed in The Netherlands. Most fruits, chocolate, and some legumes contained catechins. Levels varied to a large extent: from 4.5 mg/kg in kiwi fruit to 610 mg/kg in black chocolate. (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin were the predominant catechins; GC, EGC, and ECg were detected in some foods, but none of the foods contained EGCg. The data reported here provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic diseases.",0
"Strawberry anthocyanins are recovered in urine as glucuro- and sulfoconjugates in humans Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment. This study demonstrated that anthocyanins were glucuro- and sulfo-conjugated in humans and that the main metabolite of strawberry anthocyanins in human urine was a monoglucuronide of pelargonidin.",1

"Quantitative determination of isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol in rat plasma by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and its application to the pharmacokin A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the quantification of quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in rat plasma. After being treated with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase, the analytes were extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with the internal standard (IS; baicalein). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Diamonsil C(18) column with a mobile phase consisting of 2% formic acid/methanol (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min, with a split of 200 microL to the mass spectrometer. Validation results indicated that the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1 ng . mL(-1). The assay exhibited a linear range of 1-200 ng . mL(-1) and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9980 or better for each analyte. Quality control samples (1, 5, 20 and 100 ng . mL(-1)) in six replicates from each of three different runs demonstrated an intra-assay precision (RSD) of 1.1-8.9%, an inter-assay precision of 1.6-10.8%, and an overall accuracy (bias) of <13.4%. The extraction recovery of each analyte and internal standard was 70-80%. In the present study, we have investigated the pharmacokinetic profiles of isorhamnetin after oral application in rats equipped with a jugular catheter. After oral dosing of isorhamnetin, the mean values (n = 10) of C(max) were 57.8, 64.8 and 75.2 ng . mL(-1) which were achieved at a T(max) of 8.0, 6.4 and 7.2 h for oral doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg . kg(-1) body weight, respectively. The corresponding mean values for isorhamnetin area under the curver (AUC) from 0 to 60 h were 838.2, 1262.8, 1623.4 ng . h . mL(-1). Our results further demonstrated that the samples analyzed showed isorhamnetin could not be transformed into quercetin or kaempferol in rats, indicating that the demethylation of the 3'-oxymethyl group of isorhamnetin does not occur in Wistar rats.",1
"Comparative content of total polyphenols and dietary fiber in tropical fruits and persimmon Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and polyphenols of vegetables and fruits improve lipid metabolism and prevent the oxidation of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which hinder the development of atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber. It can be supposed that among the studied fruit, lichi, guava, and ripe mango may be preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis.",1
"Pomegranate juice ellagitannin metabolites are present in human plasma and some persist in urine for up to 48 hours Ellagitannins (ETs) from pomegranate juice (PJ) are reported to have numerous biological properties, but their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly understood. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of pomegranate ETs, 18 healthy volunteers were given 180 mL of PJ concentrate, and blood samples were obtained for 6 h afterwards. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were obtained on the day before (-1), the day of (0), and the day after (+1) the study. Ellagic acid (EA) was detected in plasma of all subjects with a maximum concentration of 0.06 +/- 0.01 micromol/L, area under concentration time curve of 0.17 +/- 0.02 (micromol x h) x L(-1), time of maximum concentration of 0.98 +/- 0.06 h, and elimination half-life of 0.71 +/- 0.08 h. EA metabolites, including dimethylellagic acid glucuronide (DMEAG) and hydroxy-6H-benzopyran-6-one derivatives (urolithins), were also detected in plasma and urine in conjugated and free forms. DMEAG was found in the urine obtained from 15 of 18 subjects on d 0, but was not detected on d -1 or +1, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker of intake. Urolithin A-glucuronide was found in urine samples from 11 subjects on d 0 and in the urine from 16 subjects on d +1. Urolithin B-glucuronide was found in the urine of 3 subjects on d 0 and in the urine of 5 subjects on d +1. Urolithins, formed by intestinal bacteria, may contribute to the biological effects of PJ as they may persist in plasma and tissues and account for some of the health benefits noted after chronic PJ consumption. Whether genetic polymorphisms in EA-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., catechol-O-methyl transferase and glucuronosyl transferase) are related to variations in response to PJ remains to be established.",1

"Analysis of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in juice beverages using high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric array detection Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.",0

"Processing and Storage Effects on the Ellagitannin Composition of Processed Blackberry Products Changes in blackberry ellagitannin composition in response to juicing (clarified and nonclarified), pureeing, canning (in water or syrup), and freezing as well as changes in processed products during 6 months of storage were investigated. Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.",1
"Phenolic acid profiles in some small berries The composition of phenolic acids in several small berries grown in Northeastern Poland, namely, low-bush blueberries, black mulberries, European juneberries, black currants, fruits of blue-berried honeysuckle, and blackberries, was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The total content of phenolic acids, identified by GC-MS, ranged from 2845.8 +/- 141.0 (black mulberries) to 5418.2 +/- 228.0 (blue-berried honeysuckle). Twenty phenolic acids were identified in the berries. Of these, hydroxycaffeic, m- and p-coumaric, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acids were the major phenolic acids in blackberries and blueberries, m-coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid in blue-berried honeysuckle and black currant fruits, while salicylic, caffeic, and m- and p-coumaric acids were the predominant phenolic acids in European juneberries. Syringic and veratric acids were detected only in blueberries, while p-hydroxybenzoic and sinapic acids were present only in black currants and o-coumaric acid was present in blueberries and black mulberries. The phenolic acids liberated from esters and glycosidic bonds were the major fractions of phenolic acids in the berries.",0
"Alkylresorcinols as markers of whole grain wheat and rye in cereal products The alkylresorcinol (AR) content of Swedish wheat grain samples, as well as of cereal ingredients and cereal foods containing wheat and rye, was determined. The average total AR content in Swedish wheat was 412 microg/g (ranging between 227 and 639 microg/g), which is lower than that in Swedish rye analyzed in a previous study. The relative composition of AR homologues was consistent for wheat samples and differed markedly from that of rye. Notably, the ratio of the homologues C17:0/C21:0 was approximately 0.1 in wheat and approximately 1.0 in rye, indicating that it can be used to distinguish between those two cereals. The AR content in cereal foods commonly consumed in Sweden varied widely, from nondetectable levels in white wheat flour and products not containing the outer parts of wheat and/or rye to >900 microg/g in some whole grain rye products. AR content in cereal foods was calculated from their recipes using average AR values for the cereal ingredients determined in this study. As there was a good correlation between calculated and analyzed AR levels in cereal foods (R2 = 0.91), it is possible to estimate the proportion of whole grain wheat and/or rye in a given cereal product on the basis of AR content and C17:0/C21:0 ratio. ARs appear to be good markers of whole grain wheat and rye in foods, and their analysis may be an objective way to identify foods rich in whole grain wheat and/or rye or brans thereof.",1

"Identification and quantification of phenolic compounds in berries of Fragaria and Rubus species (family Rosaceae) High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by acid hydrolysis of the extracts.",1
"Three-year comparison of the content of antioxidant microconstituents and several quality characteristics in organic and conventionally managed tomatoes and bell peppers Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol (17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol (20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.",0

"Phenolic and volatile compounds of extra virgin olive oil (Olea europaea L. cv. Cornicabra) with regard to fruit ripening and irrigation management This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August (RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied to the olive orchard.",0
"Determination of free phenolic acids in wort and beer by coulometric array detection The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.",0
"Molecular definition of the taste of roasted cocoa nibs (Theobroma cacao) by means of quantitative studies and sensory experiments Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.",0
"Polyphenol content and total antioxidant activity of vini novelli (young red wines) Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 +/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.",1
"Human metabolism of dietary flavonoids: identification of plasma metabolites of quercetin The position of conjugation of the flavonoid quercetin dramatically affects biological activity in vitro, therefore it is important to determine the exact nature of the plasma metabolites. In the present study, we have used various methods (HPLC with diode array detection, LCMS, chemical and enzymic synthesis of authentic conjugates and specific enzymic hydrolysis) to show that quercetin glucosides are not present in plasma of human subjects 1.5 h after consumption of onions (a rich source of flavonoid glucosides). All four individuals had similar qualitative profiles of metabolites. The major circulating compounds in the plasma after 1.5 h are identified as quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin-3'-sulfate. The existence of substitutions in the B and/or C ring of plasma quercetin metabolites suggests that these conjugates will each have very different biological activities.",1

"Microbial aromatic acid metabolites formed in the gut account for a major fraction of the polyphenols excreted in urine of rats fed red wine polyphenols The health effects of dietary polyphenols might be explained by both intact compounds and their metabolites formed either in the tissues or in the colon by the microflora. The quantitative importance and biological activities of the microbial metabolites have seldom been examined in vivo. We measured the microbial metabolites formed in four groups of rats (n = 8) fed for 8 d a diet supplemented with 0.12 g/100 g catechin, 0.25 or 0.50 g/100 g red wine powder containing proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids, flavanols, anthocyanins and flavonols or an unsupplemented diet. Fourteen aromatic acid metabolites were assayed in urine collected for 24 h by an HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS)-MS method. The three main metabolites formed from the catechin diet were 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid. Their total urinary excretion accounted for 4.7 g/100 g of the catechin ingested and that of intact catechins for 45.3 g/100 g. For wine polyphenols, the same microbial metabolites as observed for the catechin diet were identified in urine along with hippuric, p-coumaric, vanillic, 4-hydroxybenzoic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids. All together, these aromatic acids accounted for 9.2 g/100 g of the total wine polyphenols ingested and intact catechins for only 1.2 g/100 g. The higher excretion of aromatic acids by rats fed wine polyphenols is likely due to their poor absorption in the proximal part of the gut. Some of the microbial metabolites still bear a reducing phenolic group and should also prevent oxidative stress in inner tissues. More attention should be given in the future to these microbial metabolites and their biological properties to help explain the health effects of polyphenols that are not easily absorbed through the gut barrier.",1
"RP-HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using a CoulArray detector Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved identification of natural antioxidants.",0

"Variability of the polyphenolic composition of cider apple (Malus domestica) fruits and juices Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close to 80 and 30%, respectively.",1
"Identification, quantitative determination, and antioxidative activities of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune (Prunus domestica L.) Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed antioxidative activities which were almost the same.",1
"Determination of flavonol metabolites in plasma and tissues of rats by HPLC-radiocounting and tandem mass spectrometry following oral ingestion of [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of flavonol-rich diets decreases the risk of developing heart disease and certain cancers. Recent studies have detected flavonol conjugates in blood and urine following various dietary interventions. To assess to what extent flavonols also accumulate in tissues, where they might be expected to exert anti-carcinogenic and anti-atherogenic effects, [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was synthesized and fed to rats. After 60 min, 93.6% of the ingested radioactivity was recovered from the intestine, incorporated into 18 metabolites that had undergone deglycosylation followed by varying degrees of glucuronidation, methylation, and/or sulfation. [(14)C]Quercetin, the aglycon of the radiolabeled substrate, was present in the intestine and in trace amounts in the liver but was not detected in the plasma and kidneys. The original [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was detected exclusively in the intestine, where it accounted for only 26.2% of the radioactivity. The remainder of the recovered radioactivity was located mainly in the plasma, liver, and kidneys as (14)C-labeled metabolites. However, compared to the quantities in the gastrointestinal tract, the levels of metabolites in plasma and body tissues were very low, indicating only limited absorption into the blood stream. The data demonstrate that quercetin-4'-glucoside, which is a major flavonol in onions, undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism in the intestine, and this appears not to be associated to any extent with transport across the gut wall into the blood stream.",1

"Polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of seed coat and cotyledon from Brazilian and Peruvian bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was more related to the total phenolic content.",0
"Isoflavones in retail and institutional soy foods A national sampling plan was developed to select the most widely used isoflavone-containing foods in the United States. Foods were selected based on their retail volume and sampled in five geographical areas representing seven metropolitan areas. Isoflavones were analyzed from composite samples, raw and cooked, and reported by brand. Quality control measures were evaluated throughout the study. Isoflavone levels ranged from 1 microg/g in soy sauces to 540 microg/g in tempeh. Soymilk and tofu represented the major portion of soy foods evaluated. These data will appear in the electronic version of USDA Handbook No. 8 of Food Composition Data in 1999.",1

"Monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines and grapes from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet Sauvignon The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer subunit composition and mDP.",0
"Effect of the maturation process of the olive fruit on the phenolic fraction of drupes and oils from Arbequina, Fraga, and Morrut cultivars The purpose of the work was to investigate the effect of the maturation process of the olive fruit on the phenolic fraction of drupes and oils from Arbequina, Farga, and Morrut cultivars. The level in the phenolic content of olive drupes declines rapidly during the black maturation phase. A general decreasing trend was observed too in the phenolic content of olive oils during the ripening process in the three varieties studied. Important differences in the high-performance liquid chromatography profile between varieties were observed. These included the presence of very low amounts of lignans in olive oils proceeding from the Morrut cultivar, and the presence of three peaks after elution of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA in the Farga and Morrut cultivars, which could be used as differentiating parameters. Sensory profile differences were observed between olive cultivars and due to the ripening process.",1
"Alkylresorcinol content and homologue composition in durum wheat (Triticum dururm) kernels and pasta products The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 (0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).",1
"Development and validation of an LC-MS/MS analysis for simultaneous determination of delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-(6-malonylglucoside) in human plasma and urine after b Blood orange juice has a high content in anthocyanins, especially represented by delphinidin-3-glucoside (D3G), cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and cyanidin-3-(6-malonylglucoside) (CMG). An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of D3G and C3G in human plasma and urine was developed and validated. After sample preparation by SPE, chromatographic separation was performed with an RP-C(18) column, using a water/methanol linear gradient. The quantitation of target compounds was determined by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, using ESI. The method showed good selectivity, sensitivity (LOD = 0.05 and 0.10 ng/mL for C3G in plasma and urine, respectively; LOD = 0.10 ng/mL for D3G in plasma and urine), linearity (0.20-200 ng/mL; r >or= 0.998), intra- and interday precision and accuracy (<or= 14.6%) and satisfactory recoveries (80.0-110.4%) for the target compounds in both plasma and urine. Stability of analytes in plasma and urine has been investigated in detail. This method was successfully applied to the determination of D3G, C3G and CMG levels in human plasma and urine after the ingestion of a single dose (500 mL) of blood orange juice.",1
"Procyanidin and catechin contents and antioxidant capacity of cocoa and chocolate products Cocoa and chocolate products from major brands were analyzed blind for total antioxidant capacity (AOC) (lipophilic and hydrophilic ORAC(FL)), catechins, and procyanidins (monomer through polymers). Accuracy of analyses was ascertained by comparing analyses on a NIST standard reference chocolate with NIST certified values. Procyanidin (PC) content was related to the nonfat cocoa solid (NFCS) content. The natural cocoa powders (average 87% of NFCS) contained the highest levels of AOC (826 +/- 103 micromol of TE/g) and PCs (40.8 +/- 8.3 mg/g). Alkalized cocoa (Dutched powders, average 80% NFCS) contained lower AOC (402 +/- 6 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (8.9 +/- 2.7 mg/g). Unsweetened chocolates or chocolate liquor (50% NFCS) contained 496 +/- 40 micromol of TE /g of AOC and 22.3 +/- 2.9 mg/g of PCs. Milk chocolates, which contain the least amount of NFCS (7.1%), had the lowest concentrations of AOC (80 +/- 10 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (2.7 +/- 0.5 mg/g). One serving of cocoa (5 g) or chocolate (15 or 40 g, depending upon the type of chocolate) provides 2000-9100 micromol of TE of AOC and 45-517 mg of PCs, amounts that exceed the amount in a serving of the majority of foods consumed in America. The monomers through trimers, which are thought to be directly bioavailable, contributed 30% of the total PCs in chocolates. Hydrophilic antioxidant capacity contributed >90% of AOC in all products. The correlation coefficient between AOC and PCs in chocolates was 0.92, suggesting that PCs are the dominant antioxidants in cocoa and chocolates. These results indicate that NFCS is correlated with AOC and PC in cocoa and chocolate products. Alkalizing dramatically decreased both the procyanidin content and antioxidant capacity, although not to the same extent.",1
"Disposition and biotransformation of the estrogenic isoflavone daidzein in rats Daidzein is an estrogenic isoflavone present in many plants and therefore consumed in relatively high doses by humans. Daidzein has a low affinity for the estrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been demonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high doses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats fed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats were orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were collected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were quantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and daidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and daidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted for < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein elimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive daidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, O-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). Excretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with elimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and feces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The results suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as conjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the gastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak estrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other estrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.",1
"Alkylresorcinol content and homologue composition in durum wheat (Triticum dururm) kernels and pasta products The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the corresponding flour mixtures, were determined.

"Oxygen radical absorbing capacity of phenolics in blueberries, cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries The antioxidant activity of phenolics in fruits of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum cv. Sierra), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Ben Lear), wild chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea cv. Amberland) was determined in this study. The phenolic constituents and contents among the different berries varied considerably. Anthocyanins were found to be the main components in all these berries. Chlorogenic acid in blueberry, quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.",1
"Chemometric studies of vinegars from different raw materials and processes of production The phenolic composition, aroma compounds, and organic acid content of 83 vinegars have been determined. Multivariate analysis techniques have been used to classify these vinegar samples according to raw material (white wine, red wine, apple, honey, alcohol, balsamic, and malt) and production process (with and without aging in wood). Cluster analysis grouped the samples according to production process. Only apple and balsamic vinegars were separated from wine vinegars. Alcohol, honey, and malt vinegars were grouped with no aged wine vinegars. Linear discriminate analysis allowed a 88% differentiation according to raw material and 100% according to aging in wood. Besides, from the results obtained, a major role of the volatile compounds in the differentiation of the vinegar samples according to their aging period in wood can be seen.",0

"Variability in the Distribution of Phenolic Compounds in Milled Fractions of Chickpea and Horse Gram: Evaluation of Their Antioxidant Properties Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers (IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.",1
"Domestic processing of onion bulbs (Allium cepa) and asparagus spears (Asparagus officinalis): effect on flavonol content and antioxidant status Two commonly consumed plant foods, onion bulbs and asparagus spears, were subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping, maceration, and boiling. The impact of these processes on flavonol content was assessed. Further, the consequences of these processes on the antioxidant capacity of the tissues were evaluated with the beta-carotene bleaching method. Chopping significantly affected rutin content in asparagus, yielding an 18.5% decrease in 60 min; but in onions, quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside (Q(DG)) and quercetin 4'-glucoside (Q(MG)) were virtually unaffected by chopping. Boiling for 60 min had more severe effects, as it caused overall flavonol losses of 20.6 and 43.9% in onions and asparagus, respectively. Chopping of tissues did not considerably influence the antioxidant capacity, but boiling did provoke notable changes.",1

"Green tea flavan-3-ols: colonic degradation and urinary excretion of catabolites by humans Following the ingestion of green tea, substantial quantities of flavan-3-ols pass from the small to the large intestine (Stalmach et al. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, 53, S44-S53; Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200900194). To investigate the fate of the flavan-3-ols entering the large intestine, where they are subjected to the action of the colonic microflora, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate were incubated in vitro with fecal slurries and the production of phenolic acid catabolites was determined by GC-MS. In addition, urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites was investigated over a 24 h period after ingestion of either green tea or water by healthy volunteers with a functioning colon. The green tea was also fed to ileostomists, and 0-24 h urinary excretion of phenolic acid catabolites was monitored. Pathways are proposed for the degradation of green tea flavan-3-ols in the colon and further catabolism of phenolic compounds passing into the circulatory system from the large intestine, prior to urinary excretion in quantities corresponding to ca. 40% of intake compared with ca. 8% absorption of flavan-3-ol methyl, glucuronide, and sulfate metabolites in the small intestine. The data obtained point to the importance of the colonic microflora in the overall bioavailability and potential bioactivity of dietary flavonoids.",1

"Contents of phenolic acids, alkyl- and alkenylresorcinols, and avenanthramides in commercial grain products The contents of free and total phenolic acids and alk(en)ylresorcinols were analyzed in commercial products of eight grains: oat (Avena sativa), wheat (Triticum spp.), rye (Secale cerale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), and corn (Zea mays). Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg (whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes (26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols (524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).",0
"Urinary total flavonoid excretion but not 4-pyridoxic acid or potassium can be used as a biomarker for the intake of fruits and vegetables To gain better insight into the potential health effects of fruits and vegetables, reliable biomarkers of intake are needed. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of flavonoid excretion in both 24-h and morning urine samples to reflect a low intake and moderate changes in fruit and vegetable consumption. Furthermore, the urinary excretions of 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) and potassium were investigated as other potential biomarkers of fruit and vegetable intake. The study was designed as a 5-d randomized, controlled crossover study. On d 1-3, the men (n = 12) consumed a self-restricted flavonoid-free diet. On d 4, they were provided a strictly controlled diet containing no fruits or vegetables (basic diet). On d 5, they consumed the basic diet supplemented with 300 or 600 g of fruits and vegetables. The total excretion of flavonoids in 24-h urine samples increased linearly with increasing fruit and vegetable intakes (r(s) = 0.86, P < 1 x 10(-6)). The total excretion of flavonoids in morning urine also increased, but the association was weaker (r(s) = 0.59, P < 0.0001). Urinary 4-PA in 24-h and morning urine samples increased significantly only with the 600-g increase in fruit and vegetable intake, whereas the excretion of potassium in urine did not reflect the changes in fruit and vegetable intake. We conclude that the total excretion of flavonoids in 24-h urine may be used as a new biomarker for fruit and vegetable intake.",1
"HPLC analysis of sesaminol glucosides in sesame seeds An HPLC method was developed and validated for the quantification of sesaminol triglucoside and a sesaminol diglucoside in sesame seeds. These two lignans were isolated, and their structures were characterized by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Defatted sesame flour was extracted first with 85% ethanol for 5 h followed by 70% ethanol for 10 h at room temperature using naringenin as internal standard. Analysis of 65 different samples of sesame seeds indicated that the content of sesaminol triglucoside ranged from 36 to 1560 mg/100 g of seed (mean 637 +/- 312) and that of sesaminol diglucoside ranged from 0 to 493 mg/100 g of seed (mean 75 +/- 95). No significant difference was found between sesaminol glucoside contents in black and white seeds.",1

"Tissue distribution of isoflavones in ewes after consumption of red clover silage When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.",0
"Lignan content of selected foods from Japan Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in food to Eastern diets.",0
"Antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of some leafy vegetables Some leafy vegetables were studied for their nutritional composition, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities.

"Antioxidant activity of the main phenolic compounds isolated from hot pepper fruit (Capsicum annuum L.) Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.",1
"Determination of matairesinol in flax seed by HPLC with coulometric electrode array detection A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on +150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.",0
"Lignan and isoflavonoid concentrations in tea and coffee Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.",1
"Hydroxytyrosol disposition in humans Animal and in vitro studies suggest that phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil are effective antioxidants.

"Activity and concentration of polyphenolic antioxidants in apple: effect of cultivar, harvest year, and storage conditions Consumers' increasing interest in the relationship between diet and health is a sign for food producers to pay more attention to potential health-protecting compounds in new product development and food processing. From a production chain perspective the choice of the raw material that is used is important for the health-protecting potential of the end product. Four apple cultivars (Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Cox's Orange, and Elstar), which can be used as fresh apples or in processed apple products, were compared with regard to flavonol, catechins, phloridzin, and chlorogenic acid concentrations and antioxidant activity. Jonagold apples possessed the highest flavonoid concentration and the highest antioxidant activity. To study seasonal differences, apples from three different harvest years were analyzed, but in three cultivars no effect on flavonoid concentration and antioxidant activity was observed. Long-term storage, both at refrigerator temperature and under controlled atmosphere conditions, was found not to influence flavonoid concentration or antioxidant activity.",1
"Antioxidant activity of plant extracts containing phenolic compounds The antioxidative activity of a total of 92 phenolic extracts from edible and nonedible plant materials (berries, fruits, vegetables, herbs, cereals, tree materials, plant sprouts, and seeds) was examined by autoxidation of methyl linoleate. The content of total phenolics in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). Among edible plant materials, remarkable high antioxidant activity and high total phenolic content (GAE > 20 mg/g) were found in berries, especially aronia and crowberry. Apple extracts (two varieties) showed also strong antioxidant activity even though the total phenolic contents were low (GAE < 12.1 mg/g). Among nonedible plant materials, high activities were found in tree materials, especially in willow bark, spruce needles, pine bark and cork, and birch phloem, and in some medicinal plants including heather, bog-rosemary, willow herb, and meadowsweet. In addition, potato peel and beetroot peel extracts showed strong antioxidant effects. To utilize these significant sources of natural antioxidants, further characterization of the phenolic composition is needed.",1

"Identification and quantification of metabolites of orally administered naringenin chalcone in rats Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.",1
"Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tatricum Gaertn.) as a source of dietary rutin and quercitrin Two samples of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) from China and one from Luxembourg were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to reveal the possibilities of growing tartary buckwheat herb as a possible source of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin. The content of rutin was determined as up to 3% dry weight (DW) in tartary buckwheat herb. Quercitrin values were in the range of 0.01-0.05% DW. Only traces of quercetin were detected in just some of the samples. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained more rutin (about 0.8-1.7% DW) than common buckwheat seeds (0.01% DW). Rutin and quercetin content in seeds depends on variety and growing conditions. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained traces of quercitrin and quercetin, which were not found in common buckwheat seeds.",0
"GC-MS methods for metabolic profiling of microbial fermentation products of dietary polyphenols in human and in vitro intervention studies Flavonoids, a subclass of polyphenols, are major constituents of many plant-based foods and beverages, including tea, wine and chocolate. Epidemiological studies have shown that a flavonoid-rich diet is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the flavonoids survive intact until they reach the colon where they are then extensively metabolized into smaller fragments. Here, we describe the development of GC-MS-based methods for the profiling of phenolic microbial fermentation products in urine, plasma, and fecal water. Furthermore, the methods are applicable for profiling products obtained from in vitro batch culture fermentation models. The methods incorporate enzymatic deconjugation, liquid-liquid extraction, derivatization, and subsequent analysis by GC-MS. At the level of individual compounds, the methods gave recoveries better than 80% with inter-day precision being better than 20%, depending on the matrix. Limits of detection were below 0.1 microg/ml for most phenolic acids. The newly developed methods were successfully applied to samples from human and in-vitro intervention trials, studying the metabolic impact of flavonoid intake. In conclusion, the methods presented are robust and generally applicable to diverse biological fluids. Its profiling character is useful to investigate on a large scale the gut microbiome-mediated bioavailability of flavonoids.",1

"Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry identification of proanthocyanidins in rat plasma after oral administration of grape seed extract Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective effects of GSE.",1
"Red chicories as potent scavengers of highly reactive radicals: a study on their phenolic composition and peroxyl radical trapping capacity and efficiency Eight varieties of Cichorium genus vegetables (five heavily red colored, one red spotted, and two fully green) were investigated for their phenolic content (by HPLC and UV-vis spectrophotometry) and for their antioxidant activity. In particular, the capacity (that is, the amount of trapped peroxyl radicals) and the efficiency (that is, the amount of antioxidant necessary to halve the steady-state concentration of peroxyl radicals) were measured. All of the studied chicories are characterized by the presence of a large amount of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, whereas the red color is due to cyanidin glycosides. The presence of these phenolics in red chicories confers to them an exceptionally high peroxyl radical scavenging activity in terms of both capacity and efficiency, particularly in their early stage of growth, and makes this popular and low-cost foods comparable or superior to many foods having well-known antioxidant properties such as red wine, blueberry, and tomato.",1
"Capillary electrophoretic determination of resveratrol in wines A rapid and sensitive capillary electrophoretic method for analysis of resveratrol in wine was established. The protocol consists of sample preparation using a C-18 solid-phase extraction cartridge. Baseline separation of trans- and cis-resveratrol from other compounds in wine was achieved in approximately 8 min using a micellar mode. The limits of detection for trans- and cis-resveratrol were 0.1 and 0.15 micromol/L, respectively. Recovery rates for trans-resveratrol using the protocol described ranged from 94.6 +/- 8.5 to 101.9 +/- 7.2%. These procedures were used to analyze the trans- and cis-resveratrol levels in 26 wines. It was found that the concentration of trans-resveratrol ranged from 0.987 to 25.4 micromol/L, whereas the concentration of cis-resveratrol was much lower.",0

"The phenolic fraction of maize bran: evidence for lignin-heteroxylan association Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.",1
"Fast separation and determination of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and other phenolic compounds in extra-virgin olive oil by capillary zone electrophoresis with ultraviolet-diode array detection Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.",0
"Polyphenols in wild and weedy Mexican common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and health.",0
"Quantification of polyphenolics and their antioxidant capacity in fresh plums Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of 11 cultivars of fresh plums were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Identification and quantification of individual polyphenolics were performed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. The total phenolic contents of various cultivars widely varied from 125.0 to 372.6 mg/100 g expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The level of total flavonoids in fresh plums ranged between 64.8 and 257.5 mg/100 g expressed as catechin equivalents. Antioxidant capacity, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), ranged from 204.9 to 567.0 mg/100 g with an average of 290.9 mg/100 g of fresh weight. Cv. Beltsville Elite B70197 showed the highest amounts of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the highest VCEAC. A positive relationship (correlation coefficient r (2)() = 0.977) was presented between total phenolics and VCEAC, suggesting polyphenolics would play an important role in free radical scavenging. The level of IC(50) value of superoxide radical anion scavenging activity of the plum cultivars ranged from 13.4 to 45.7 mg of VCEAC/100 g. Neochlorogenic acid was the predominant polyphenolic among fresh plums tested. Flavonols found in plum were commonly quercetin derivatives. Rutin was the most predominant flavonol in plums. Various anthocyanins containing cyanidin aglycon and peonidin aglycon were commonly found in all plums except for cv. Mirabellier and NY 101.",1

"Quantitation of trans-resveratrol and detection of its metabolites in human plasma and urine by high performance liquid chromatography We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and UV detection (325 nm) to determine levels of resveratrol and identify six major conjugated metabolites in the plasma and urine of human volunteers after administration of a single oral dose of 1g. Waters Atlantis C18 3 microm served as the stationary phase. The gradient was formed using ammonium acetate and methanol, containing 2% propan-2-ol. Detection is linear between 5 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL in plasma (5-1000 ng/mL in urine). The coefficient of variation for intra- and inter-day variation is <10%. The average recovery of resveratrol from plasma and urine is 58+/-3%. The data presented in this report demonstrate a rapid, sensitive and accurate method for the analysis of resveratrol and its metabolites in human plasma and urine for pharmacokinetic studies.",1
"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content in leaf extracts of tree spinach (Cnidoscolus spp.) Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species (Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of natural antioxidants for foods.",1
"Structural determinants of plant lignans for the formation of enterolactone in vivo The quantity of mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) and of plant lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) excreted in a 24-h rat urine sample was measured after a single p.o. dose of an equivalent quantity of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG), secoisolariciresinol (SECO), matairesinol (MR), 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) and ENL. Plant lignans (SECO and HMR) were partially absorbed as such. The aglycone form of SECO was more efficiently converted into mammalian lignans END and ENL than the glycosylated form, SDG. Of plant lignans, MR produced the highest quantities of ENL: the quantity was over twofold compared with HMR or SDG. The majority of the animals, which had been given SECO, excreted higher quantities of END than ENL into urine, but ENL was the main lignan metabolite after SDG. The highest quantities of ENL in urine were measured after the administration of ENL as such. The (-)SECO isolated from Araucaria angustifolia was converted into (-)ENL only. The administration of (-)SDG, which was shown to produce (+)SECO, resulted in excretion of (+)ENL only and (-)HMR was converted into (-)ENL only. This confirmed that the absolute configurations at C8 and C8' are not changed during the microbial metabolism. Whether the biological effects are enantiomer-specific, remains to be resolved.",1
"A new process to develop a cocoa powder with higher flavonoid monomer content and enhanced bioavailability in healthy humans Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are warranted.",1

"Comparative contents of dietary fiber, total phenolics, and minerals in persimmons and apples Dietary fibers, major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements in persimmons and apples were analyzed and compared in order to choose a preferable fruit for an antiatherosclerotic diet. Fluorometry and atomic absorption spectrometry following microwave digestion were optimized for the determination of major phenolics and minerals. Total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibers, total phenols, epicatechin, gallic and p-coumaric acids, and concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.",1
"Importance of insoluble-bound phenolics to antioxidant properties of wheat Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or +/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 +/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is essential.",0

"Different profiles of quercetin metabolites in rat plasma: comparison of two administration methods The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.",1
"Antioxidants, low molecular weight carbohydrates, and total antioxidant capacity in strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa): effects of cultivar, ripening, and storage Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage. This information should make it possible to select strawberries with an optimal content of bioactive compounds.",1
"Antioxidant capacity and phytochemical content of herbs and spices in dry, fresh and blended herb paste form We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.",1
"Secoiridoids, tocopherols, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils extracted from destoned fruits The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.",0
"Investigation of the metabolic fate of dihydrocaffeic acid The antioxidant dihydrocaffeic acid is a dietary constituent and a microbial metabolite of flavonoids. Orally administered to rats, dihydrocaffeic acid was very rapidly absorbed most probably by the gastric or duodenal epithelium and excreted in urine as free and conjugated forms. LC-MS2 analysis of plasma and urine samples allowed confident identification of the dihydrocaffeic acid metabolites. The parent compound was glucuronidated, sulphated or methylated, on one of the hydroxyl groups present on its phenyl ring. All the dihydrocaffeic acid metabolites peaked in plasma within the first 30min following ingestion, suggesting a metabolism possibly by the gastric or duodenal cells and by the liver. Using in vitro and ex vivo models of the intestinal epithelium and the liver, the identity and source of the metabolites detected in vivo were examined. The data obtained suggest that, in rats, intestinal cells are more able to glucuronidate dihydrocaffeic acid, whereas liver favours sulphation. Moreover, glucuronidation, sulphation and methylation seem to be regio-selective, preferably on the 3-OH of dihydrocaffeic acid. The methyl conjugate, dihydroferulic acid, was shown to be oxidized into ferulic acid by intestinal and hepatic cells, which were also able to perform the reverse reaction, the reduction of ferulic acid into dihydroferulic acid. As a conclusion, the main form of dihydrocaffeic acid circulating in plasma after its ingestion is a mixture of different primary and secondary metabolites.",1
"Resveratrol metabolites in urine as a biomarker of wine intake in free-living subjects: The PREDIMED Study Several clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that moderate wine consumption may exert a protective effect against oxidative stress involved in several diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the epidemiological assessment of wine consumption has usually been obtained using self-reported questionnaires containing less reliable information for assessing total intake than nutritional biomarkers. A reliable biomarker for wine consumption is, therefore, needed. To validate urinary resveratrol metabolites (RMs) as a biomarker of wine consumption in a large cohort of free-living subjects, 1000 consecutive subjects entering a substudy of the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) were evaluated. Data were collected in a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. RMs were measured in morning urine by LC-MS/MS. Urinary RM values correlated directly with reported daily amounts of wine consumed (r=0.895; p<0.001). One drink of wine per week can be detected. Using a cut-off of 411.4 nmol/g creatinine, the measurement of urinary RMs could discriminate wine consumers from non-wine consumers with a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91.5-94.7%) and a specificity of 92.1% (CI 90.2-93.7%). Urinary RMs fulfill the criteria to be considered as a nutritional biomarker of wine consumption in a large sample of free-living subjects. This biomarker would provide an additional tool for investigating more precisely the relationship between wine consumption and health benefits.",1

"HPLC-DAD-ESIMS analysis of phenolic compounds in nectarines, peaches, and plums The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl (350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant (125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially rich in phenolics.",1
"Factors affecting the caffeine and polyphenol contents of black and green tea infusions The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared according to the instructions given on their packaging.",0

"RP-HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using a CoulArray detector Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved identification of natural antioxidants.",1
"Effect of ripeness and postharvest storage on the phenolic profiles of cherries (Prunus avium L.) The phenolic compounds hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavan-3-ols of sweet cherry cultivars Burlat, Saco, Summit, and Van harvested in 2001 and 2002 were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Phenolics were analyzed at partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these compounds.",0

"Influence of cultivar, maturity, and sampling on blackberry (Rubus L. hybrids) anthocyanins, polyphenolics, and antioxidant properties Total anthocyanin pigments increased from 74.7 to 317 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW) from underripe to overripe for Marion blackberries and from 69.9 to 164 mg/100 g FW for Evergreen blackberries. Total phenolics did not show a marked change with maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant activities, while increasing with ripening, also did not show the marked change that total anthocyanins exhibited. The impact of variation due to plots, subsampling, sample preparation, and measurement on Marion composition was examined in detail. Plot-to-plot and sample differences were the major contributors to variation, with sample preparation being an important contributor for some parameters. Measurement variation was a relatively small component of the total variation. Total anthocyanins for 11 blackberry cultivars ranged from 131 to 256 mg/100 g FW (mean = 198), total phenolics ranged from 682 to 1056 mg GAE/100 g FW (mean = 900), oxygen radical absorbance capacity ranged from 37.6 to 75.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 50.2), and ferric reducing antioxidant power ranged from 63.5 to 91.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 77.5).",0
"Hydroxytyrosol excretion differs between rats and humans and depends on the vehicle of administration Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt (5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be carefully formulated.",1
"Identification of the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat urine by HPLC-MS/MS To identify the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat, rat urine samples were pretreated by using solid-phase extraction technique (SPE) with polyamide cartridges. And a LC-MS/MS method with electrospray ionisation (ESI), negative ion mode and collision induced dissociation (CID), was used to elucidate the structures of the major metabolites of resveratrol. According to the results of our experiment, we found that the main metabolites of resveratrol were resveratrol monoglucuronide (M1), dihydroresveratrol monosulfate (M2), resveratrol monosulfate (M3) and dihydroresveratrol (M4).",1
"Relative bioavailability of the flavonoids quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin given simultaneously through diet The bioavailability and urinary excretion of three dietary flavonoids, quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin, were investigated. Ten healthy men were asked to consume a 'juice mix' containing equal amounts of the three flavonoids, and their urine and plasma samples were collected. The resulting mean plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-48 h) and C(max) values for quercetin and hesperetin were similar, whereas the AUC(0-48 h) of naringenin and, thus, the relative bioavailability were higher after consumption of the same dose. The study consolidates a significantly lower urinary excretion of quercetin (1.5+/-1%) compared with hesperetin (14.2+/-9.1%) and naringenin (22.6+/-11.5%) and shows that this is not due to a lower bioavailability of quercetin, but rather reflects different clearance mechanisms.",1
"Inhibition of induced DNA oxidative damage by beers: correlation with the content of polyphenols and melanoidins Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin (1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation. Furthermore, a correlation between the total melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7309, p < 0.01) and inhibition of 8-OH-dG was observed.",1

"Structural identification of novel glucoside and glucuronide metabolites of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in mouse urine using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside metabolite of EGCG in mammals.

"Three-year comparison of the content of antioxidant microconstituents and several quality characteristics in organic and conventionally managed tomatoes and bell peppers Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol (17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol (20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.",1
"Quantitative analysis of xanthohumol and related prenylflavonoids in hops and beer by liquid chromatography_tandem mass spectrometry A method for quantitation of six prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, desmethylxanthohumol, 6- and 8-prenylnaringenins and 6-geranylnaringenin) in hops and beer by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The method allows direct analysis of beer and crude methanolic extracts of hops. After HPLC separation, prenylflavonoids were detected by positive ion multiple-reaction monitoring using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated nebulizer--atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The accuracy and precision were evaluated by replicate analyses of (spiked) samples. Thirteen commercial beers were analysed with the method. Isoxanthohumol, formed by isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process, was the most abundant flavonoid in hopped beers, ranging from 0.04 to 3.44 mg/l.",1
"Polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of seed coat and cotyledon from Brazilian and Peruvian bean cultivars (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was more related to the total phenolic content.",1
"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of spinach as affected by genetics and growing season Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.",1
"Urinary excretion of anthocyanins in humans after cranberry juice ingestion Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.",1
"High absorption but very low bioavailability of oral resveratrol in humans The dietary polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to have chemopreventive activity against cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers in model systems, but it is not clear whether the drug reaches the proposed sites of action in vivo after oral ingestion, especially in humans. In this study, we examined the absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of 14C-resveratrol after oral and i.v. doses in six human volunteers. The absorption of a dietary relevant 25-mg oral dose was at least 70%, with peak plasma levels of resveratrol and metabolites of 491 +/- 90 ng/ml (about 2 microM) and a plasma half-life of 9.2 +/- 0.6 h. However, only trace amounts of unchanged resveratrol (<5 ng/ml) could be detected in plasma. Most of the oral dose was recovered in urine, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis identified three metabolic pathways, i.e., sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation of the phenolic groups and, interestingly, hydrogenation of the aliphatic double bond, the latter likely produced by the intestinal microflora. Extremely rapid sulfate conjugation by the intestine/liver appears to be the rate-limiting step in resveratrol's bioavailability. Although the systemic bioavailability of resveratrol is very low, accumulation of resveratrol in epithelial cells along the aerodigestive tract and potentially active resveratrol metabolites may still produce cancer-preventive and other effects.",0
"Lignan content of selected foods from Japan Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in food to Eastern diets.",1
"Antioxidant activity of different phenolic fractions separated from an Italian red wine Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.",0
"Alkylperoxyl radical scavenging activity of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) phenolics Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA > DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.",0
"Quantitative changes in phenolic content during physiological development of the olive (Olea europaea) cultivar Hardy's Mammoth This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.",1
"Structures of (-)-epicatechin glucuronide identified from plasma and urine after oral ingestion of (-)-epicatechin: differences between human and rat (-)-epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human diet. Particularly high levels are found in black tea, apples, and chocolate. High intake of catechins has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. There have been several reports concerning the bioavailability of catechins, however, the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in blood, tissues, and urine remains unclear. In the present study, we purified and elucidated the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in human and rat urine after oral administration. Three metabolites were purified from human urine including (-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-5 or 7-O-glucuronide, according to 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMBC, and LC-MS analyses. The metabolites purified from rat urine were 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide, and 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide. These compounds were also detected in the blood of humans and rats by LC-MS. The presence of these metabolites in blood and urine suggests that catechins are metabolized and circulated in the body after administration of catechin-containing foods.",1
"Sesamin is one of the major precursors of mammalian lignans in sesame seed (Sesamum indicum) as observed in vitro and in rats Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to mammalian lignans is suggested.",1
"Different radical scavenging tests in virgin olive oil and their relation to the total phenol content Four different antioxidant tests (ABTS*+, DPPH, ORAC, beta-carotene-linoleate model system) were used to determine the free-radical scavenging activity of 39 extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) and compare the total phenol content by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The correlation between the total phenols and antioxidant capacities measured by the four methods was very high, and highest with ABTS*+ (R2 = 0.9905). Some of these methods of measurement were applied to olive-oil samples (OO), with approximately a 50% decrease in the value of the antioxidant capacity in comparison with values found for EVOO. In conclusion, the results show that all the methods tested were suitable for determining the antioxidant capacity of olive oil. The Picual variety of extra-virgin olive oil showed high antioxidant activity.",1
"Comparative content of some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 +/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 ). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and other diseases.",0
"Dietary flaxseed supplementation ameliorates inflammation and oxidative tissue damage in experimental models of acute lung injury in mice Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P = 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.",1
