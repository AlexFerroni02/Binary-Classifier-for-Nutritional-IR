"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive neoplasm derived from B and/or T cell lineage (B-ALL; T-ALL). For the first time, this study describes, cytogenetically, the karyotypic alterations in adults with ALL in the northern region of Brazil and their relationship with hematological and biochemical characteristics. Through banding analyses, immunophenotyping, as well as hematological and biochemical examination data obtained directly from patients' records, we found that chromosome 21 aneuploidy was the most frequent. The cytogenetic structural alterations observed with the highest incidence among the patients were: t(9;22), t(4;11), t(1;19), del(6q), and del(9p). In patients presenting with chromosome alterations, we verified that patients with t(4;11) have elevated red blood cell levels and patients with del(9p) presented with distinct and high values of hematological parameters compared to other patients. Regarding biochemical alterations, we observed that patients with translocations (4;11) and del(6q) presented with elevated urea levels compared to other patients, highlighting its relationship to kidney changes and patient prognosis. Thus, our study highlights that variations in hematological and biochemical data are associated with specific cytogenetic changes and other factors, which may impact the prognosis of adult patients with ALL.",0
"A direct injection-HPLC method, based on existing methods, slightly modified, was used to analyse commercially available wines in the Greek market for their trans -resveratrol content. Red wines produced from French, or French and Greek cultivars were found to have relatively higher amounts of trans -resveratrol compared with those produced exclusively from native Vitis vinifera cultivars. However, the wines produced from the original Greek Vitis vinifera cultivars, Kotsifali and Mantilaria, appeared to contain important amounts of trans -resveratrol. White wines were found to have markedly lower concentrations of this stilbene in comparison with red wines.",1
"Recent reports have demonstrated various cardiovascular and neurological benefits associated with the consumption of foods rich in anthocyanidins. However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue distribution are only beginning to accumulate. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels reaching 0.5 and 0.15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the overall uptake of the administered pelargonidin was 18 % after 2 h, with the majority of the detected levels located in the stomach. However, the amounts recovered dropped to 1.2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered pelargonidin.",1
"Cancer is the leading cause of disease-related mortality in children. Causes of leukemia, the most common form, are largely unknown. Growing evidence points to an origin in-utero, when global redistribution of DNA methylation occurs driving tissue differentiation. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was profiled in surrogate (blood) and target (bone marrow) tissues at birth, diagnosis, remission and relapse of pediatric pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL) patients. Double-blinded analyses was performed between prospective cohorts extending from birth to diagnosis and retrospective studies backtracking from clinical disease to birth. Validation was carried out using independent technologies and populations. The imprinted and immuno-modulating VTRNA2-1 was hypermethylated (FDR<0.05) at birth in nested cases relative to controls in all tested populations (totaling 317 cases and 483 controls), including European and Hispanic ancestries. VTRNA2-1 methylation was stable over follow-up years after birth and across surrogate, target and other tissues (n=5,023 tissues; 30 types). When profiled in leukemic tissues from two clinical cohorts (totaling 644 cases), VTRNA2-1 methylation exhibited higher levels at diagnosis relative to controls, it reset back to normal levels at remission, and then re-increased to above control levels at relapse. Hypermethylation was significantly associated with worse pre-B ALL patient survival and with reduced VTRNA2-1 expression (n=2,294 tissues; 26 types), supporting a functional and translational role for VTRNA2-1 methylation. This study provides proof-of-concept to detect at birth epigenetic precursors of pediatric pre-B ALL. These alterations were reproducible with different technologies, in three continents and in two ethnicities, and can offer biomarkers for early detection and prognosis as well as actionable targets for therapy.",0
"The antioxidant potential of eight clingstone peach cultivars was investigated by determining phenolic compounds and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. Cultivars low in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were also selected to minimize enzymatic browning. Inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 17.0 to 37.1% in peach flesh extract, from 15.2 to 49.8% in whole peach extract, and from 18.2 to 48.1% in peel extract. Total phenols were 432.8-768.1 mg/kg in flesh extract, 483.3-803.0 mg/kg in whole extract, and 910.9-1922.9 mg/kg in peel extract. The correlation coefficient between relative LDL antioxidant activity and concentration of total phenols was 0.76. Peel PPO activity was higher than flesh activity in most cultivars. The lowest PPO and specific activities were found in the Walgant cultivar, followed by Kakamas and 18-8-23. These three cultivars combine the desirable characteristics of strong antioxidant activity, low PPO activity, and lower susceptibility to browning reactions.",1
"Prednisone response (PR) remains a key early treatment indicator in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, its independent prognostic significance has waned with the advent of minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided risk assessment. Evaluating the enduring biological and clinical significance of PR, especially in high-risk subtypes, could enhance the precision of therapeutic approaches. This retrospective study analyzed clinical data from 2,979 pediatric patients primarily diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and enrolled in the South China Children's Leukemia Group (SCCLG-ALL)-2016 Collaborative Group between October 2016 and June 2023. Patients were categorized into ""good prednisone response"" (GPR) and ""poor prednisone response"" (PPR) groups based on their response to prednisone. Clinical characteristics were compared between groups using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was employed to analyze the correlation between prednisone response and early minimal residual disease (MRD). Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and prognostic factors were evaluated using Cox regression models. Among the 2,979 patients, 2,649 were categorized as GPR and 330 as PPR. Children in the PPR group exhibited multiple high-risk clinical features and had a poorer prognosis than those in the GPR group. However, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that days 15 and 33 MRD had a stronger predictive value than prednisone response. Notably, PR showed strong predictive value for MRD positivity on both Day 15 and Day 33. In this large real-world Chinese cohort, PR was not an independent prognostic marker but was strongly associated with early MRD burden. These findings support the contextual use of PR as a practical surrogate for MRD in resource-limited settings, and highlight the need to reconsider its role in modern risk-adapted treatment strategies.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is an effective salvage therapy for pediatric relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), yet is challenged by high rates of post-CAR relapse. Literature describing specific relapse patterns and extramedullary (EM) sites of involvement in the post-CAR setting remains limited, and a clinical standard for post-CAR disease surveillance has yet to be established. We highlight the importance of integrating peripheral blood minimal residual disease (MRD) testing and radiologic imaging into surveillance strategies, to effectively characterize and capture post-CAR relapse. Here, we describe the case of a child with multiply relapsed B-ALL who relapsed in the post-CAR setting with gross non-contiguous medullary and EM disease. Interestingly, her relapse was identified first from peripheral blood flow cytometry MRD surveillance, in context of a negative bone marrow aspirate (MRD <0.01%). Positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose revealed diffuse leukemia with innumerable bone and lymph node lesions, interestingly sparing her sacrum, the site of her bone marrow aspirate sampling. We highlight this case as both peripheral blood MRD and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging were more sensitive than standard bone marrow aspirate testing in detecting this patient's post-CAR relapse. Clinical/Biologic Insight: In the multiply relapsed B-ALL setting, where relapse patterns may include patchy medullary and/or EM disease, peripheral blood MRD and/or whole body imaging, may carry increased sensitivity at detecting relapse in patient subsets, as compared with standard bone marrow sampling.",0
"The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate sources.",1
"Although telomere length maintenance is a common characteristic of hematological malignancies, the role of telomere length as a prognostic factor to stratify acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients depending on their risk of relapse remains elusive. This knowledge gap motivated us to examine telomere length values in children with ALL at the time of diagnosis and after treatment using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) ( The results demonstrated statistically significant evidence of telomere shortening in the lymphoblasts of children with ALL but not in the lymphocytes of children after remission following treatment. Our findings also suggested a significant association between telomere shortening and a high risk of relapse disease. Last but not least, our preliminary results showed a trend that telomere shortening was more pronounced in children with B-ALL compared to those with T-ALL in a non-significant manner. Consequently, the current study provides preliminary insights into the potentially substantial prognostic value of telomere length in the progression of pediatric ALL, with the possibility of predicting treatment response. To clarify the application of telomere length as a possible biomarker for disease progression and treatment response in children with ALL, the telomere length values of additional participants need to be examined in further studies.",0
"Over the past decade, CAR T cell therapy has transformed the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-ALL in children and adults. CD19-directed CAR T cells can induce complete remissions in a large majority of patients with B-ALL, and up to half of these patients will go on to maintain durable remissions. However, significant challenges remain for patients who relapse or do not respond. This review will discuss the history of CAR T cell therapy for B-ALL, the treatment considerations for CAR T cell recipients, and current clinical trials and future directions for CAR T cell therapy in B-ALL.",0
"Various genetic aberrations are suggested to initiate the development of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) but alone are insufficient for disease onset. Epigenetic alteration, such as DNA methylation changes, plays a key role in human health. Evidence suggests DNA methylation may be an intermediate mechanism through which the environment contributes to ALL manifestation. ALL is categorized into subtypes based on leukaemia-associated genetic events, and it is plausible that different exposures pose differing risks for given subtypes. Using our previously established meet-in-the-middle approach, we performed CpG-level analysis to investigate DNA methylation as an intermediate mechanism between risk exposures and ALL. Differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) were integrated, identifying overlapping methylation, with hypergeometric tests used to assess the probability of concurring methylation considering directionality. DMC analysis reinforced previous gene-level findings suggesting altered DNA methylation associated with maternal radiation exposure, alcohol intake, and plasma folate during pregnancy is also present in the disease. Whilst maternal folate-associated and leukaemia-associated methylation appear consistent across most subtypes, the effect of other exposures appears subtype-specific. We suggest environmentally associated methylation includes driver and/or 'navigator' changes, the latter influencing biological pathways contributing to ALL. This analysis aids understanding of which risk factors may contribute to specific subtypes or which influence ALL risk more generally.",0
"Methotrexate (MTX) is a key component of treatment for high-risk pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but may cause acute kidney injury and prolonged hospitalization due to delayed clearance. The purpose of this study is to identify clinical and genetic factors that may predict which children are at risk for creatinine increase and prolonged MTX clearance. We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients with ALL who received 4000-5000 mg/m Hispanic ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) < 3%, BMI between 85%-95%, and Native American genetic ancestry were found to be associated with an increased risk for creatinine elevation. Older age, Black race, and use of the intensive monitoring protocol were associated with a decreased risk for creatinine elevation. Older age, B- compared to T-ALL, and the minor alleles of rs2838958/SLC19A1 and rs7317112/ABCC4 were associated with an increased risk for delayed clearance. Black race, MTX dose reduction, and the minor allele of rs2306283/SLCO1B1 were found to be associated with a decreased risk for delayed clearance. These predictors of MTX toxicities may allow for more precise individualized toxicity risk prediction.",0
"Germination and fermentation have been proposed to improve the nutritive value of legumes. This paper reports the changes that occur in phenolic compounds in lentils (Lens culinaris var. vulgaris) during germination and fermentation. Levels of low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds (benzoic acids and aldehydes, hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, flavan-3-ols and procyanidins) were determined. Germination did not appreciably vary the content of phenolic compounds, although important structural changes in procyanidin-type compounds were observed. Fermentation led to a general increase in the content of phenolic compounds. Gentisic acid, p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, tryptophol and three other unknown compounds were detected in fermented lentils, but not in raw lentils. The influence of these changes on the potential antinutritional effects associated with phenolic compounds in legumes, as well as on the antioxidant properties attributed to these compounds is discussed.",1
"Consumer demand for softer leaves with variation in taste, shape and colours has encouraged the development of new lettuce products of baby-sized leaves. The objective of this study was the comparison of whole-head lettuce, as the most common raw material for fresh-cut, with baby-leaf and multi-leaf as the newest baby-sized lettuce leaves. Lettuces (Lactuca sativa L.) of the types Green Leaf, Red Leaf and Lollo Rosso were cultivated in the same field with different plant densities, under commercial conditions. Although baby-leaf was subjected to far less wound damage than the shredded lettuce from the whole-head, leaf age could play an important role in increasing respiration rate and determining postharvest quality. After 9–11d of storage, minimally processed products from the three types of raw material showed good visual quality without differences among them. However, over the 12-d storage period, quality decreased to the limit of marketability mainly due to browning of the cut edge surface of the fresh-cut product from whole-heads and decay due to the soft tissue in the case of baby-leaves. Additionally, with the processing of whole-heads, the increase in cut-damage surfaces and availability of cell nutrients provided conditions that favoured the growth of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and total coliforms compared to uncut surfaces of baby-sized leaves. The ratio between the oxidized and reduced forms of ascorbate (DHA/AA) increased 2–4 times after 9–11d of storage. Furthermore, baby-sized leaves had higher phenolic contents than the shredded product from the whole-head which probably contributed to reaching a shelf-life of 11d. In conclusion, the new green and red baby-sized leaves both at immature and mature stages provided high quality lettuce for the fresh-cut market, meeting specific requirements regarding visual quality, microbial load and high content of phytochemicals.",1
"Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone values of 47-3099 microg/g.",1
"In 21 varieties of stone and pome fruit the quinic acid esters of caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids have been determined by capillary GC and HPLC. The total content of hydroxycinnamoylquinic acids was found to be between 80 and almost 900 ppm fr. wt. The results confirm that the main hydroxycinnamic acid compound in pome fruit is 5′-caffeoylquinic acid, whereas in stone fruit it is 3′-caffeoylquinic acid. Our investigations also show the regular occurrence of 3′-p-coumaroylquinic acid in stone fruit species. In sweet and sour cherries it can be the main component in concentrations of 100–200 ppm. Significant amounts of feruloylquinic acid are only found in plums and apricots. The 4′-isomers of all acids occur only in very small concentrations with the exception of 4′-p-coumaroylquinic acid in apples, the content of which exceeds that of 5′-p-coumaroylquinic acid.",1
"The BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved the outcomes of patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the optimal duration of TKI therapy in patients who achieve a complete molecular response (CMR; undetectable BCR::ABL1 transcripts) and who do not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains undefined. The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with Ph-positive ALL in first complete remission who achieved a CMR and discontinued TKI therapy, most commonly due to treatment-related side effects. In total, 14 patients were identified. The regimen of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine was the primary backbone chemotherapy and was received by 12 patients (86%) combined with either imatinib (14%), dasatinib (43%), or ponatinib (29%) during induction. Two patients received blinatumomab and ponatinib. The median duration of TKI therapy was 60 months. The median CMR duration before TKI discontinuation was 46.1 months (range, 2.7-121.3 months). After a median follow-up of 42.5 months from TKI discontinuation, three patients (21%) experienced relapse (two molecular, one morphologic), whereas 11 patients (79%) maintained treatment-free remission. The median time to relapse was 6.4 months (range, 4-16 months), and two of three relapsed patients regained CMR after resuming TKI therapy. Importantly, none of the six patients with a CMR duration >48 months before TKI discontinuation relapsed. The current findings suggest that TKI discontinuation may be safe for highly selected patients with Ph-positive ALL in first complete remission who maintain CMR for at least 48 months. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.",0
"The blasts in most cases of chronic myeloid leukemia blast phase (CML-BP) have a myeloid or precursor-B immunophenotype, with only a small subset having T-cell or natural killer-cell lineage. Patients with CML-BP having early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) are extremely rare. We report the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic features and outcome of 3 patients with CML-BP who had ETP-ALL, with a review of the literature. Only patient 1 had a history of chronic myeloid leukemia chronic phase. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed BCR::ABL1 rearrangement in cells with round nuclei (blasts) and cells with segmented nuclei (neutrophils) in cases 2 and 3, supporting a diagnosis of CML-BP rather than de novo Ph+ ETP-ALL. The blasts were positive for cytoplasmic CD3, CD7, CD33, and CD117; were negative for CD1a and CD8; and had dim CD5 expression in 2 cases. Next-generation sequencing showed a TET2 mutation in case 1 and BCOR, RUNX1, and STAG2 mutations in case 3. All patients received chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients 2 and 3 died 33 days and 39 days, respectively, after diagnosis. Patient 1 received stem cell transplantation and was alive 14 months after blast phase. Patients with CML-BP may have ETP-ALL. These patients usually have an aggressive clinical course, requiring intensive therapy, and may benefit from stem cell transplantation.",0
"The objective of this study was to report the results of a bibliometric analysis on the modern corpus of literature pertaining to endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). Prior bibliometrics studies on ETV have focused on highly cited articles, but an advanced bibliometric analysis has not yet been conducted. The authors queried the Web of Science (WoS) for (ALL = (endoscopic third ventriculostomy)) OR (ALL = (ETV) AND ALL = (neurosurgery)). Articles or reviews published in English were included. Articles, along with their metadata, were exported. Statistical, bibliometric, and network analyses were performed using the Bibliometrix R package and various Python packages. Reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS), a method that analyzes the frequency with which references are cited in terms of these references' publication years, was employed to explore the historical roots of the field. Between 1994 and 2023, 1663 documents were identified (1382 articles) from 5457 authors. The mean annual growth rate of publications was 4.9%. International coauthorship increased 4-fold over this time period and was noted for 18.95% of published studies from 2011 to 2023. We observed that Child's Nervous System published the most articles, Journal of Neurosurgery (JNS) articles were cited most frequently, and JNS: Pediatrics articles had the highest impact. Female coauthorship increased from < 1% of published studies before 2000 to 19% by 2022, with an increase in female first authorship from 2% in 2005 to 22% in 2022 and at least 1 female coauthor rising from 3% in 2000 to 68% in 2022. Likewise, minority authorship has increased, as in the early ETV literature > 75% of authors were White while currently only 43% are White. The authors of this study also identified the most prolific authors on the subject. Early in the publication record, etiological and technical terms such as ""aqueductal stenosis"" and ""technical note"" predominated. More recently, ""complications,"" ""failure,"" ""success,"" ""neuroendoscopy,"" and ""choroid plexus cauterization"" were prominent. Utilizing RPYS, the authors identified 32 articles that comprise the foundational articles on ETV, published between 1966 and 2010. Interest in ETV increased in the 1990s with the advent of advanced endoscopic technologies-particularly digital video. The focus of research has shifted from etiology to outcomes, complication management, and technical mastery.",0
"The next-generation sequencing technologies application discovers novel genetic alterations frequently in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RAS signaling pathway mutations at the time of relapse ALL frequently appear as small subclones at the time of onset, which are considered as the drivers in ALL relapse. Whether subclones alterations in the RAS signaling pathway should be considered for risk group stratification of ALL treatment is not decided yet. In this work, we investigate the RAS signaling pathway mutation spectrum and the related prognosis in pediatric ALL. We employed an NGS panel comprising 220 genes. NGS results were collected from 202 pediatric ALL patients. 155 patients (76.7%) harbored at least one mutation. The incidences of RAS signaling pathway mutations are different significantly between T-ALL and B-ALL. In B-ALL, the RAS pathway is mostly involved, and NRAS (17.6%), KRAS (22.7%), and PTPN11 (7.7%) were the three most frequently mutated genes. Co-occurring mutations of CREBBP and NRAS, FLT3, or PTPN11 (p = 0.002, p = 0.009, and p = 0.003, respectively) were found in this cohort. The 3-year RFS rates for the RAS signaling pathway mutation-positive and negative cases was 76.5 % versus 89.7 % (p = 0.012). Four cases relapsed in the lately 3 years were RAS signaling pathway mutation-positive. RAS signaling pathway mutation is an important biomarker for poorer relapse-free survival in pediatric B-ALL patients despite good early MRD levels.",0
"Tisagenlecleucel is a CD19-directed autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays are highly sensitive in defining in vivo kinetics by measuring CAR transgene in peripheral blood. This study aimed to identify clinically meaningful CAR T-cell blood levels that correlated with response/relapse. In pediatric/young adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), maximum CAR T-cell blood levels were higher in patients with ongoing complete remission and in patients with CD19- relapse relative to those with CD19+ relapse. In adult patients with R/R diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), no apparent association between in vivo kinetics and response was noted, with a wide range of transgene levels at relapse. In B-ALL, patients with B-cell aplasia sustained >6 months had higher CAR T-cell expansion relative to those with early B-cell recovery (BCR) (<6 months after infusion); however, a definitive cutoff for BCR-associated expansion level could not be identified. In most patients with B-ALL, BCR >6 months maintained favorable responses. However, early BCR could not be confirmed as a potential indicator of relapse due to high censoring from transplant, following presumed risk of relapse. However, allografting in these patients may potentially mitigate the poor prognosis related to early BCR. In DLBCL, BCR was not associated with relapse. These findings suggest that blood CAR transgene levels may be associated with long-term responses; however, they lack robust predictive potential for relapses. As reported earlier, next-generation sequencing for minimal residual disease appears to be a reliable biomarker predictive of relapse for B-ALL.",0
"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1), catalyzing post-transcriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, promotes cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. However, very little is known about the association of ADAR1 variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we first explored the potential association of three polymorphisms (rs9616, rs2229857, and rs1127313) of ADAR1 with susceptibility in Chinese children ALL, then functionally characterized ADAR1 in ALL. Our results demonstrated that rs9616 T and rs2229857 T were associated with increased expression of ADAR1 mRNA and higher risk to ALL. Of note, a stronger risk effect of rs2229857 T genotypes was found among relapse children. Furthermore, ADAR1 knockdown specifically inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in ALL cells. These findings give insights into a mechanism by which the risk variant at rs9616 and rs2229857 modulate ADAR1 expression and confers a predisposition and relapse risk to ALL, and representing a potential novel biomarker for pediatric ALL.",0
"Polyphenols present in red table grape varieties Red Globe, Flame Seedless, Crimson Seedless, and Napoleon, and the white varieties Superior Seedless, Dominga, and Moscatel Italica were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS. The anthocyanins peonidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside (and their corresponding p-coumaroyl derivatives), malvidin 3-glucoside, petunidin 3-glucoside, and delphinidin 3-glucoside were found. In addition, caffeoyltartaric acid, p-coumaroyltartaric acid, and the flavonols quercetin 3-glucuronide, quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-galactoside, kaempferol 3-glucoside, and isorhamnetin 3-glucoside were detected. Flavan-3-ols were also detected, and were identified as gallocatechin, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, procyanidin B4, procyanidin C1, catechin, and epigallocatechin. These phenolics were present only in the skin, as the flesh of these grape cultivars was almost devoid of these compounds. Anthocyanins were the main phenolics in red grapes ranging from 69 (Crimson Seedless) to 151 (Flame Seedless) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes, whereas flavan-3-ols were the most abundant phenolics in the white varieties ranging from 52 (Dominga) to 81 (Moscatel Italica) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes. Total phenolics ranged from 115 (Dominga) to 361 (Flame Seedless) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes. This means that a serving of unpeeled table grapes (200 g) could provide up to 72 mg of total phenolics (Flame Seedless). These results indicate that the intake of unpeeled table grapes should be recommended in dietary habits as a potential source of antioxidant and anticarcinogenic phenolic compounds.",1
"Brain tumor biopsies are essential for pathological diagnosis. However, hemorrhagic complications after biopsies may occur, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This study evaluated the relationship between intraoperative blood pressure, especially anesthesia awakening, and hemorrhagic complications after brain tumor biopsies. We retrospectively collected data on consecutive patients with brain tumors (malignant lymphoma or glioma) who underwent a biopsy from 2011 to 2020. During the first half of the study period (until 2015), we managed patients with a mild blood pressure-lowering policy during awakening from general anesthesia, while in the latter half (after 2016), we aggressively lowered blood pressure below 140 mmHg. This blood pressure management was performed as a best practice. After propensity score matching using logistic regression analysis, 122 patients were included. With the aggressive blood pressure-lowering policy, the values of blood pressure-related parameters during the recovery from general anesthesia were drastically reduced (median maximum blood pressures were 165 [mmHg] until 2015 vs. 135 after 2016, p < 0.001). Accordingly, the overall bleeding rate decreased after 2016 (ALL bleeding, 54.1 vs. 31.1%, p = 0.017; symptomatic bleeding, 16.4% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.154). Abrupt blood pressure rise during anesthesia awakening (mmHg/min) was significantly associated with symptomatic postsurgical hemorrhages (p = 0.012). An aggressive blood pressure-lowering policy reduced blood pressure during recovery from general anesthesia and the overall bleeding rates. Avoiding rapid blood pressure rises during anesthesia awakening may be necessary by focusing on both blood pressure and the speed of any changes.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) stands out as the most prevalent neoplasm during childhood, characterized by the rapid production of abnormal lymphoid cells. Chemotherapy administered to these patients may induce a substantial imbalance in the oral microbiota. A prospective pediatric study encompassing a control group (without ALL) and ALL patients at two treatment stages (pre-induction and consolidation) was conducted. Clinical and laboratory data were meticulously collected. Moreover, DNA from saliva samples was extracted for 16S rRNA sequencing. Clinical data revealed a heightened incidence of oral mucositis during the consolidation phase. Analysis of alpha biodiversity (observed taxa) exhibited a significant reduction in bacterial richness among patients in the consolidation phase. Network analysis identified key taxa during this phase, namely Neisseria flavescens, Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas. The findings underscore the substantial impact of ALL treatment on the oral microbiota composition, indicating diminished bacterial diversity and an elevated prevalence of oral mucositis.",0
"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) variants on thiopurine metabolites, DNA-incorporated thioguanine nucleotides (DNA-TG), erythrocyte thioguanine nucleotides (Ery-TGNs) and methyl mercaptopurine nucleotide (Ery-MMPN) levels, and the association among the levels of these 6-MP metabolites in Japanese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DNA-TG, Ery-TGNs, and Ery-MMPN levels were measured in 20 Japanese patients with childhood ALL (171 sampling points) on consecutive clinical visits, using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. NUDT15 was genotyped using Sanger sequencing. Three NUDT15 intermediate metabolizers (IM, *1/*2 or *1/*3) and two poor metabolizers (PM, *3/*3) were identified. DNA-TG/dose was significantly higher in PM than in normal metabolizers (NM). Intra-patient coefficients of variation (CV) of DNA-TG levels were similar in NUDT15 genotypes, and inter-patient CV was higher in IM and PM than in NM. The DNA-TG/Ery-TGNs ratio was higher in IM and PM than in NM (p < 0.01). The ranges of DNA-TG/dose and DNA-TG/Ery-TGNs ratio were not different within NUDT15 phenotypes. In NUDT15 NM, patients with high Ery-TGNs/dose showed high DNA-TG/dose. Absolute lymphocyte count was significantly correlated with DNA-TG, Ery-TGNs, and Ery-MMPN levels (p < 0.001). White blood cell counts were significantly correlated with Ery-TGNs levels (p < 0.02), and the levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases were significantly correlated with Ery-MMPN levels (p < 0.001). NUDT15 phenotype is a strong factor for thiopurine trialability in Japanese children with ALL. Ery-TGNs levels may associate with difference of individual response.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a major new treatment option for children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYA) patients with relapsed and refractory (R/R) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Therefore, accumulating evidence from real-world experiences of CAR-T outcomes in various regions worldwide is important, particularly when comparing outcomes of patients with differing medical and ethnic backgrounds. More than 5 years have passed since tisagenlecleucel was approved in Japan. Here, we report a retrospective, multi-institutional investigation examining the association between baseline parameters and clinical outcomes. The aim was to investigate real-world experience and to better comprehend the efficacy of commercial tisagenlecleucel. A nationwide consortium called the Japan CAR-T Consortium conducted a retrospective, multicenter study of CAYA patients who received CAR-T cell treatment with commercial tisagenlecleucel. Forty-two patients with R/R B-ALL whose leukapheresis samples were shipped to Novartis for commercial tisagenlecleucel manufacture were included in the analysis. All infused patients were included in the response, toxicity, and survival analyses. The best overall response rate was 93%. The 1-year overall survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates after infusion were 82% and 56%, respectively. Twenty-seven (64%) had low disease burden (LB, defined as <5% bone marrow [BM] lymphoblasts) prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion. LB was associated with superior outcomes, with a 1-year EFS rate of 80% compared with 24% in high disease burden (≧5% BM lymphoblasts). Multivariate analysis identified an association between prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (n = 23, 55%) and superior outcomes, with a 1-year EFS rate of 75% compared with 24% for patients without prior HSCT. This first analysis of CAYA patients with R/R B-ALL undergoing treatment with commercial tisagenlecleucel in Japan reports an efficacy similar to that in clinical trials and other real-world studies and confirms that LB and prior HSCT are associated with superior EFS.",0
"'Ready-to-eat' breakfast cereals and raw, baked, and cooked cereal products were analyzed for alkylresorcinols. The finely ground, dried samples were extracted with acetone; the alkylresorcinols from each extract were separated by HPLC. A photodiode array detector was set at 280 nm to monitor the eluted compounds; subsequently, the spectrum of each compound was plotted from 240 to 340 nm to confirm the identity of the separated alkylresorcinols. The results indicate that, on a moisture-free basis wheat bran, wheat bran enriched, or whole wheat breakfast cereals contained much higher levels (343-1455 micrograms/g) than breads or bran muffins (61-217 micrograms/g). Total alkylresorcinols in a typical serving of cereal-based foods varied from 40 (wheat bran breakfast cereal) to 1 mg (1 slice of 7-grain bread or rye bread)",1
"In the field of medicine, decision support systems play a crucial role by harnessing cutting-edge technology and data analysis to assist doctors in disease diagnosis and treatment. Leukemia is a malignancy that emerges from the uncontrolled growth of immature white blood cells within the human body. An accurate and prompt diagnosis of leukemia is desired due to its swift progression to distant parts of the body. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive type of leukemia that affects both children and adults. Computer vision-based identification of leukemia is challenging due to structural irregularities and morphological similarities of blood entities. Deep neural networks have shown promise in extracting valuable information from image datasets, but they have high computational costs due to their extensive feature sets. This work presents an efficient pipeline for binary and subtype classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The proposed method first unveils a novel neighborhood pixel transformation method using differential evolution to improve the clarity and discriminability of blood cell images for better analysis. Next, a hybrid feature extraction approach is presented leveraging transfer learning from selected deep neural network models, InceptionV3 and DenseNet201, to extract comprehensive feature sets. To optimize feature selection, a customized binary Grey Wolf Algorithm is utilized, achieving an impressive 80% reduction in feature size while preserving key discriminative information. These optimized features subsequently empower multiple classifiers, potentially capturing diverse perspectives and amplifying classification accuracy. The proposed pipeline is validated on publicly available standard datasets of ALL images. For binary classification, the best average accuracy of 98.1% is achieved with 98.1% sensitivity and 98% precision. For ALL subtype classifications, the best accuracy of 98.14% was attained with 78.5% sensitivity and 98% precision. The proposed feature selection method shows a better convergence behavior as compared to classical population-based meta-heuristics. The suggested solution also demonstrates comparable or better performance in comparison to several existing techniques.",0
"CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T lymphocytes (CAR-T) has demonstrated a high proportion of complete remission in the treatment of relapsed refractory acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL). It is of great clinical significance to explore which factors will impact long-term disease-free survival of patients with r/r B-ALL after CAR-T therapy without bridging bone marrow transplantation. Our study found that, in patients with r/r B-ALL without bridging transplantation, the patients' age; infusion dosage; whether they had undergone allo-stem cell transplantation before CAR-T therapy, using CD-19-targeted or CD19/CD22-dual-targeted CAR-T; whether there is fusion gene; tumor burden before therapy; and comorbidity had no significant relationship with their long-term disease-free survival. We found only that CAR-T persistence was highly correlated with patients' long-term disease-free survival. So, we further profiled CAR-T cells using single-cell sequencing and found that there is a specific T cell subset that may be associated with the long-term persistence of CAR-T. Finally, according to the single-cell sequencing results, we established cell production process named PrimeCAR, which shared common signaling pathways with the T cell subset identified. In the preliminary clinical study, prime CAR-Ts yield good persistence in peripheral blood of patients with B-ALL and lymphoma, without observing grade 2 or higher cytokine release syndrome.",0
"The DUX4 gene, located within repetitive subtelomeric arrays on chromosomes 4 and 10, plays a critical role in early embryogenesis and has been implicated in several human diseases, including facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and cancer. In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), DUX4 rearrangements (DUX4-r) define a distinct genomic subtype affecting 5-10% of cases, which is more frequent among older children and teenagers. These rearrangements produce truncated DUX4 proteins with neomorphic transcriptional activity, resulting in aberrant gene expression programs and alternative splicing that disrupt normal B-cell precursor development. Patients with DUX4-r B-ALL often present with poor initial treatment responses, though they typically achieve excellent long-term survival rates with intensive chemotherapy regimens. The cryptic nature of DUX4 rearrangements has historically posed significant challenges to accurate detection, but recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies, including RNA and long-read sequencing, and improved immunophenotyping strategies-such as the use of CD371 as a surrogate marker-are enhancing diagnostic accuracy. This review explores the genetic and biological features of DUX4 and its rearrangements, shedding light on their role in leukemogenesis and associated clinical outcomes. Additionally, we highlight emerging technologies that enable the detection of DUX4-r and discuss their implications for clinical use and research. An improved understanding of DUX4 biology and its oncogenic potential may pave the way for novel treatment strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for patients with DUX4-r B-ALL.",0
A new high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for chlorogenic acid determination in sunflower seeds is described. This method offers a relatively rapid and highly selective way to separate chlorogenic acid from caffeic acid and other polyphenolic compounds in sunflower seeds. The HPLC method results are compared with those of the spectrophotometric method and no significant difference is shown between methods using confectionery seeds but significant differences are shown with the oilseed varieties.,1
"Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical regions.",1
"The release of ferulic acid and the subsequent thermal or enzymatic decarboxylation to 4-vinylguaiacol are inherent to the beer production process. Phenolic, medicinal, or clove-like flavors originating from 4-vinylguaiacol frequently occur in beer made with wheat or wheat malt. To evaluate the release of ferulic acid and the transformation to 4-vinylguaiacol, beer was brewed with different proportions of barley malt, wheat, and wheat malt. Ferulic acid as well as 4-vinylguaiacol levels were determined by HPLC at several stages of the beer production process. During brewing, ferulic acid was released at the initial mashing phase, whereas moderate levels of 4-vinylguaiacol were formed by wort boiling. Higher levels of the phenolic flavor compound were produced during fermentations with brewery yeast strains of the Pof(+) phenotype. In beer made with barley malt, ferulic acid was mainly released during the brewing process. Conversely, 60-90% of ferulic acid in wheat or wheat malt beer was hydrolyzed during fermentation, causing higher 4-vinylguaiacol levels in these beers. As cereal enzymes are most likely inactivated during wort boiling, the additional release of ferulic acid during fermentation suggests the activity of feruloyl esterases produced by brewer's yeast.",1

"Therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (tr-ALL) is a disease entity attributed to previous exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiation for antecedent malignancy. There is observed female predominance for tr-ALL, likely due to high prevalence and excellent curable rate for non-metastatic breast cancer as well as the frequent use of carcinogenic agents as part of adjuvant therapy. Here, we reviewed 37 women with diagnosis of ALL following breast cancer treatment with focus on cytogenetic categorization. Philadelphia chromosome positivity (Ph+), KMT2A alterations and other cytogenetic change groups were observed in 32%, 22% and 46% of patients respectively. Median overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 19.4 and 12.9 months, overall while both OS and RFS were superior in tr-ALL with Ph+ disease compared to KMT2Ar and other cytogenetics respectively. Seventeen (45.9%) patients underwent consolidative allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in CR1 out of which 4 (24%) relapsed following transplant. Both OS and RFS were superior in the KMT2Ar cytogenetics group following alloHCT. Ph chromosome represents the largest genetic entity of tr-ALL following breast cancer therapy, and it may be associated with superior survival outcomes while KMT2Ar may be associated with poorer outcomes that can perhaps be mitigated by alloHSCT.",0
"The biological benefits of olive oil in preventing the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) would seem to be linked to its high monounsaturated fatty acid contents, but also to its respective phenolic compounds contents. One prerequisite to assess the in vivo physiological significance of phenolic compounds is to determine their presence in human LDL following the ingestion of virgin olive oil. In this work, olive oil phenolic metabolites were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) detection, after solid phase extraction (SPE). Quantitative methods were developed in carrying out linearity, precision, sensitivity and recovery tests. The results from two methods of LDL separation were compared and shorter LDL isolation procedure showed a better recovery for antioxidants compounds in LDL. The metabolites identified in LDL were: hydroxytyrosol monoglucuronide, hydroxytyrosol monosulfate, tyrosol glucuronide, tyrosol sulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate. The fact that olive oil phenolic metabolites are able to bind LDL strengthens claims that these compounds act as in vivo antioxidants.",1
"Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in conventional and ecological white wine. In contrast with other studies, the total concentrations of phenolic compounds in conventional and ecological red and white wines were not related to antioxidant activity (p > 0.05). In red wines, no significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity of ecological and conventional red wine (p = 0.28), while in white wine significant differences were observed in the antioxidant activity between conventional and ecological white wine (p = 0.006).",1
"Visual inspection of peripheral blood samples is a critical step in the leukemia diagnostic process. Automated solutions based on artificial vision approaches can accelerate this procedure, while also improving accuracy and uniformity of response in telemedicine applications. In this study, we propose a novel GBHSV-Leuk method to segment and classify Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cancer cells. GBHSV-Leuk is a two staged process. The first stage involves pre-processing, which uses the Gaussian Blurring (GB) technique to blur the noise and reflections in the image. The second stage involves segmentation using the Hue Saturation Value (HSV) technique and morphological operations to differentiate between the foreground and background colors, which improve the accuracy of prediction. The proposed method attains 96.30% accuracy when applied on the private dataset, and 95.41% accuracy when applied on the ALL-IDB1 public dataset. This work would facilitate early detection of ALL cancer.",0
"The effect of boiling and steaming on content of phytochemicals (carotenoids, chlorophylls, polyphenols and ascorbic acid) all evaluated by HPLC, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) measured by means of TEAC and FRAP assays and colour (L∗, a∗, b*, C, H°) of three frozen vegetables (carrot, cauliflower and spinach) was evaluated. Steaming increased the content of polyphenols in all vegetables and limited the depletion of carotenoids in spinach. Accordingly, TAC remained unvaried or increased both for steamed carrot and spinach. Boiling had a more marked effect on nutritional pattern of frozen vegetables in comparison with steaming, leading to a general loss of phytochemical compounds and TAC for all vegetables. Ascorbic acid was detected only in cauliflower and decreased after both treatments. Colour of frozen vegetables was only slightly influenced by cooking, probably due to blanching pre-treatment. Slight decrements of redness (a∗) for carrot in relation with loss of carotenoids and greenness (−a∗) for steamed spinach, due to a significant loss of total chlorophylls, were observed. Steaming increased TAC and bioaccessibility of polyphenols in all frozen vegetables while boiling led to a general loss of carotenoids and phenolic compounds and a TAC decrease.",1
"Infiltration of malignant cells into the central nervous system in hematological malignancies correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Investigations into the penetration of venetoclax into the central nervous system have been limited. We report venetoclax pharmacokinetics in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples from a Phase 1 study in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory malignancies that demonstrate venetoclax ability to cross into the central nervous system. Venetoclax was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, with concentrations ranging from < 0.1 to 26 ng/mL (mean, 3.6 ng/mL) and a plasma:CSF ratio ranging from 44 to 1559 (mean, 385). Plasma:CSF ratios were comparable among patients with AML and ALL and no clear trend was observed in the ratios over the course of treatment. Moreover, improvement in central nervous system (CNS) involvement status was observed in patients who had measurable concentrations of venetoclax in the CSF. CNS resolution was observed for up to six months while on treatment. These findings highlight the potential role of venetoclax and provide the opportunity to further investigate its utility in improving clinical outcomes for patients with CNS complications.",0

"Phenolic compounds have long been associated with flavour and colour characteristics of fruits and vegetables and actually attract a great interest due to their health protecting properties. In this work, the influence of different power input of microwave baking on the amount of protocatechuic acid (1), tryptophan (2), chlorogenic acid (3), neo-chlorogenic acid (4), and cryptochlorogenic acid (5) marker compounds left over in peeled and not-peeled potatoes (Solanum tuberosus L., Agria cultivar) was assessed. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify compounds 1–5. Other tubers were used to perform analysis of raw potato (control) and traditional baking potatoes products (boiled potatoes). Dielectric behavior of the irradiated tubers was also investigated to emphasize if microwaves treatments are suitable for food processing in terms of nutritional factor preservation. The main results of this work consist on the relevance of the water contents in potato matrixes during the baking processes since these have a crucial role to keep lossy features, to avoid thermal damages and to preserve antioxidant. The best compromise in terms of short baking time and reduced water and phenolic losses is obtained using 500 W as power input.",1
"The possibility of proving the authenticity of apricot nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint. Phenol composition of the raw material (apricots and apples), their purees, apricot nectars and jams (with and without addition the definite shares of apple puree) prepared under laboratory conditions and commercial apricot nectars and jams has been determined by high performance liquid chromatography with the UV-Diode Array detection. In addition to large number of various phenol compounds contained in an apples, characteristic marker compounds of the dihydrochalcone group (phloretin 2′-xylosylglucoside and phloretin 2′-glucoside), could be determined. By using the mentioned compounds, undeclared apple admixture in the apricot based products could be detected. The cheaper admixture of the apple puree (⩾10%) in the apricot nectars could be proved by using phloretin 2′-glucoside and phloretin 2′-xylosyglucoside, and only by using phloretin 2′-glucoside if apple puree was added in relatively low level about 5%. The undeclared admixture of apple puree in apricot jams could be detected by both mentioned dihydrochalcones if apple puree was added in level above 20%, and only by phloretin 2′-glucoside if apple puree was added in level about 10%.",1
"Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < .01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant capacity in a healthy population.",1

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematological cancer that can cause ocular tissue involvement. Asparaginase is a chemotherapy regimen that is commonly used in leukemia which could lead to similar ocular manifestations. We report a patient with a history of ALL for seven months on asparaginase therapy and persistent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis (CSVT) with acute venous infarction in the left frontal lobe presented with worsening vision. On examination, he had a visual acuity (VA) of (6/21) in the right eye and (6/60) in the left eye, with a mild left eye abduction limitation. Fundal examination showed bilateral prominent multilayered retinal hemorrhages and papilledema with absence of leukemic infiltration. His chemotherapy regimen was held and a one month follow up was scheduled. Follow up after one month of chemotherapy cessation showed resolution of both VA and fundal exam findings. It is crucial to differentiate between asparaginase toxicity and infiltration of the disease in ALL patients. As this would determine whether the treatment should be continued or suspended.",0
"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a multifactorial disease that results from the interaction between multiple genetic factors. ALL is characterized by uncontrolled production of hematopoietic precursor cells of the lymphoid progenitors within the bone marrow. The development of hematological malignancies has been associated with malignant-like cells that express low levels of immunogenic surface molecules, thus, facilitating their escape from cellular antineoplastic immune responses. This risk may be partly influenced by variations in polymorphic genes that control immune function and regulation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are well known pattern recognition receptors playing key role in innate immune response. Abnormal expression and dysregulation of TLRs will provide an opportunity for cancer cells to escape from the immune system and enhance their proliferation and angiogenesis. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) play an essential role in innate immunity. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are present in a number of TLR genes and have been associated with various disorders. In this study, 265 subjects have been divided into two groups included 150 patients with ALL and115 healthy volunteers. All subjects were genotyped using TaqMan PCR techniques. In total, Five SNPs were statistically evaluated in the TLR2 (rs1898830 A/G, rs3804099 T/C, rs3804100 T/C, rs1339 T/C, and rs1337 C/G), which may influence the susceptibility of ALL. Minor allele frequency and genotype distribution were compared across the study groups, and the relative risk and differences between patients and controls were estimated. Moreover, the mRNA expression level was evaluated in patients with ALL and the matched healthy individuals by Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). TLR2 rs1898830 A/G; rs3804099 T/C; rs3804100 T/C; rs1339 T/C, were significantly decrease the risk in our population, overall and for certain subtypes and ALL samples exhibited significant increase in the mRNA levels of TLR2. This study shows that TLR2 could be an independent prognostic factor of ALL risks in the Saudi population. Suggesting that genetic variation in genes associated with an immune response may be important in the etiology of ALL. In addition, the results herein revealed that TLR2 overexpression is associated with ALL and has diverse biological significance in the context of the complex relationship between inflammation and cancer development. Therefore, these data could open further studies to explore the possible clinical relevance of TLRs as pathological markers for Leukemia and enhance the strategies regarding hematological malignancies prevention based on their gene expression.",0

"In the present study the content of 15 polyphenols was determined in 55 samples of red wines from different denominations of origin in the Canary Islands (Spain) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV and fluorescence detection. The most important differences in content among wines according to different categories (island, zone and denomination of origin) were established. In general, red wines from the Canary Islands had a content in polyphenols in the lower part of the range considered normal. The exception was quercetin, with a mean content (17.5 mg/l) higher than in other wines, which may be a peculiarity of these particular wines. The principal component analysis (PCA) technique was used to study the latent structure. A good differentiation among wines according to their production area was obtained using linear discriminant analysis (LDA).",1
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in children with hematological malignancies. Although AKI due to infiltration of tumor cells in children is rare, it negatively impacts treatment outcomes and increases the risk of mortality. We introduce a case of a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who experienced kidney relapse resulting in asymptomatic AKI after remission from treatment, to remind clinicians not to overlook the primary disease in clinical judgment. In cases of unexplained AKI, kidney biopsy should be performed when feasible to get an accurate diagnosis and scientific treatment.

"The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell (Tc) immunotherapy in refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) suggests adaptation of this strategy toward HIV. Because cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine vectors generated Tc responses that controlled viral replication, these studies aim to genetically modify CMV-specific Tc with HIV-CAR2 vectors and link HIV immunotherapy to persistent CMV antigen stimulation. To mimic a clinical scenario, rhesus macaques were challenged with the CCR5-tropic simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-D) prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Autologous CMV-specific Tc were transduced with the control CEA-CAR2 or CD4-CAR2/maC46 vectors and reinfused.

"The effects of hyper-oxygenation and storage period of Macabeo and Airén white wines on color characteristics, phenolic, and volatile composition have been evaluated. Hyper-oxygenation treatment provoked a significant decrease in virtually all individual phenolic compounds in must, young wine, and one-year-aged wines, above all hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonols, and the new GRP derivatives compounds (derived from 2-S-glutathionyl-caftaric acid or grape reaction product). Despite this fact, the contribution of the yellow color component (b*) of white wines derived from hyper-oxygenated musts was significantly higher in comparison with untreated ones, even after 1 year of bottle storage. On the other hand, the concentration of major volatile compounds and some alcohols (namely, C6 alcohols, terpenes, and lactones) was higher in wines derived from hyper-oxygenated musts, but the hyper-oxygenation effect on volatile profile deeply depended on the grape variety. After 1 year of bottle storage, the significant differences were maintained and the content of some long-chain esters increased as a consequence of oxygen addition.",1
"The composition of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) seed milling fractions depends upon the relative abundance of various seed tissues in each. Fancy (light) flour contains mainly central endosperm, while the bran milling fraction has seed coat and some embryo tissues. Phytate, found in protein bodies of embryo and aleurone cells, is the major storage form of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and some microelements in seeds. Phytic acid (35–38 g kg−1) and minerals are concentrated in bran, a milling fraction with high concentrations of phytate-rich tissues. Polyphenolics, including condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), are also concentrated in bran (11–15 g kg−1). Rutin is concentrated in the hull of common buckwheat (0.8–4.4 g kg−1). Rutin concentration is low (0.2–0.3 g kg−1) in groats of common buckwheat but higher (0.7–0.8 g kg−1) in bran containing hull fragments. Rutin is 300-fold more concentrated (81 g kg−1) in groats of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L) Gaertn) than in groats of common buckwheat. Only small amounts of quercetin were detected. Bran is a concentrated source of phytic acid and tannins, a consideration in consumption of large amounts of buckwheat bran for nutritional or medicinal purposes.",1

"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common type of childhood leukaemia with effective chemotherapeutic treatment. However, obesity has been associated with higher ALL chemoresistance rates and lower event-free survival rates. The molecular mechanism of how obesity promotes chemotherapy resistance is not well delineated. This study evaluated the effect of adipocyte maturation on sequestration and metabolism of chemotherapeutic drug daunorubicin (DNR). Using targeted LC-MS/MS multi-analyte assay, DNR sequestration and metabolism were studied in human preadipocyte and adipocyte cell lines, where expressions of DNR-metabolizing enzymes aldo-keto reductases (AKR) and carbonyl reductases (CBR) were also evaluated. In addition, to identify the most DNR-metabolizing AKR/CBR isoforms, recombinant human AKR and CBR enzymes were subject to DNR metabolism. The results were further validated by AKR-, CBR-specific inhibitors. This report shows that adipocyte maturation upregulates expressions of AKR and CBR enzymes (by 4- to 60- folds, p < .05), which is positively associated with enhanced sequestration and metabolism of DNR in adipocytes compared to preadipocytes (by ~30%, p < .05). In particular, adipocyte maturation upregulates AKR1C3 and CBR1, which are the predominate metabolic enzyme isoforms responsible for DNR biotransformation to its metabolites. Fat is an expandable tissue that can sequester and detoxify DNR when stimulated by obesity, likely through the upregulation of DNR-metabolizing enzymes AKR1C3 and CBR1. Our data partially explains why obese ALL patients may be more likely to become chemoresistant towards DNR, and provides evidence for potential clinical investigation targeting obesity to reduce DNR chemoresistance.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with a dismal prognosis related to refractory/relapsing diseases, raising the need for new targeted therapies. Activating mutations of interleukin-7-receptor pathway genes (IL-7Rp) play a proven leukemia-supportive role in T-ALL. JAK inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, have recently demonstrated preclinical efficacy. However, prediction markers for sensitivity to JAK inhibitors are still lacking. Herein, we show that IL-7R (CD127) expression is more frequent (∼70%) than IL-7Rp mutations in T-ALL (∼30%). We compared the so-called nonexpressers (no IL-7R expression/IL-7Rp mutation), expressers (IL7R expression without IL-7Rp mutation), and mutants (IL-7Rp mutations). Integrative multiomics analysis outlined IL-7R deregulation in virtually all T-ALL subtypes, at the epigenetic level in nonexpressers, genetic level in mutants, and posttranscriptional level in expressers. Ex vivo data using primary-derived xenografts support that IL-7Rp is functional whenever the IL-7R is expressed, regardless of the IL-7Rp mutational status. Consequently, ruxolitinib impaired T-ALL survival in both expressers and mutants. Interestingly, we show that expressers displayed ectopic IL-7R expression and IL-7Rp addiction conferring a deeper sensitivity to ruxolitinib. Conversely, mutants were more sensitive to venetoclax than expressers. Overall, the combination of ruxolitinib and venetoclax resulted in synergistic effects in both groups. We illustrate the clinical relevance of this association by reporting the achievement of complete remission in 2 patients with refractory/relapsed T-ALL. This provides proof of concept for translation of this strategy into clinics as a bridge-to-transplantation therapy. IL7R expression can be used as a biomarker for sensitivity to JAK inhibition, thereby expanding the fraction of patients with T-ALL eligible for ruxolitinib up to nearly ∼70% of T-ALL cases.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy with poor response to conventional therapy, derived from hematopoietic progenitors committed to T-cell lineage. Relapsed/Refractory patients account for nearly 20% of childhood and 45% of adult cases. Aberrant Notch signaling plays a critical role in T-ALL pathogenesis and therapy resistance. Notch inhibition is a promising therapeutic target for personalized medicine, and a variety of strategies to prevent Notch activation, including",0
"The use of haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplants (Haplo-HSCT) in adults has increased due to improved procedures that lower the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and Transplant-Related Mortality (TRM). In pediatrics, haploidentical transplants, whether performed with in vivo or in vitro T-cell depletion, are considered an alternative to conventional transplants from genoidentical or phenoidentical donors with bone marrow (BM), peripheral stem cell (PBSC). This review synthesizes current knowledge, highlighting a thorough analysis of pediatric data from Haplo-HSCT for malignancies. In brief, donor selection criteria are the same as those published for adults, and the conditioning used is primarily myeloablative. The incidence of severe GvHD is lower as compared to adults, but other complications, such as hemorrhagic cystitis, veno-occusive disease and cardiac toxicity are present, and long-term follow-up data is lacking. We provide comprehensive recommendations for transplant preparation in treating pediatric AML and ALL, focusing on the ""in vivo"" T-cell depletion approach with high-dose post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy).",0
"Mononuclear cell (MNC) collection is critical for paediatric patients undergoing cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In children, extracorporeal volume (ECV) often exceeds 15% of total blood volume (TBV), traditionally necessitating red blood cell (RBC) priming to reduce the risk of haemodynamic instability. However, RBC priming introduces allogenic blood exposure and related complications. This study evaluated the safety and feasibility of unprimed MNC collection in paediatric patients with ECV/TBV ratios greater than 15%. We retrospectively reviewed two paediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) who underwent MNC collection using the Spectra Optia system in continuous mononuclear cell collection mode. Both patients had ECV/TBV ratios of 16% and 17%, respectively. Vital signs and laboratory parameters were monitored throughout and after the procedures to assess for adverse events, haemodynamic instability, and need for transfusion. Both patients completed MNC collection without adverse reactions, interruptions, or clinically significant changes in vital signs. Post-procedural haemoglobin and platelet counts showed no major declines, and neither patient required transfusion. Collection efficiency met institutional standards, and no symptoms of hypovolemia or citrate toxicity were observed. Unprimed MNC collection can be safely performed in paediatric patients even when the ECV/TBV ratio exceeds 15%. With careful monitoring and procedural planning, this conservative strategy may reduce allogenic blood exposure without compromising safety or collection efficiency.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common hematologic malignancy in children. Current clinical diagnosis primarily relies on invasive detection methods, while molecular subtyping remains a complex and time-consuming process.

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer. Contributory factors such as inflammation and oxidative stress, in response to drug therapies, may induce premature aging and cellular senescence with a severe impact on cardiometabolic health. Premature immunoaging through cellular senescence can lead to lower thymic output of T-cell lymphocytes translated into lower circulating T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). We hypothesized TRECs levels are associated with diet quality and impacted by oxidative and inflammatory status in survivors of childhood ALL (cALL). Adolescents and young adults cALL survivors from the PETALE cohort (",0
"Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of (i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic microbiota.",1
"Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR) are a well-established treatment option for children and young adults suffering from relapsed/refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bridging therapy is used to control disease prior to start of lymphodepletion before CAR infusion and thereby improve efficacy of CAR therapy. However, the effect of different bridging strategies on outcome, side effects and response to CAR therapy is still poorly understood. In this retrospective, multinational study, real-world data were collected from 14 different sites in Germany, Austria and Switzerland on 88 patients receiving 93 2nd-generation CAR therapies. Bridging therapy was classified into the categories 1) no systemic therapy (15/93 treatments), 2) low-intensity therapy (38/93 treatments) and 3) high-intensity therapy (39/93 treatments). We analyzed the impact of bridging regimens on clinical outcome. Patients receiving a high-intensity bridging therapy had a significantly higher tumor burden at time of eligibility compared to patients treated with a low-intensity or no systemic bridging therapy. They suffered significantly more from bacterial adverse events and mucositis. Overall survival was significantly better for patients who did not receive any bridging therapy in comparison to patients who had been treated with a low- or high-intensity bridging regimen. In conclusion, in this retrospective cohort, high-intensity bridging therapy has not improved the outcome in terms of overall and progression-free survival in comparison to a low-intensity therapy. Yet, high-intensity bridging therapy was associated with more adverse events. Our study suggests that a low-intensity bridging regimen may be preferred whenever tumor burden and disease kinetics allow this treatment strategy.",0
"The total phenolic content (TPC), total antioxidant activity (TAA), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging capacity, inhibition of coupled oxidation in a β-carotene–linoleate model system, iron(II) chelation activity and inhibition of copper-induced oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein (hLDL) cholesterol of 80% ethanolic extracts of soft and hard winter wheat samples and their milling fractions, namely flour, germ, bran and shorts, were investigated. Soft wheat extracts examined demonstrated higher TPC and TAA compared to those of hard wheat extracts. The germ fraction possessed the highest TPC, followed by bran, shorts, whole grain and flour for both wheat types examined. The TAA of both wheat types showed similar results except that shorts performed better than bran in this assay. Free radical scavenging properties of whole grain and milling fractions of both soft and hard wheat samples were examined against DPPH radical. The germ and flour fractions demonstrated the highest and lowest DPPH radical scavenging activity, respectively, among wheat fractions. Wheat extracts were also efficient in preventing bleaching of β-carotene, which is also known to be free radical mediated. In the iron(II) chelation assay the flour extracts demonstrated excellent activity, while the germ extracts showed a weak activity. The trends were similar in both soft and hard wheat for the iron(II) chelation assay. Wheat extracts also inhibited copper-induced oxidation of hLDL. In LDL oxidation assay, wheat extracts performed better than the reference antioxidant, ferulic acid. Thus wheat phenolics may serve as effective antioxidative components as measured by in vitro techniques.",1
"Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers (IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.",1
"The carotenoid and phenolic acid contents in fresh, stored and processed (blanched, frozen and boiled) spinach were comparatively determined by spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The major carotenoids identified after HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene (18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid (1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type. After storage of spinach at different temperatures (4°C or -18°C) the amount of total phenolic compounds decreased by around 20%, while the amount of individual phenolic acids increased by four times on average.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have significantly advanced the treatment of cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma. Traditionally, T cells are collected from patients through leukapheresis, an expensive and potentially invasive process that requires specialized equipment and trained personnel. Although whole blood collections are much more technically straightforward, whole blood starting material has not been widely utilized for clinical CAR-T cell manufacturing, in part due to lack of manufacturing processes designed for use in a good manufacturing practice (GMP) environment. Collecting cellular starting material from whole blood without leukapheresis could reduce manufacturing complexity and cost, thereby improving accessibility to CAR-T cell therapy. Whole blood samples were collected from eight healthy donors and one pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patient. These samples were processed using the Sepax C-Pro (Cytiva) instrument to isolate mononuclear cells (MNCs) via density gradient separation. CAR-T cells were then manufactured from the isolated MNCs using a GMP-compliant 7-day protocol, whereby T cells were activated with anti-CD3 and IL-2, transduced with GMP lentiviral vector encoding a CD19/CD22 bispecific CAR, and expanded in gas permeable cell culture bags. The resulting CAR-T cells were then evaluated for their phenotypic and functional properties using flow cytometry, cytokine release and cytotoxicity assays. From an average 77.7 mL of whole blood from healthy donors (range = 29-96 mL), we isolated an average of 42.2 × 10 Therapeutically relevant doses of CD19/CD22 CAR-T cells can be successfully manufactured from whole blood. On average, 80 mL of whole blood yields enough CAR-T cells to create a single dose for a pediatric patient (50 kg) at a dosage of 1 × 10",0
"The effect of maternal habits during pregnancy has been studied to determine their association with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To synthesize current evidence on the association between maternal diet during pregnancy and the risk of childhood ALL. Overview of Systematic reviews (SRs) published until September 2023 were searched in MEDLINE (Pubmed), EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and LILACS databases. Effect estimates and meta-aggregate analysis results are presented according to maternal exposure subgroups: (I) alcohol; (II) animal protein; (III) coffee; (IV) fruits and vegetables consumption; and (V) folic acid supplementation. The risk of bias was assessed independently by two authors using the AMSTAR II tool. PROSPERO protocol CRD42023462391. Thirteen SRs were included; of these, according to the AMSTAR II tool, three were graded as high-quality, three as moderate-quality, five as low-quality, and two as critically low-quality reviews. The inclusion of meat (fish), fruits, and vegetables in the diet during pregnancy, as well as folic acid supplementation, seems to have a protective effect against the development of childhood ALL. In contrast, the daily frequency and amount of coffee consumption during pregnancy could influence the development of this type of cancer in the pediatric population. We did not find enough evidence supporting the association of alcohol as a risk factor of childhood ALL. The low certainty of the evidence found makes it impossible to establish clear associations between maternal exposure during pregnancy to any of the five nutritional factors here evaluated and the development of childhood ALL.",0
"Nine commercial varieties of tomato (Rambo, Senior, Ramillete, Liso, Pera, Canario, Durina, Daniella and Remate) produced in Spain were analysed for their lycopene content, content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity. The phenolic compounds were characterised as flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin) and hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic and p-coumaric acids). Antioxidant activity was measured using the DPPH and ABTS assays. The concentrations of lycopene and the various phenolic compounds as well as the antioxidant activity were significantly influenced by the tomato variety. Quercetin, the most abundant flavonoid, was found in concentrations ranging between 7.19 and 43.59 mg kg−1 fresh weight, while naringenin levels were lower than 12.55 mg kg−1. The most abundant hydroxycinnamic acid was chlorogenic acid, with values ranging from 14 to 32 mg kg−1 fresh weight, followed by caffeic acid, while p-coumaric and ferulic acids showed similar concentrations lower than 5 mg kg−1. The highest content of lycopene was found in Ramillete, Pera and Durina (>50 mg kg−1 fresh weight), while the concentration in the other varieties was between 50 and 30 mg kg−1, with the exception of Liso (less than 20 mg kg−1). The antioxidant activity of tomato extracts varied with the tomato variety and the assay method used. Individual compounds found to be significantly related to antioxidant capacity were lycopene and ferulic and caffeic acids, but not quercetin and chlorogenic acid.",1
"Ascorbic acid (AA) and total polyphenol content (TP) are important plant antioxidants with many healthy effects, such as 'scavengers of free radicals', they inhibit oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, lower cholesterol levels, decrease fragility of blood vessels and increase their permeability, decrease heart coronary risk, etc. One of important sources of these compounds in human nutrition are apples. In two years (1997 and 1998) was investigated ascorbic acid content (AA) and total polyphenol content (TP) in three apple varieties (Idared, Gloster and Ontario) cultivated under equal conditions on the experimental plot of Czech University of Agriculture in Prague-Suchdol. AA content was determined by titration method with 2,6-dichlorphenolindophenol and TP content spectrophotometrically with Folin-Ciocalteau's reagent. In two years' trials AA and TP contents were estimated immediately after harvest in September and then monthly during storage for six months at +5°C. Statistically high significant differences were determined both in AA and TP contents during storage period - there was observed meaningful AA and TP decrease. The highest antioxidant content showed in both years early variety Ontario (in average 12.05 mg/kg AA, 2011.5 mg/kg TP), the lowest semi-early variety Gloster (in average 5.45 mg/kg AA, 1738.0 mg/kg TP). In this context the variety Ontario is the most favourable. The highest decrease of AA content was in variety Ontario (-30.05 %rel), the lowest in variety Gloster (-22.93 %rel ); in TP contents were differences negligible (-27.14 and -27.82 %rel). In spite of this decrease were in Ontario variety both values after six months storage the most favourable (8.45 mg/kg AA, 1466.5 mg/kg TP). Results were statistically evaluated with F-test and t-test. There could be seen differences among varieties and years of cultivation, but these differences were under the level of statistical significance showing only apparent tendencies. While varietal differences in decreasing of AA content during storage were greater (in interval from -22.93 %rel in Gloster variety to -30.05 %rel in Ontario variety), decreasing of TP contents during storage was nearly the same (about -27 %rel of original content)",1
"Rosmarinic acid (RA) is contained in various Lamiaceae herbs used commonly as culinary herbs. Although RA has various potent physiological actions, little is known on its bioavailability. We therefore investigated the absorption and metabolism of orally administered RA in rats. After being deprived of food for 12 h, RA (50 mg/kg body weight) or deionized water was administered orally to rats. Blood samples were collected from a cannula inserted in the femoral artery before and at designated time intervals after administration of RA. Urine excreted within 0 to 8 h and 8 to 18 h post-administration was also collected. RA and its related metabolites in plasma and urine were measured by LC-MS after treatment with sulfatase and/or beta-glucuronidase. RA, mono-methylated RA (methyl-RA) and m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in plasma, with peak concentrations being reached at 0.5, 1 and 8 h after RA administration, respectively. RA, methyl-RA, caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) and COA were detected in urine after RA administration. These components in plasma and urine were present predominantly as conjugated forms such as glucuronide or sulfate. The percentage of the original oral dose of RA excreted in the urine within 18 h of administration as free and conjugated forms was 0.44 +/- 0.21% for RA, 1.60 +/- 0.74% for methyl-RA, 1.06 +/- 0.35% for CAA, 1.70 +/- 0.45% for FA and 0.67 +/- 0.29% for COA. Approximately 83% of the total amount of these metabolites was excreted in the period 8 to 18 h after RA administration. These results suggest that RA was absorbed and metabolized as conjugated and/or methylated forms, and that the majority of RA absorbed was degraded into conjugated and/or methylated forms of CAA, FA and COA before being excreted gradually in the urine.",1
"Four commercial cereal products were examined and compared for their free radical scavenging properties, chelating capacity, and total phenolic contents. The Quaker Oat Bran™ ready-to-eat cold cereal showed the greatest activity to quench DPPH radicals, while the Quaker oatmeal had the highest capacity against ABTS+. Significant Fe2+ chelating activity was also detected in these cereal products with EDTA equivalents of 0.08 to 0.48 mg/g cereals. The total phenolic contents were 203 to 524 mg per gram of cereal products. These results indicate that readily available cereal products contain significant levels of antioxidants and may be an important source of dietary antioxidants.",1
"Since blinatumomab's approval as the first bispecific antibody (BsAb) in cancer therapy, these immunomodulatory agents have achieved substantial success in lymphoid malignancies. A decade after provisional approval in relapsed settings, blinatumomab became part of first-line induction therapy for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Now, six additional BsAbs have FDA approvals for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and multiple myeloma (MM), achieving high response rates in otherwise refractory scenarios. In lymphoma, epcoritamab, glofitamab, and mosunetuzumab show proof-of-principle for complete remission (CR) without chemotherapy or cell-based treatment. Single-agent remissions do not appear durable, but fortunately, these immunotherapies are readily combined with other treatment modalities. Therefore, their true potential to contribute to cures may be close on the horizon owing to ongoing and future trials. In MM, teclistamab, talquetamab, and elranatamab achieve impressive CR rates in the relapsed setting and similarly, are being investigated in earlier line combinations and in precursor entities such as smoldering myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). With a unique mechanism of action and continued testing in earlier lines, BsAbs are poised to be among the winners in the race to the frontline treatment of hematologic malignancies.",0
"Five green vegetables (qing‐gen‐cai, Chinese Cabbage, spinach, Welsh onion and green pepper) commonly used in our daily diet were analysed to determine their antioxidative and antimutagenic activities and chemical content of polyphenols. We obtained pesticide‐free and organically cultivated (O) vegetables using water‐soluble chitosan as a soil modifier and leaf surface spray (as an alternative natural insecticide) in order to investigate biofunctions induced or enhanced by such specialised cultivation practices. In addition, we purchased the same varieties of vegetables cultivated on an adjacent farm in the conventional manner (C) using pesticides and chemical fertilisers in order to examine the differences in biological activities and distribution of constituents responsible for such activities. The antioxidative activity shown by O vegetables was 120% times higher than that shown by C vegetables in the case of spinach and 20–50% higher in the case of Welsh onion, Chinese cabbage and qing‐gen‐cai. In comparison with C vegetables, the antimutagenic activity shown by O vegetables was higher against 4‐nitroquinoline oxide (4NQO) in qing‐gen‐cai, Chinese cabbage and Welsh onion, against benzo[ a ]pyrene (BaP) in all five vegetables, against 2‐amino‐3‐methylimidazo[4,5‐ f ]quinoline (IQ) in qing‐gen‐cai, Chinese cabbage and green pepper and against 3‐amino‐1‐methyl‐5 H ‐pyrido[4,3‐ b ]indole acetate (Trp‐P‐2) in spinach only. Among all green vegetable juices tested for flavonoid composition, quercitrin, caffeic acid and baicalein in O vegetables were detected in concentrations 1.3–10.4 times higher than those found in C vegetables, suggesting the influence of different cultivation practices.",1
"Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.",1
"BCL11B is a pan-T-cell transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in guiding T-cell differentiation and maturation. BCL11B is lineage specific, and its expression is confined to T cells; B, NK ​and myeloid cells are usually negative. In this study, we aim to explore the value of BCL11B in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of lymphomas/leukaemias exhibiting an ambiguous immunophenotype or which simultaneously express both T- and B-cell markers. The study cohort included 23 cases with a mixed/ambiguous immunophenotype, including five cases of T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) with B-marker expression, 10 mature T-cell lymphomas either with B-marker expression or lacking the expression of most T markers, three diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with T-marker expression, one classic Hodgkin lymphoma positive for T-cell antigens, and four plasma cell neoplasms expressing T markers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis for BCL11B was performed using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. All five cases of T-ALL were positive for BCL11B, confirming T-lineage. Amongst 10 cases of mature T-cell lymphoma, eight were BCL11 positive, and the remaining two BCL11B-negative cases were anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). All cases of B-cell lymphoma, classic Hodgkin lymphoma, ​and plasma cell neoplasm were negative for BCL11B, consistent with their non-T-lineage. In conclusion, BCL11B IHC is valuable in designating T-lineage in neoplasms with a mixed/ambiguous immunophenotype. As observed in this study, BCL11B expression is highly specific for T-cell lineage. Of note, the absence of BCL11B does not completely exclude a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma or leukaemia, especially in cases with a potential diagnosis of ALCL.",0
"The effects of the industrial juice process on the antioxidant capacities of cranberry samples and of three phenolic extracts (polar phenolics (E1), apolar phenolics (E2) and anthocyanins (E3)) adjusted at pH 2.5 and 7.0 were investigated. The free radical-scavenging (FRS) and the lipid peroxidation inhibition (LPI) activities of each sample and extract, were studied using a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine discoloration test and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, respectively. The FRS and the LPI results, expressed in mM Trolox® equivalent (TE)/mg phenol and mg TE/mL/mg phenol, respectively, showed a negative effect of the juice process steps on E1. The E2 and E3 extracts were also affected by the process but not as much. The milling step increased the FRS capacity of E2 and E3 extracts, but decreased their LPI capacity. The evaporation of the juice did not have a significant effect on the FRS capacity, but lowered the LPI capacity. Before and after each step of the juice process, the FRS capacity of the cranberry extracts was greater than the LPI capacity. The results were consistent in classifying the FRS capacity of the extracts in the following order of polarity: E1>E3>E2; and their total phenolic (TP) content in the following order: E3>E2>E1. In general, the neutralization of the pH of the extracts did not significantly influence the changes observed during the juice process in the FRS and LPI capacity, except for E3 for which a decrease in the LPI capacity was observed.",1

"The childhood patients with mixed-lineage leukemia rearrangement (MLL-r) gene have worse outcome than non-MLL, and thus often treated with high-risk chemotherapy regimens, so targeted therapy is important for this type of leukemia. This purpose of study was to explore the effects of ruxolitinib on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle of Nalm-6 cells. In this study, human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line Nalm-6 was used as the research object. By constructing an MLL overexpression vector to transfect Nalm-6 cells, exogenous JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway inhibitor ruxolitinib was applied to observe the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle changes of the transfected Nalm-6 cells. Western blot was performed to determine the proteins (MLL-BP, JAK, STAT) involved in the mechanism of action of MLL-r leukemia. CCK8 assay and flow cytometry (FCM) were used for testing the proliferation and apoptosis among MLL-BP transfected Nalm-6 cells. Firstly, we determine the IC50 of ruxolitinib on Nalm-6 cells. Secondly, FCM and CCK8 showed that ruxolitinib dosedependentlyinhibits proliferation of Nalm-6 cells by blocking the cell cycle at G These data provide compelling evidence that ruxolitinib is a promising agent against MLL-r leukemia cell line. However, it needs going through multiple more steps to confirm before it can be an option in clinical practice.",0
"Stilbenes, in particular trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, are widely reported to be beneficial to health, having been shown to possess antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and antitumor properties. Major dietary sources include grapes, wine, peanuts, and soy; however, they can also be introduced into the diet through Itadori tea, which has long been used in Japan and China as a traditional herbal remedy for heart disease and strokes. Analysis of grapes, peanuts, and Itadori tea shows that they contain mainly trans-resveratrol glucoside. In contrast, red wines are primarily a source of the aglycones cis- and trans-resveratrol. While peanuts and grapes contain low levels of the stilbenes, Itadori tea and red wine both supply relatively high concentrations of resveratrol. For people who do not consume alcohol, Itadori tea may be a suitable substitute for red wine. However, further study on the potential biological effects of other endogenous compounds in Itadori tea is required and there is also a need for more information on the absorption and in vivo biomedical actions of free and conjugated resveratrol.",1
"Proanthocyanidins, flavonoids exhibiting cardiovascular protection, constitute a major fraction of the flavonoid ingested in the human diet. Although they are poorly absorbed, they are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into various phenolic acids. An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive measurement of a large number of metabolites in a very short run time, which makes it ideal for use in epidemiological studies.",1
"The bean, an important component of the Mexican diet, provides 20 to 40% protein, B-complex vitamins, and minerals such as iron and calcium. Bean starch serves as a source of energy and carbon structures for later synthesis in metabolism; however, the presence of antinutritional factors such as trypsin inhibitors, phytic acid, oligosaccharides, and tannins reduces its biological value. The objective of this study was to characterize antinutritional factors and determine the biochemical components of the bean seed coat that can be used, in addition to fiber, as antioxidants, in a group of 16 improved bean varieties. The bean seeds with the highest percentage of seed coat were the black and bayo varieties, which had medium-sized (25 to 38 g per 100 seeds) and large (>40 g per 100 seeds) grains. The varieties contained 3.83 to 5.60% oligosaccharides in the cotyledon, with no statistical difference (p>0.05) among them. The percentage of phytic acid ranged from 0.10 to 0.22%, with the Mayocoba variety standing out for its high content (2.16±0.03 mg g-1). The trypsin inhibitor units (TIU mg-1) in flour extracts ranged from 4.78 to 12.22 TIU mg-1, with the highest value found in Flor de Mayo M38. The varieties with the greatest antioxidant capacity were associated with the darkest seed coat coloration.",1
"The aim of this data paper is to describe a collection of 33 genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing datasets of the B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line REH. REH is one of the most frequently used cell lines for functional studies of pediatric ALL, and these data provide a multi-faceted characterization of its molecular features. The datasets described herein, generated with short- and long-read sequencing technologies, can both provide insights into the complex aberrant karyotype of REH, and be used as reference datasets for sequencing data quality assessment or for methods development. This paper describes 33 datasets corresponding to 867 gigabases of raw sequencing data generated from the REH cell line. These datasets include five different approaches for whole genome sequencing (WGS) on four sequencing platforms, two RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques on two different sequencing platforms, DNA methylation sequencing, and single-cell ATAC-sequencing.",0
"Herein, a pH-responsive delivery system based on sodium alginate (ALG), ε-polylysine (PLL) and alliin (ALL) has been designed. The innovative use of the charged nature of alliin to prepare carriers loaded with kidney tea saponins has rarely been reported in the literature before. The size and morphology of the complex was quantified by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), exhibiting a size of 141 ± 1 nm. The carrier shows effective pH-responsiveness, stability in the gastric environment and dissociation in the intestinal environment. Kidney tea saponins can easily pass through the stomach directly into the intestine after encapsulation at pH = 1. Furthermore, in vitro simulated digestion was used to validate the efficacy of the delivery system. When kidney tea saponin was administered orally, it could reach the intestinal tract barely. However, when it was encapsulated in the carrier, approximately 60 % of the kidney tea saponin could be delivered to the intestinal tract. The strategy increases bioavailability of kidney tea saponins within the intestine successfully. The findings indicate that ALG-PLL-ALL may serve as a suitable delivery system for the intestinal targeted releasing of health factors that are susceptible to hydrolysis and unstable in the stomach.",0
"CD7 Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy demonstrates efficacy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)T-ALL/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL), but concerns about T-cell depletion and severe immunodeficiency persist. We compared infection rates and immune cell subsets in 60 R/R T-ALL/LBL patients receiving naturally selected CD7 CAR-T (NS7CAR-T) with 60 R/R B-ALL patients undergoing CD19 CAR-T. Infections were monitored from infusion until allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or up to 3 months. Overall infection rates did not significantly differ between groups (36.67% vs. 24.56%, p = 0.24), although the incidence of early immune effector cell-associated haematotoxicity (ICAHT) grade III-IV was higher in the CD7 CAR-T group than in the CD19 CAR-T group (33.9% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.03). Post-CD7 CAR-T infusion analysis showed a significant decline in CD7(+) T cells and an increase in non-CAR-T-derived CD7(-) T cells, particularly non-CAR-T cells, which rose to a median proportion of 84.4% (range: 22.1%-99.9%) by day 28; meanwhile, CD7(-) natural killer (NK) cells approached nearly 100% following the depletion of CD7(+) NK cells. This study indicates that while CD7 CAR-T therapy significantly reduces CD7(+) T cells, it does not lead to increased short-term infection rates. The notable expansion of non-CAR-T-derived CD7(-) T and NK cells helps preserve immune function, highlighting distinct therapeutic mechanisms between CD7 CAR-T and CD19 CAR-T due to their different lineage restrictions.",0
"With the significant advances in breast cancer treatment, the survival rates have improved. Consequently, improving the quality of life for breast cancer survivors has emerged an important issue. In this study, we examined the management of post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) in breast cancer patients thorough a comprehensive literature review. We introduce the preventive measures and pharmacotherapy for PMPS in breast cancer patients and discuss the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions. We conducted a literature search for relevant articles in Medline ALL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and nine other databases from October 2023 to January 2024. Chronic pain was defined as pain persisting for more than 3 months after breast cancer surgery. The search included terms related to PMPS, psychological interventions, and breast cancer. Data extraction was done independently by two reviewers, and any discrepancies will be discussed to ensure consensus or by a third reviewer. Studies have investigated surgical anesthetics, postoperative medications, and surgical procedures for PMPS prevention, but few have focused on treatment. Our literature search about the usefulness of psychosocial interventions yielded two articles, one was about the usefulness of mindfulness and the other was about the efficacy of yoga. Mindfulness and yoga show potential efficacy for PMPS treatment, but the evidence is limited. More research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore other psychosocial interventions.",0
"To investigate the cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIR) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after treatment with the Chinese Children's Cancer Group ALL-2015 (CCCG-ALL-2015) protocol and the risk factors for recurrence. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 852 children who were treated with the CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol from January 2015 to December 2019. CIR was calculated, and the risk factors for the recurrence of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) were analyzed. Among the 852 children with ALL, 146 (17.1%) experienced recurrence, with an 8-year CIR of 19.8%±1.6%. There was no significant difference in 8-year CIR between the B-ALL group and the acute T lymphocyte leukemia group ( There is still a relatively high recurrence rate in children with ALL after treatment with the CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol, mainly bone marrow recurrence alone in the very early stage and the early stage, and minimal residual disease≥0.01% on day 46 and positive",0
"A HPLC method was developed for the separation and determination of flavonoid and phenolic antioxidants in cranberry juices. Free flavonoid and phenolic compounds were fractionated into neutral and acidic groups by means of a solid-phase extraction method, followed by subsequent HPLC separations. Combined flavonoids and phenolics were hydrolyzed by acid before HPLC analysis. This developed method provides a fast and high resolution of individual flavonoid and phenolic compounds. In cranberry fruit, flavonoids and phenolic acids exist predominantly in combined forms, such as glycosides and esters. A total of 400 mg of total flavonoids and phenolic compounds/l of sample was found in a freshly squeezed cranberry juice, which was distributed as about 44% of phenolic acids and 56% of flavonoids. Benzoic acid was the major phenolic compound. Major flavonoids in the freshly squeezed cranberry juice were quercetin and myricetin.",1
"To investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of indirubin in treating ALL using network pharmacology and experimental validation. Potential targets of indirubin- and ALL-related genes were identified using public databases. Core genes were filtered through protein-protein interaction analysis in Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to explore the potential mechanisms of indirubin against ALL. Drug-disease-functional annotation-signaling pathway network maps were constructed. Molecular docking between indirubin and core proteins was performed using AutoDock Vina software. Finally, both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to validate these findings. PPI network analysis identified eight potential core targets of indirubin in ALL: AKT1, CASP3, and the mammalian target of rapamycin. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that the mechanism of action of indirubin against ALL involves multiple biological functions and signaling pathways, with the PI3K-AKT pathway likely playing a central role. Molecular docking findings further confirmed the strong binding affinity of indirubin for the core targets. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that indirubin inhibited ALL cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; the underlying mechanism may involve the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. The action and mechanism of indirubin in ALL through network pharmacology, as well as in vivo and in vitro experimental validation were elucidated, offering new insights and potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of ALL.",0
"(-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.",1
"Many children treated for ALL develop long-term neurocognitive impairments. Increased risk of these impairments is associated with treatment and demographic factors. Exposure to anesthesia is an additional possible risk factor. This study evaluated the impact of cumulative exposure to anesthesia on neurocognitive outcomes among a multicenter cohort of children with ALL. This study was embedded in AALL1131, a Children's Oncology Group phase III trial for patients with high-risk B-ALL. In consenting patients age 6-12 years, prospective uniform assessments of neurocognitive function were performed during and at 1 year after completion of therapy. Exposure to all episodes of anesthetic agents was abstracted. Multivariable linear regression models determined associations of cumulative anesthetic agents with the primary neurocognitive outcome reaction time/processing speed (age-normed) at 1 year off therapy, adjusting for baseline neurocognitive score, age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status (as a proxy for socioeconomic status), and leukemia risk group. One hundred and forty-four children, 76 (52.8%) males, mean age of 9.1 (min-max, 6.0-12.0) years at diagnosis, underwent a median of 27 anesthetic episodes (min-max, 1-37). Almost all patients were exposed to propofol (140/144, 97.2%), with a mean cumulative dose of 112.3 mg/kg. One year after therapy, the proportion of children with impairment ( In a multicenter and uniformly treated cohort of children with B-ALL, cumulative exposure to propofol was an independent risk factor for impairment in reaction time/processing speed 1 year after therapy. Anesthesia exposure is a modifiable risk, and opportunities to minimize propofol use should be considered.",0
"The polyphenolics of raisins were extracted, separated by HPLC, and characterized by their UV-vis spectra, and their concentrations measured. Color measurements and browning indices were also determined. Samples (n = 20) included sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins. Comparisons were also made with fresh and frozen Thompson Seedless grapes. Golden raisins (which are treated with SO(2)) had the highest amount of hydroxycinnamic acids and the highest lightness values. In comparison with fresh grapes, percent losses of the two major hydroxycinnamics (caftaric and coutaric acids) in sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins were on the order of 90%. Flavonols were not influenced by processing as much as hydroxycinnamics, while procyanidins and flavan-3-ols were completely degraded in all raisin samples. Formation of hydroxymethylfurfural and loss of amino acids in sun-dried and dipped raisins are ascribed to Maillard browning reactions.",1
"The amounts of flavonols (quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol) and phenolic acids (ellagic, p-coumaric, caffeic and ferulic acids) were analysed in six strawberry cultivars and in the berries of genus Vaccinium (four blueberry cultivars, wild bilberry, wild bog whortleberry). Differences between strawberries from organic vs. conventional cultivation were investigated and the influence of geographical origin on phenolic compounds of strawberries and blueberries was studied. Three different extraction and hydrolysis procedures together with two HPLC methods with diode-array UV/vis detection were used. The varietal differences in the total content of the phenolics analysed were larger among the cultivated blueberries (from 4.4 to 9.2 mg/100 g, fresh weight) than among the strawberry cultivars (from 42.1 to 54.4 mg/100 g). Some regional differences were observed in the phenolic contents in blueberries and strawberries. Compared to conventional cultivation techniques, organic cultivation had no consistent effect on the levels of phenolic compounds in strawberries.",1
"Paediatric-inspired acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) regimens have led to improved leukaemic outcomes in adults. However, avascular necrosis (AVN) has emerged as a debilitating orthopaedic complication. AVN is likely multifactorial, with corticosteroids and asparaginase therapy playing key roles in its pathogenesis. We assessed the incidence and potential risk factors for AVN, in older adolescent and adult patients with ALL treated with the FRALLE-93 protocol across three Australian tertiary centres. AVN occurred in 24% of 59 patients, primarily affecting hip and knee joints. Diagnosis occurred at a median of 11.7 months from commencement of chemotherapy. No association was identified between AVN risk and sex, age, BMI, smoking status and vitamin D level. The majority of patients required orthopaedic intervention (64%). Approximately two thirds had chronic pain or impaired mobility. AVN risk in adult patients with ALL receiving FRALLE protocols appears at least comparable to rates reported in paediatric cohorts.",0
"This study sought to evaluate the effect of steam cooking on the vitamin C, total phenolics, total flavonoid and antioxidant properties (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH] free radical and 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonate) [ABTS*] radical scavenging abilities, reducing property and Fe2+ chelating ability) of some tropical green leafy vegetables: Talinum triangulare, Ocimum gratissimum, Amaranthus hybridus, Telfairia occidentalis, Ipomea batata, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Baselia alba and Senecio biafrae leaves. The results of the study revealed that cooking causes a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the vitamin C (raw [321.4–842.0], cooked [198.2–638.4 mg/100 g]) content. Conversely, there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the total phenol (raw [146.9–693.8], cooked [272.9–1037.5 mg/100 g]), total flavonoid (raw [8.2–53.0], cooked [12.9–57.4 mg/100 g]), DPPH radical scavenging ability (raw [15.7–61.8], cooked [52.8–92.7%]), reducing property (raw: 28.3–61.8; cooked: 43.9–71.6 mg/100 g ascorbic acid equivalent [AAE]), Fe2+ chelating ability (raw [17.4–75.4], cooked [22.8–89.2%]) and ABTS* scavenging ability (raw [17.4–87.3], cooked [57.5–113.2 mmol/100 g trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]). In view of this, it could be concluded that steam cooking decreases the vitamin C content of all the vegetables, while it increased the phenolic content and antioxidant activities.",1
"The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer subunit composition and mDP.",1
"Ultra-high pressure homogenization (UHPH) at 300MPa and 4°C inlet temperature were used to preserve apple juice, and shelf-life evaluation of aseptically packaged juice was investigated. After processing Tetra Brik containers were stored at temperatures of 4, 10, 20 and 30°C during 60days. In this article, the effect of processing on the spoilage inactivation was evaluated after processing and during the storage trial. Non-germinated and germinated spores were found in the UHPH-treated juice, being an inactive population during storage. Patulin content was also not modified by UHPH processing, but a significant decrease was observed during storage at 30°C (P<0.05). Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and pectinmethylesterase (PME) activity was not found after UHPH-processing and during storage. A kinetic study of post-processing quality loss was conducted. Vitamin C, chlorogenic acid, total polyphenols and color change were measured during storage study and were used to model the UHPH-treated apple juice shelf-life. Loss of vitamin C was correlated with the hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) accumulation (0.59, P<0.05). A limiting quality parameter was polyphenolic content. UHPH-treated apple juice stored at 4°C was found to show a shelf-life for about 21months by preserving the color characteristics of the juice with low HMF accumulation. From 15°C changes in quality parameters were more evident.",1
"This study examined the application of pressurized low polarity water (PLPW) extraction of lignans, proteins and carbohydrates from defatted flaxseed meal. Key processing conditions included temperature (130, 160, 190°C), solvent pH (4, 6.5 and 9), solvent to solid ratio (90, 150 and 210mL/g) and introduction of co-packing material (0 and 3g glass beads). The addition of 3g glass beads increased the yields for all target compounds. The maximum yield of lignans (21mg/g meal) was obtained at 170°C with solvent to solid ratio of 100mL/g meal at pH 9. Optimal conditions for protein extraction were pH 9, solvent to solid ratio of 210mL/g meal and 160°C. Total carbohydrates recovery was maximized at 215mg/g meal (50% recovery) at pH 4 and 150°C with solvent to solid ratio of 210mL/g meal. The increase of temperature accelerated extraction, thus reducing solvent volume and time to reach equilibrium. For the extraction of proteins and carbohydrates, however, a temperature of 130–160°C is recommended, as proteins and carbohydrates are vulnerable to thermal degradation.",1
"Levels of total phenol, catechins, and caffeine in teas commonly consumed in the United Kingdom have been determined using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect in various population groups.",1
"High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection was used to study phenolic compounds in berries of black, green, red, and white currants (Ribes spp.). UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for the first time.",1
"This study aims to elucidate the significance of HOX11 gene expression in acute leukemia, offering insights for readers unfamiliar with this gene's role. We utilized qRT-PCR to examine HOX11 expression in 76 patients, categorizing them into high and low expression groups based on specific thresholds established for this study. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed at the time of diagnosis and on day 28, associated with the analysis of the correlation of HOX11 gene expression with clinical outcomes and prognosis. On days 0 and 28, the median HOX11 gene expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was 16.2 and 4.43, respectively, which was 9.67 and 2.37 in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), respectively. Enrolled patients were further divided into high genome and low expression groups based on the expression of HOX11. The median HOX11 gene expression on days 0 and 28 in nonresponders to therapy was significantly higher than that in responders to therapy. In addition, baseline HOX11 gene expression was significantly lower in patients with complete remission than in patients with recurrence. The high expression of the HOX11 gene was associated with shorter overall survival time and disease-free survival time. Our findings reveal significant differences in HOX11 expression between patient groups and across time points, suggesting implications for patient prognosis. The results consistently highlight statistically significant differences, enhancing the study's validity. The study suggests the potential of using HOX11 expression as a marker in clinical practice for monitoring acute leukemia prognosis.",0
"The number of sacrocolpopexies performed with transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) is increasing, and presacral fixation is the most dangerous step. Therefore, the training opportunities for trainees to become competent in performing vNOTES sacrocolpopexy are very important. Simulation-based training is ideal for filling this gap. The objective of this video article is to demonstrate a simulation surgical training model in vNOTES presacral fixation. The Department of Gynecology at a university hospital. A urogynecological surgeon. (1) Establish presacral model (Fig. 1) and pelvic model (Fig. 2). (2) Establish vNOTES single-port platform. (3) Steps of vNOTES presacral fixation: (a) Identify the sacral promontory and right hypogastric nerve (rHN), and incise the right pelvic peritoneum. (b) Expose and open the presacral fascia to expose the middle sacral vessels and anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL). (c) Complete mesh fixation. (d) Close the pelvic peritoneum. This study is exempt from IRB approval. Model materials and corresponding costs are given in Table 1. We present a presacral fixation simulation model during vNOTES sacrocolpopexy. A piece of rubber tissue is attached to pelvic model to accurately simulate the vagina, thus achieving the establishment of the vNOTES single-port platform. The presacral model displays the anatomic hierarchy of presacral exposure: pelvic peritoneum, presacral fascia, presacral space, as well as the ALL, rHN, ureter, and presacral vessels, which are embedded in these layers. Presacral slope design enables realistic presacral suture and mesh fixation. In case of nerve, blood vessel, or ureteral injury during dissection, this model simulates the manifestation through the leakage of different colored liquids. This new model allows the next generation of urogynecological surgeons to acquire adequate training to make them more prepared to perform their initial vNOTES sacrocolpopexy on a patient, possibly increasing future safety and effectiveness.",0
"In 1997 and 1998 the effect of six different organic treatments on the chemical, rheological and sensory quality of cooked potatoes was investigated. Cattle slurry and cattle deep litter were each applied to sandy soil in three ways. The type of manure applied gave the most distinct effect on sensory quality. Manuring with slurry decreased dry matter, starch and phytic acid and increased N and rheological properties (modulus of deformability, stress, strain) significantly compared with deep litter manuring. Maturity of tubers was assumed to be the main cause of these differences. Regarding the sensory quality of potatoes, minor differences were found among the organic treatments investigated. Potatoes manured with slurry were slightly moister and seemed to have higher discolouration and off-odour and lower yellowness than potatoes manured with deep litter. Mealiness was highest when composted deep litter was ploughed in and lowest when deep litter and straw were ploughed in. The observed differences in sensory quality are presumably an effect of availability of N in the manure. Chlorogenic acid was the only phenolic acid that was affected by the organic treatments. The variation in phenolic acid and scopoletin contents did not seem to influence the off-taste of potatoes. As the sensory quality of potatoes produced by different organic treatments had not been addressed previously, this study revealed interesting results.",1
"In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.",1
"The high cost of blinatumomab in full doses of full treatments has led to dose reduction and fewer treatment cycles for most patients in China. With current needs for cost-efficiency and resource management in health care, we retrospectively evaluated the clinical effects of short-course blinatumomab treatment for R/R Ph- B-ALL at our center. Blinatumomab was administered with 24-h continuous intravenous infusion (9 μg/day for the first 3 days and 28 μg/day for 6-10 days). The clinical data of 30 R/R B-ALL patients were collected and analyzed. A total of 25 patients (83.3%) including 13 (43.3%) with a high leukemic load (> 50%) achieved morphological CR. Twelve patients (40%) were MRD-negative. The estimated 2-year OS rate was 82.62%. The 2-year PFS rate was 78.35%. The estimated 2-year OS and PFS were significantly better in patients receiving further treatment. Our findings provide novel insights into the optimization of blinatumomab therapy, proposing a viable treatment alternative that aligns with current needs for cost-efficiency and resource management in health care.",0
"Eight varieties of Cichorium genus vegetables (five heavily red colored, one red spotted, and two fully green) were investigated for their phenolic content (by HPLC and UV-vis spectrophotometry) and for their antioxidant activity. In particular, the capacity (that is, the amount of trapped peroxyl radicals) and the efficiency (that is, the amount of antioxidant necessary to halve the steady-state concentration of peroxyl radicals) were measured. All of the studied chicories are characterized by the presence of a large amount of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, whereas the red color is due to cyanidin glycosides. The presence of these phenolics in red chicories confers to them an exceptionally high peroxyl radical scavenging activity in terms of both capacity and efficiency, particularly in their early stage of growth, and makes this popular and low-cost foods comparable or superior to many foods having well-known antioxidant properties such as red wine, blueberry, and tomato.",1
"Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy for relapsed/refractory (r/r) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) patients has shown promising effects, but side effects such as viral infections have been observed. A total of 45 patients with r/r B-ALL and r/r B-NHL were included in this retrospective study. Patient demographics were recorded, with the primary endpoint being viral infection within 3 months post CAR-T treatment. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis were used to analyze independent factors. The patients were divided into a training cohort of 28 and a validation cohort of 17 to construct a prediction model based on determined independent factors. The model's discrimination and calibration were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA curve). The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of the 43 patients showed that low baseline lymphocyte ratio was an independent risk factor and using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) early was a protective factor for viral infection after CAR-T therapy in patients with B-ALL and B-NHL. Based on that, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the training cohort and validation cohort was 0.935 (95% CI 0.837-1.000) and 0.869 (95%CI 0.696-1.000), respectively, showing excellent predictive value. We established a nomogram to predict the factors' influence on viral infection after CAR-T therapy and found that the ratio of baseline lymphocytes and using G-CSF early or lately were able to predict viral infection after CAR-T therapy in r/r B-ALL and B-NHL.",0
"Children are surviving cancer in greater numbers than ever. Over the last 50 years, substantial advancements in pediatric cancer treatment have resulted in an 85% 5-year survival rate. Nonetheless, a notable 10%-15% of patients encounter relapse or develop refractory disease, leading to significantly lower survival. Recent attempts to further intensify cytotoxic chemotherapy have failed due to either severe toxicities or ineffectiveness, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. Immunotherapies are emerging and expanding their clinical application to a wide array of cancers, including those affecting children. In pediatric cancers, monoclonal antibodies targeting GD2 have demonstrated durable radiographic and histologic responses in neuroblastoma (NB), and CD19-targeted bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have likewise changed the outlook for refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. This review discusses the clinical development of immunotherapies for pediatric cancers, focusing on pediatric ALL and NB, two major pediatric cancers transformed by immunotherapy, updates on the recent advancements in immunotherapies, and further discusses the future directions of immunotherapy for pediatric cancers.",0
"A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature. The HPLC procedure is considerably faster than the TLC procedure with equal or superior precision and accuracy.",1
"Hematologic toxicity (HT) is a joint adverse event after CAR-T cells infusion. Some patients experience prolonged hematologic toxicity (PHT), which is challenging to treat. We collected clinical data from patients with relapsed refractory B-ALL treated with CD19 CAR-T cells. Patients with PHT who did not respond to erythropoietin, platelet receptor agonists, transfusion, or G-CSF and eventually received low-dose prednisone therapy were included in the analysis. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of low-dose prednisone on PHT. Among 109 patients treated with CD19 CAR-T cells, 78.9% (86/109) of patients were evaluated as PHT. Of these, 15 patients had persistent hematological toxicity after infusion (12 were grade 3/4 cytopenia, 12 were trilineage cytopenia and 3 were bilineage cytopenia), 2 developed cytopenia without apparent cause after D28. The initial prednisone dose was 0.5 mg/kg/day, and the median response time was 21 days (7-40 days). The recovery rate of blood count was 100%, and the complete recovery rate ranged from 60% to 66.67%. Especially exciting was that HT recurred in 6 patients after stopping prednisone. They were relieved again after the administration of prednisone. The median follow-up time was 14.97 months (4.1-31.2 months). Twelve-month duration of PFS and OS rates were 58.8% (±11.9%) and 64.7% (±11.6%). We did not observe any other side effects of prednisone apart from drug-controllable hyperglycemia and hypertension. We suggest that low-dose prednisone is a beneficial and tolerable therapy for PHT after CAR-T cells. The trials have been registered at www.chictr.org.cn as ChiCTR-ONN-16009862 (November 14, 2016) and ChiCTR1800015164 (March 11, 2018).",0
"VHL germline mutations are classically associated with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, but their role in hematological malignancies remains underexplored. We analyzed a pedigree with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) proband and two offspring: primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) via targeted sequencing and familial validation. Genetic analysis revealed: (1) the proband carried concurrent VHL, ASXL3, and CCR7 germline mutations along with acquired BCOR/NF1 variants; (2) the ITP-affected offspring inherited ASXL3/CCR7 mutations only; and (3) the T-ALL case exhibited solely the VHL mutation. Acquired mutations (e.g., BCOR/NF1) in the proband suggest a 'two-hit' model for leukemogenesis. This study identifies VHL as the principal predisposing mutation in a familial hematologic malignancy pedigree presenting with heterogeneous phenotypes, where ASXL3/CCR7 variants may serve as phenotypic modifiers. These findings advocate for genotype-driven surveillance strategies in familial hematological disorders.",0
"Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of sleep disturbances, an often, neglected aspect of holistic health. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of sleep disturbances in survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to identify any risk factors for the same. Survivors of ALL aged 6-18 years, who had completed their treatment, at least two or more years ago, were enrolled. The Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) was used to assess the sleep problems. Out of 89 childhood survivors of ALL, 42.7% had sleep disturbances. Fears during treatment, painful memories during treatment, younger age at enrolment, and shorter interval from treatment completion were significantly more in patients having sleep problems. Approximately half of childhood ALL survivors had sleep problems. Fears during chemotherapy and shorter post-completion interval were significant risk factors for sleep problems in childhood cancer survivors.",0
"Oct3/4 is a transcription factor that maintains the stemness of both embryonic and adult stem cells. The Oct3/4 gene produces three isoforms: namely, Oct3/4A, Oct3/4B and Oct3/4B1. Increased Oct3/4 expression is associated with lower survival rates and chemoresistance in patients with cancer. The present study examined the association between Oct3/4 isoforms expression and the risk of relapse to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The mRNA expression levels of Oct3/4A, Oct3/4B and Oct3/4B1 were analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR in 51 patients with ALL and 12 children without ALL. The results of the present study indicated that the mRNA expression levels of Oct3/4A (P=0.008), Oct3/4B (P=0.019) and Oct3/4B1 (P=0.025) were significantly elevated in patients with ALL. Moreover, elevated mRNA expression levels of Oct3/4A [odds ratio (OR)=13.33; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.57-112.99; P=0.018), Oct3/4B (OR=20.00; 95% CI: 2.37-168.64; P=0.006) and Oct3/4B1 (OR=7.26, 95% CI: 1.43-36.93; P=0.017) isoforms were associated with a heightened risk of relapse in patients with ALL. The multivariate analysis, stratified using established prognostic factors, identified Oct3/4A, Oct3/4B and Oct3/4B1 mRNA expression levels as independent prognostic markers of ALL. The results of the present study also indicated that the expression levels of Oct3/4A (P=0.0112), Oct3/4B (P=0.0044) and Oct3/4B1 (P=0.0071) were significantly elevated in CD34",0
"Reduced lipoprotein oxidizability by red wine phenols has been proposed as the basis for a relatively lower incidence of coronary heart disease in red wine drinkers.

"Disease and therapy-related hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia is a significant barrier to managing acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. To reduce the risk of haemorrhage, apheretic platelet transfusion is a modern, effective, and expensive option. Since most ALL patients in Bangladesh have financial constraints, this study can shed light on the magnitude of benefit regarding the effectiveness of apheretic platelet prophylactically and therapeutically in children of ALL receiving induction chemotherapy. This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the department of transfusion medicine and the department of paediatric haematology and oncology at a tertiary level hospital in Bangladesh from June 2020 to June 2021. A total of 33 cases of ALL were enroled in this study according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After receiving written informed consent, relevant data were collected using a face-to-face interview with the guardian of the patients, thorough clinical examination, and relevant investigation. After the collection of all the required data, analysis was done by Stata (v.16). Mean age of the patients was 7.39±4.46 (SD), ranging from 1 to 18 years. The majority of children were aged younger than or equal to 10 years (69.70%). Male children were slightly predominant (51.5%). Significant post-transfusion platelet increment (Median pre-transfusion count 16×10 Significant improvement in bleeding status and platelet count was observed following apheretic platelet transfusion.",0
"The phenolic antioxidant phytochemicals in wines have been implicated for the lower rates of cardiac disease mortality among people drinking wine regularly in certain European populations. The activities of 20 selected California wines in inhibiting the copper-catalyzed oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were determined. This antioxidant activity was related to the major phenolic compounds and not to resveratrol analyzed in wines by HPLC and GC-MS. The relative inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 46 to 100% with the red wines and from 3 to 6% with the white wines. When compared at the same total phenol concentration, the inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 37 to 65% with the red wines and from 27 to 46% with the white wines. The relative antioxidant activity correlated with total phenol contents of wines (r = 0.94) and with the concentrations of gallic acid (r = 0.92), catechin (r = 0.76), myricetin (r = 0.70), quercetin (r = 0.68), caffeic acid (r = 0.63), rutin (r = 0.50), epicatechin (r = 0.45), cyanidin (r = 0.43), and malvidin 3-glucoside (r = 0.38). Therefore, the activity of wines to protect LDL from oxidation appeared to be distributed widely among the principal phenolic compounds.",1
"High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is essential in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but its pharmacokinetics and toxicity are influenced by transporter and metabolic enzyme gene polymorphisms. This study examines the impact of gene polymorphisms in the MTX metabolic pathway on toxicity and pharmacokinetics in Chinese patients with ALL to aid individualized therapy in order to ensure the safety of patients. We prospectively collected 273 serum MTX concentration data from 92 patients with ALL (15-71 years) undergoing HD-MTX. Differences in liver and kidney toxicity markers were analyzed across gene polymorphisms. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effect modeling to explore the impact of demographic, biochemical, and genetic covariates. Patients who were homozygous for γ-glutamyl hydrolase gene rs13248452 (GG + AA genotypes) had higher urea levels. SLCO1B1 mutant allele carriers had elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with homozygous patients. SLC19A1 rs2838957 CT genotype patients had significantly higher aspartate aminotransferase. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the glomerular filtration rate significantly affected the MTX clearance, whereas gene polymorphisms did not significantly alter the clearance rate or volume of distribution of MTX. In conclusion, gene polymorphisms in SLCO1B1, SLC19A1, and γ-glutamyl hydrolase correlate with MTX-induced alterations in liver and kidney function indicators, but the toxicity mechanisms may be independent of systemic pharmacokinetics. In clinical practice, dosage adjustments should be made based on glomerular filtration rate, with enhanced monitoring for high-risk genotypes. Genetic markers should be combined with renal function monitoring to optimize individualized MTX therapy and improve safety. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study identifies γ-glutamyl hydrolase/SLCO1B1/SLC19A1 polymorphisms as key predictors of methotrexate toxicity in Chinese acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, whereas population pharmacokinetic reveals glomerular filtration rate-not genetics-drives clearance. Findings advocate for genotype-toxicity monitoring and glomerular filtration rate-based dosing to improve safety.",0

"The Wnt/β-catenin pathway's significance in cancer initiation, progression, and stem cell biology underscores its therapeutic potential. However, the clinical application of Wnt inhibitors remains limited due to challenges posed by off-target effects and complex cross-talk of Wnt signaling with other pathways. In this study, we leveraged a zebrafish model to perform a robust and rapid drug screening of 773 FDA-approved compounds to identify Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors with minimal toxicity. Utilizing zebrafish expressing a Wnt reporter, we identified several drugs that suppressed Wnt signaling without compromising zebrafish development. The efficacy of the top hit, Erlotinib, extended to human cells, where it blocked Wnt/β-catenin signaling downstream of the destruction complex. Notably, Erlotinib treatment reduced self-renewal in human T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells, which rely on active β-catenin signaling for maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells. Erlotinib also reduced leukemia-initiating cell frequency and delayed disease formation in zebrafish models. This study underscores zebrafish's translational potential in drug discovery and repurposing and highlights a new use for Erlotinib as a Wnt inhibitor for cancers driven by aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",0
"The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher (p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions (1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was >80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.",1
"Relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) is a challenging disease with low rates of remission and survival in adult patients. Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-Ts) therapies have been approved for these patients. Dual-target CAR-Ts against CD19 and CD22 have recently been developed to improve the efficacy of the single-target therapy; however, extent of the improvement using this dual-target therapy has yet to be determined. We performed a meta-analysis of the outcome and safety of CAR-Ts, comparing anti-CD19 vs anti-CD22 vs dual-target anti-CD19/CD22 CAR-Ts, to elucidate the differences and limitations of these therapies in adult patients with R/R B-ALL.",0
"Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) arising from drug interactions can carry life-threatening implications and result in lasting effects. SCARs can be triggered by various factors, with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole identified as a primary culprit. Anticonvulsants and antineoplastic agents have been noted as secondary triggers. Notably, antineoplastics linked to SCARs include immunomodulatory agents. The higher mortality rates among cancer patients with SCARs underscore the significance of comprehending cancer--specific risk factors. Our objective is to present the case of a boy with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) following MTX treatment. We present the case of a three-year-old male patient diagnosed with ALL who developed Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) subsequent to the administration of MTX, following the ""BFM 2009"" protocol. He had undergone intrathecal MTX administration on six previous occasions. Our patient received IVIG at a dose of 2g/kg along with steroids, resulting in partial clinical improvement after 21 days. An innovative protocol was developed, involving IVIG before MTX infusion and dexamethasone before MTXi, with folinic acid rescue. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) mitigates SJS/TEN via type IV hypersensitivity down-regulation and apoptosis curbing. As far as we know, the prophylactic use of IVIG to counteract SCARs in a pediatric leukemia patient represents uncharted territory. Moreover, research into the immune system dynamics within these patients and the preservation of indispensable treatments should involve allergist-immunologists as part of the multidisciplinary team attending to neoplastic conditions.",0
"Although it is well-known in transplant recipients, BK virus (BKV)-related haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) is an unexpected complication in children with leukaemia on standard chemotherapy. This retrospective observational study reported non-transplanted children who experienced BKV-related HC during acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukaemia treatment. Disease status, HC grade, BKV copy number in urine, blood counts, imaging findings, HC treatments and preceding oral mucositis and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) were evaluated. Twenty-three children with leukaemia were tested in urine BKV polymerase chain reaction for haematuria aetiology, and BKV was detected in 14 (60.9%). Seven of the patients (50%) had T cell ALL, 10 were 10 years old and older (71.4%) and 11 were male (78.6%). All patients were in the consolidation phase of therapy, and except one, all were in remission during HC. The mean BKV copy number in the urine was 0.443 × 10 BKV-related HC is a potential complication of patients with leukaemia during the consolidation phase of treatment. The risk factors of BKV-related HC in children with leukaemia are similar to those of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients.",0

"Efforts to cure BCR::ABL1 B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) solely through inhibition of ABL1 kinase activity have thus far been insufficient despite the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with broad activity against resistance mutants. The mechanisms that drive persistence within minimal residual disease (MRD) remain poorly understood and therefore untargeted. Utilizing 13 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and clinical trial specimens of Ph+ ALL, we examined how genetic and transcriptional features co-evolve to drive progression during prolonged TKI response. Our work reveals a landscape of cooperative mutational and transcriptional escape mechanisms that differ from those causing resistance to first generation TKIs. By analyzing MRD during remission, we show that the same resistance mutation can either increase or decrease cellular fitness depending on transcriptional state. We further demonstrate that directly targeting transcriptional state-associated vulnerabilities at MRD can overcome BCR::ABL1 independence, suggesting a new paradigm for rationally eradicating MRD prior to relapse. Finally, we illustrate how cell mass measurements of leukemia cells can be used to rapidly monitor dominant transcriptional features of Ph+ ALL to help rationally guide therapeutic selection from low-input samples.",0
"The levels of total polyphenols and o-diphenols were determined in virgin oils and in chloroform/methanol-extracted oils. The solventextracted oils were richer in polyphenols than the virgin oils. High polyphenol content was associated with a high resistance to oxidation of the oils. A linear relationship was found between polyphenol content and the oxidative stability of the virgin oils during storage at 60 C. After removal of the polyphenols, the oxidative stability of the oils decreased considerably and seemed to depend on polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration.",1
"This meta-analysis investigates the association between acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility and IKZF1 gene SNPs. Utilizing EMBASE, PubMed, and other databases, the study evaluated methodological quality through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) scoring and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) value. The present meta-analysis used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Review Manager 5.4 software was employed for data analysis, emphasizing genetic variants' significance (p < 0.05). Visualizations were achieved using funnel and Circos plots. A significant association was found between rs4132601 and ALL across genetic models, contrasting with the non-significant correlation for rs11978267. The findings underscore the complex interplay of genetic factors in ALL susceptibility, particularly related to IKZF1 SNPs. Ethnicity emphasizes the importance of diverse population considerations. This meta-analysis highlights the significance of rs4132601 in ALL's genetic foundation, suggesting potential advancements in diagnostics. The lack of correlation for rs11978267 highlights the complexity of its genetic association. Future studies should prioritize larger, diverse samples for a comprehensive understanding and improved strategies for ALL diagnoses and treatments.",0
"Physicochemical and sensory fruit characteristics were studied to assess the effects of cool storage on quality attributes of sweet cherries of the Sciazza variety, widespread in the Campania region and Ferrovia variety, marketed in Italy and abroad. The major sugar and organic acid constituents, anthocyanin composition, colour (CIE L*, a*, b*), firmness, volatile neo-formation compounds (acetaldehyde, ethanol and methanol) and sensory attributes were determined at harvest and after 15 days of fruit storage at 1 °C and 95% RH. The ANOVA and PCA plots showed that both cherry varieties and storage conditions affected sensory/chemical quality but the variation caused by cool storage seemed to be dependent on the varieties under study: Ferrovia cherries apparently varied less than Sciazza. The total anthocyanin and its qualitative composition were confirmed to be distinctive of the cherry varieties and important indicators of cool storage.",1
"Phenolic compounds in foods have been associated with reduced incidences of heart disease by acting as antioxidants for low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Commercial prune and prune juice extracts (Prunus domestica cv. French) were analyzed for phenolics by reversed phase HPLC with diode array detection and tested for the ability to inhibit the Cu2+-catalyzed oxidation of human LDL. The mean concentrations of phenolics were 1840 mg/kg, 1397 mg/kg, and 441 mg/L in pitted prunes, extra large prunes with pits, and prune juice, respectively. Hydroxycinnamates, especially neochlorogenic acid, and chlorogenic acid predominated, and these compounds, as well as the prune and prune juice extracts, inhibited the oxidation of LDL. The pitted prune extract inhibited LDL oxidation by 24, 82, and 98% at 5, 10, and 20 μM gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The prune juice extract inhibited LDL oxidation by 3, 62, and 97% at 5, 10, and 20 μM GAE. These data indicate that prunes and prune juice may provide a source of dietary antioxidants.",1
"Little is known about the transition mechanisms that govern early lymphoid lineage progenitors from common lymphoid progenitors (CLP). Pellino2 (PELI2) is a newly discovered E3 ubiquitin ligase, which plays important roles in inflammation and the immune system. However, the physiological and molecular roles of PELI2 in the differentiation of immune cells are largely unknown. Here, by using a conditional knockout mouse model, we demonstrated that PELI2 is required for early B-cell development and stressed hematopoiesis. PELI2 interacted with and stabilized PU.1 via K63-polyubiquitination to regulate IL-7R expression. The defects of B-cell development induced by PELI2 deletion were restored by overexpression of PU.1. Similarly, PELI2 promoted TCF3 protein stability via K63-polyubiquitination to regulate IL-7R expression, which is required for the proliferation of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells. These results underscore the significance of PELI2 in both normal B lymphopoiesis and malignant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia via the regulation of IL-7R expression, providing a potential therapeutic approach for BCP-ALL.",0
The most frequent chromosomal rearrangement in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22). It results in the fusion of the,0
"Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables containing high levels of phytochemicals has been recommended to prevent chronic diseases related to oxidative stress in the human body. In this study, 10 common vegetables were selected on the basis of consumption per capita data in the United States. A more complete profile of phenolic distributions, including both free and bound phenolics in these vegetables, is reported here using new and modified methods. Broccoli possessed the highest total phenolic content, followed by spinach, yellow onion, red pepper, carrot, cabbage, potato, lettuce, celery, and cucumber. Red pepper had the highest total antioxidant activity, followed by broccoli, carrot, spinach, cabbage, yellow onion, celery, potato, lettuce, and cucumber. The phenolics antioxidant index (PAI) was proposed to evaluate the quality/quantity of phenolic contents in these vegetables and was calculated from the corrected total antioxidant activities by eliminating vitamin C contributions. Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human liver cancer cells. Spinach showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by cabbage, red pepper, onion, and broccoli. On the basis of these results, the bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a simple reference for consumers to choose vegetables in accordance with their beneficial activities. The BI could be a new alternative biomarker for future epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.",1
"From the edible parts of the Spanish red onion (cultivar ‘Morada de Amposta’), the anthocyanins cyanidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-arabinoside, cyanidin 3-malonyl-glucoside and cyanidin 3-malonylarabinoside and the flavonoids quercetin 3,4′-diglucoside, quercetin 7,4′-diglucoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, dihydro-quercetin 3-glucoside and isorhamnetin 4′-glucoside were identified. The amount of anthocyanins reached 233 mg kg−1 and that of the flavonoids 943 mg kg−1 fresh weight of onions. The onions were processed minimally to produce fresh ‘ready-to-eat’ shredded onion, and the stability of the anthocyanin pigments was evaluated during storage in perforated films for 7 days at 8 °C. After 1 day of storage, a slight increase in anthocyanins was observed, followed by a decrease, reaching the lower levels after 7 days of storage. In spite of the decrease in anthocyanins, the appearance of the commodity was acceptable after the storage period. The stability of the individual anthocyanins was very different, the malonated anthocyanins being much more stable than the corresponding non-acylated pigments. In addition, the arabinosides were shown to be less stable than the corresponding glucosides.",1
"Leukemia is the most common cancer in children in industrialized countries, and its initiation often occurs prenatally. Folic acid is a key vitamin in the production and modification of DNA, and prenatal folic acid intake is known to reduce the risk of childhood leukemia. We characterized the one-carbon (folate) metabolism nutrients that may influence risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among 122 cases diagnosed at age 0-14 years during 1988-2011 and 122 controls matched on sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) applied to neonatal dried blood spots, we evaluated 11 folate pathway metabolites, overall and by sex, race/ethnicity, and age at diagnosis. To conduct the prediction analyses, the 244 samples were separated into learning (75%) and test (25%) sets, maintaining the matched pairings. The learning set was used to train classification methods which were evaluated on the test set. High classification error rates indicate that the folate pathway metabolites measured have little predictive capacity for pediatric ALL. In conclusion, the one-carbon metabolism nutrients measured at birth were unable to predict subsequent leukemia in children. These negative findings are reflective of the last weeks of pregnancy and our study does not address the impact of these nutrients at the time of conception or during the first trimester of pregnancy that are critical for the embryo's DNA methylation programming.",0
"Extracts of polyphenolic compounds were obtained from seeds of faba bean, broad bean, adzuki bean, red bean, pea, red lentil and green lentil using 80% (v/v) acetone. The total antioxidant activity (TAA) of extracts was determined and their astringency (Sensation Astringency Indices – SAI) investigated using the sensory scaling method. The content of tannins in extracts was expressed as absorbance values at 500 and 550 nm after color developed with vanillin/HCl reagent and after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was found between the TAA values and total phenolics (P = 0.01), TAA and tannins determined by vanillin method (P = 0.05), TAA and tannins determined after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis (P = 0.05), SAI values and tannins determined with vanillin method (P = 0.10), SAI values and tannins determined after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis (P = 0.05), SAI values and total phenolics (P = 0.01), total phenolics and tannin content determined by vanillin method (P = 0.01), total phenolics and tannin content determined after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis (P = 0.05), tannins determined with vanillin method and tannins determined after n-butanol hydrolysis (P = 0.02).",1
"The effect of extraction systems on the phenolic composition of virgin olive oils obtained from two different Italian cultivars (Coratina and Oliarola) was determined. The oils extracted using two-phase centrifugation showed in all cases higher phenolic concentration in comparison to oils obtained from three-phase centrifugation. In particular, the highest differences were observed for aglykone derivatives of oleuropein (3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA) that are the most concentrated antioxidant phenolic compounds of virgin olive oil. These results were confirmed by the autoxidation stability of the oils examined.",1
"Public speaking (PS) is frequently necessary in many professional, educational, and personal settings. Mastering this communication skill is particularly important in today's society. Training techniques for PS have been described in the literature. Given that PS anxiety affects performance, especially voice characteristics and speech fluency, the purpose of this scoping review is to examine, map, and narratively summarize the available evidence on PS interventions that target or affect voice or speech. An extensive literature search was conducted in three bibliographic databases: Medline ALL/Ovid, PsycINFO/Ovid, and Eric/Ovid. Of the 850 studies identified, 22 met the eligibility criteria, and one was added from the reference lists of the included studies. A total of 23 studies were included. The interventions identified aim to improve speaking skills either by explicitly targeting the voice or speech (direct intervention, n = 15) or by targeting the cognitive, behavioral, psychological, or physical environment impacting the speaker's production (indirect intervention, n = 8). This scoping review provides the first published methodological summary of the characteristics of existing PS interventions that target or affect voice and speech. Heterogeneous characteristics were observed. Further studies are needed to determine which interventions are most effective.",0
"Under standardized conditions, the combined montoring of UV absorbance (A 280) and fluorescence intensity (IF) at 390 or 393 nm (on excitation at 300 or 340 nm, respectively) provides a diagnostic criterion for the identification of cinnamic and benzoic acid derivatives by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic separations of natural phenolic acids. The method can easily be used to determine the concentrations of these compounds if 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid is applied as an internal standard. When applied to a saponified rye kernel water extract, ferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic, syringic and vanillic acids were shown to be present.",1
"Paediatric patients with relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) have poor prognosis, as relapse-causing clones are often refractory to common chemotherapeutics. While the molecular mechanisms leading to chemoresistance are varied, significant evidence suggests interactions between B-ALL blasts and cells within the bone marrow microenvironment modulate chemotherapy sensitivity. Importantly, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and BM adipocytes are known to support B-ALL cells through multiple distinct molecular mechanisms. This review discusses the contribution of integrin-mediated B-ALL/BM-MSC signalling and asparagine supplementation in B-ALL chemoresistance. In addition, the role of adipocytes in sequestering anthracyclines and generating a BM niche favourable for B-ALL survival is explored. Furthermore, this review discusses the role of BM-MSCs and adipocytes in promoting a quiescent and chemoresistant B-ALL phenotype. Novel treatments which target these mechanisms are discussed herein, and are needed to improve dismal outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory disease.",0
"Ocular relapse in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is rare and typically associated with central nervous system or bone marrow involvement. Anterior segment infiltration as the sole manifestation of relapse is exceptionally uncommon and may mimic noninfectious uveitis, leading to diagnostic delay. We report the case of a 4-year-old boy with a history of B-cell precursor ALL, diagnosed at age 2 and treated according to the ALL IC BFM 2009 protocol. The patient remained in remission until presenting with persistent redness and irritation of the left eye, unresponsive to topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics. Slit-lamp examination revealed sectoral iris thickening, which was further assessed using ultrasound biomicroscopy and confirmed localized stromal infiltration without ciliary body involvement. The posterior segment was unremarkable. Initial systemic reevaluation showed no evidence of hematologic or CNS relapse, and at that time, ocular findings were provisionally considered an isolated recurrence. However, ∼3 months after the onset of ocular symptoms, the patient exhibited hematologic abnormalities, and relapse was confirmed with 31% circulating blasts, thrombocytopenia, and 92% blasts in bone marrow aspirate. He was subsequently reclassified as high-risk and systemic therapy was resumed. This case illustrates a rare presentation of anterior segment involvement as the initial manifestation of relapse in pediatric ALL. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when evaluating persistent or atypical anterior uveitis in leukemia survivors, as early recognition of ocular involvement may be critical for timely diagnosis and treatment of systemic recurrence.",0
"Cocoa-phytochemicals have been related to the health-benefits of cocoa consumption. Metabolomics has been proposed as a powerful tool to characterize both the intake and the effects on the metabolism of dietary components. Human urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of phytochemicals and its relation with human health.",1
"Leukemia is one of the leading childhood malignancies, with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) being the most common type. Invasive fungal disease is a concerning problem also at pediatric hemato-oncology units. Available guidelines underline the need for antifungal prophylaxis and give recommendations for proper treatment in various clinical scenarios. Nonetheless, antifungal agents are often involved in drug-drug interaction (DDI) occurrence. The prediction of those interactions in the pediatric population is complicated because of the physiological differences in adults, and the lack of pharmacological data. In this review, we discuss the potential DDIs between antifungal agents and commonly used pharmaceutics in pediatric hemato-oncology settings, with special emphasis on the use of liposomal amphotericin B and ALL treatment. We obtained information from Micromedex",0
"Approximately 130 000 infants acquire HIV annually despite global maternal antiretroviral therapy scale-up. We evaluated the potential clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of offering long-acting, anti-HIV broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) prophylaxis to infants in three distinct settings. We simulated infants in Côte d'Ivoire, South Africa, and Zimbabwe using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-Pediatric (CEPAC-P) model. We modeled strategies offering a three-bNAb combination in addition to WHO-recommended standard-of-care oral prophylaxis to infants: a) with known, WHO-defined high-risk HIV exposure at birth ( The base case model projects that bNAb strategies targeting Adding long-acting bNAbs to current standard-of-care prophylaxis would be cost-effective, assuming plausible efficacies and costs. The cost-effective target population would vary by setting, largely driven by maternal antenatal HIV prevalence and postpartum incidence.",0
"Fourteen phenolic acids have been selectively determined in olive-oil samples using the co-electrosmotic capillary electrophoresis mode with UV detection after the LLE extraction system. A polycationic surfactant (hexadimetrine bromide, HDB), which dynamically coats the inner surface of the capillary and causes a fast anodic electroosmotic flow, was added to the electrolyte. The main factors affecting co-electroosmotic flow (EOF) such as type of modifier, concentration, and influence of organic solvents have been studied. Other parameters such as pH, type, and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and injection time were also optimised using hydrodynamic injection for 8 s and UV detection at 210 nm. The composition optimum of the running buffer used was a 20% 2-propanol, 0.001% HDB, and 50 mM sodium borate at a pH value of 9.6. The method has been applied to determination and quantification of fourteen phenolic acids at ppb levels in olive oil samples after a liquid-liquid extraction.",1
"1. Nine habitual tea-drinking volunteers were recruited and asked to follow a low-polyphenol and low-caffeine diet for 6 days and to provide daily 24-h urine samples. On day 4 of the experiment strong black tea brewed under standardized conditions was re-introduced to the volunteers' diet. 2. 1H-NMR and HPLC profiling of the urine samples indicated that consumption of black tea (6-10 mugs per day) was associated with a significant (p = 0.00017) increase in hippuric acid excretion relative to control, increasing from 153-512 to 742-1374 mg day(-1). The excretion of substantial amounts of hippuric acid has not previously been associated with black tea consumption. 3. For some volunteers, the quantity of benzoic acid processed exceeded the acceptable daily intake (ADI), but this is not considered to constitute any hazard. 4. A mass-balance analysis indicated that the necessary quantity of benzoic acid could not be obtained from the contents of gallic acid, flavanols, flavonol glycosides and theaflavins in black tea even if 100% transformation was obtained, suggesting that the thearubigins (the major and chemically ill-defined polyphenols of black tea) may be an important source.",1
"A simple and rapid capillary electrophoresis method was developed for the identification and quantitative determination of two antioxidative compounds – carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid – in the extracts of commercial Sage (Salvia officinalis) tea-bags. Capillary zone electrophoretic separation of carnosic and rosmarinic acids was performed using 40 mmol/l borate, at pH 9.6 as the running buffer. Weighed sage samples were extracted from tea-bags by sonification and the extracts were directly injected without any purification and pre-separation process. Coumarin was used as internal standard for quantitation and the limits of detection for carnosic acid and rosmarinic acid were obtained as 2.79 and 3.18 μg/ml, respectively using UV detection at 210 nm.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies show considerable clinical efficacy in patients with B cell malignancies, but their efficacy is limited in patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). CD5 is expressed on ∼85 % of malignant T cells, and CD5-targeting CAR-T cells can exhibit potent antitumor activity against T-ALL. However, optimization of CAR costimulatory endo-, hinge, and transmembrane domains could further increase their expansion and persistence, thereby enhancing their efficacy following exposure to tumor cells. Here we designed CD5-specific CARs with different molecular structures to generate CAR-T cells and investigated their anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. CD5 CARs with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain (BB.z) or a CD28 costimulatory domain (28.z) exhibited specific cytotoxicity against CD5",0
"Based on new data and increased understanding of disease molecular genetics, the international consensus classification (ICC) has made several changes in the diagnosis and classification of eosinophilic disorders and systemic mastocytosis. Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia (M/LN-eo) and gene rearrangements have been renamed as M/LN-eo with tyrosine kinase gene fusions (M/LN-eo-TK). The category has been expanded to include ETV6::ABL1 and FLT3 fusions, and to accept PCM1::JAK2 and its genetic variants as formal members. The overlaps and differences between M/LN-eo-TK and BCR::ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/de novo T-ALL sharing the same genetic lesions are addressed. Besides genetics, ICC for the first time has introduced bone marrow morphologic criteria in distinguishing idiopathic hypereosinophilia/hypereosinophilic syndrome from chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified. The major diagnostic criteria for systemic mastocytosis (SM) in the ICC remain largely based on morphology, but several minor modifications/refinements have been made in criteria related to diagnosis, subclassification, and assessment of disease burden (B- and C-findings). This review is to focus on the ICC updates related to these disease entities, illustrated through changes related to morphology, molecular genetics, clinical features, prognosis, and treatment. Two practical algorithms are provided in navigating through the diagnosis and classification systems of hypereosinophilia and SM.",0
"In acute leukemia, many associations have been identified between prognosis and some factors, such as individual antigen expression, cytogenetics, gender, age, high leukocyte level (WBC), platelet count (PLT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but few are consistent. In this study, we aimed to investigate the cell surface markers and other clinical pathological features for prognosis determination in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients in our population. This cross-sectional study was performed from January 2017 to December 2023 in İstanbul Training and Research Hospital and included 113 patients (86 AML and 27 ALL) newly diagnosed with AML (non-APL) and ALL. The following tests were fulfilled for the included patients: complete blood count (CBC), LDH, and flow cytometric analysis using a blood sample or bone marrow aspirate. The effects of surface markers, gender, age, WBC, PLT, and LDH on 24-month survival were evaluated retrospectively. Among the investigated parameters, lack of CD13 expression and positive CD10, cTdT expressions were associated with poor prognosis in AML patients (p = 0.01, p = 0.04, and p = 0.04, respectively). We have found no association between the surface markers and other parameters with prognosis in ALL patients. Age > 65 years was associated with poor prognosis in both AML and ALL patients (p < 0.001). CD10, cTdT positivity, and CD13 negativity may predict poor prognosis for AML and can be considered as prognostic biomarkers for AML patients.",0
"Human bioavailability of the flavonoid dihydrochalcones is little understood, and no evidence exists for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption in humans. The present study uses catechol-O-methyltransferase to generate methylated metabolites of aspalathin (a C-glycosyl dihydrochalcone from rooibos tea). One of the methylated forms, both with and without glucuronidation, was detected using LC-MS/MS in the urine of human subjects (n = 6), demonstrating that deglycosylation is not a prerequisite for C-glycosyl flavonoid absorption. Methylation is catalysed by both intestine and liver cytosolic extracts. The results show that flavonoid C-glycosides are methylated and glucuronidated in vivo in an intact form in humans.",1
"To investigate the incidence of Second-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing were used to detect 51 gene mutations, and multiplex-PCR was used to detect 41 fusion genes from 451 newly diagnosed adult AML patients admitted to Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, Changzhou Second People's Hospital, Wuxi People's Hospital and Wuxi Second People's Hospital from January 2017 to July 2022.

"Four sweet cherry cultivars (cvs), Burlat, Saco, Summit and Van, were analysed at harvest and after storage at 2 and 15 °C for 30 and 6 days respectively. Phenolic profiles in methanolic extracts of freeze-dried samples of the fresh and differently stored cherries were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Hydroxycinnamates dominated in all samples and represented 60–74% by weight of the phenols in the fresh and stored samples of the cvs Saco, Summit and Van, and 45% by weight of the phenols in the cv Burlat samples, which were richer in anthocyanins. The relative and total levels of hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan-3-ols varied among cultivars and during storage. Storage at 15 °C increased the phenol levels, particularly the cyanidin-3-rutinoside concentration. Cold storage induced decreased total phenol levels in the cvs Summit and Van but increased total phenol levels in the cvs Burlat and Saco. Phenolic cherry extracts inhibited low-density lipoprotein oxidation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Extracts of freshly harvested cherries exhibited significantly higher antioxidant activities than extracts of stored samples. The cv Summit samples had the highest antioxidant activity. Differences in the antioxidant effects of the cherry samples were positively correlated with their levels of p-coumaroylquinic acid (p < 0.1) but negatively correlated with their cyanidin-3-rutinoside levels (p < 0.05).

"Recent advancements in risk stratification have greatly improved outcomes in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Despite favorable prognostic indicators, including the absence of cytogenetic abnormalities and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, relapse remains a major clinical concern. We investigated the clinical significance of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) clonality using RNA sequencing data in BCP-ALL. We analyzed IGH clonality from 136 patients. IGH abundance followed a power law distribution, which enabled us to identify disease clones as outliers based on read count. In total, 330 disease clones were detected, and patients were categorized into three clonotype groups: undetectable disease clone (UDC), incomplete disease clone (IDC), and complete disease clone (CDC). Clinical outcomes were compared across clonotypes, including in subgroups with high hyperdiploidy (HHD) and MRD negativity. Among patients with HHD, significant prognostic differences were observed across clonotypes (event-free survival [EFS], p = 0.01; overall survival [OS], p = 0.08), even among those who were MRD-negative (EFS, p = 0.01; OS, p = 0.03). Furthermore, comparisons of IGH sequences between diagnosis and relapse indicated that while initial disease clones often contributed to relapse, newly expanded clones frequently emerged, particularly in patients with HHD. These findings highlight the importance of analyzing the IGH repertoire in refining risk stratification and underscore the need for advanced sequencing-based MRD monitoring.",0
"A new class of phenolic compounds, hydroxy-isochromans, was found in different samples of extra-virgin olive oil. In particular, the presence of l-phenyl-6,7-dihydroxy-isochroman, 10 and 1-(3′-methoxy-4′-hydroxy)phenyl-6,7-dihydroxy-isochroman, 11 was demonstrated by comparison of the high performance liquid chromatography–mass/mass (HPLC–MS/MS) spectra of biophenolic samples from extra-virgin olive oils with those of compounds obtained by a reaction between hydroxytyrosol and the aromatic aldehydes, benzaldehyde and vanillin, respectively.",1
"Black tea, green tea, red wine, and cocoa are high in phenolic phytochemicals, among which theaflavin, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, and procyanidin, respectively, have been extensively investigated due to their possible role as chemopreventive agents based on their antioxidant capacities. The present study compared the phenolic and flavonoid contents and total antioxidant capacities of cocoa, black tea, green tea, and red wine. Cocoa contained much higher levels of total phenolics (611 mg of gallic acid equivalents, GAE) and flavonoids (564 mg of epicatechin equivalents, ECE) per serving than black tea (124 mg of GAE and 34 mg of ECE, respectively), green tea (165 mg of GAE and 47 mg of ECE), and red wine (340 mg of GAE and 163 mg of ECE). Total antioxidant activities were measured using the 2,2‘-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays and are expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacities (VCEACs). Cocoa exhibited the highest antioxidant activity among the samples in ABTS and DPPH assays, with VCEACs of 1128 and 836 mg/serving, respectively. The relative total antioxidant capacities of the samples in both assays were as follows in decreasing order:  cocoa > red wine > green tea > black tea. The total antioxidant capacities from ABTS and DPPH assays were highly correlated with phenolic content (r 2 = 0.981 and 0.967, respectively) and flavonoid content (r 2 = 0.949 and 0.915). These results suggest that cocoa is more beneficial to health than teas and red wine in terms of its higher antioxidant capacity.",1
"T lymphocyte acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is frequently associated with increased expression of the E protein transcription factor inhibitors TAL1 and LYL1. In mouse models, ectopic expression of TAL1 or LYL1 in T cell progenitors, or inactivation of E2A, is sufficient to predispose mice to develop T-ALL. How E2A suppresses thymocyte transformation is currently unknown. Here, we show that early deletion of E2a, prior to the DN3 stage, was required for robust leukemogenesis and was associated with alterations in thymus cellularity, T cell differentiation, and gene expression in immature CD4",0
"Bioactive compounds were investigated in genotypes (cauliflower 10, white cabbage 10, curly kale 1) and plant parts of the three crops. The content of most of the major glucosinolates glucobrassicin, sinigrin and glucoiberin differed significantly between cultivars. Samples harvested in 2000 had higher amounts of several glucosinolates than samples from 1999. Within cauliflower the buds of the floret had 1.5 to 2.5-fold higher concentration of glucobrassicin and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin than the stalk. In white cabbage several glucosinolates had their highest content in the outer leaves (up to 2-fold higher). Upper leaves of curly kale contained 5-fold more of total glucosinolates than lower leaves. Chlorogenic acid was the dominating hydroxycinnamate in curly kale, which also contained at least ten times more of carotenoids (mainly lutein) than white cabbage. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assayed with the FRAP method was 0.76 (0.06) µmol/g fw (mean (SD)) in water-soluble and 0.32 (0.04) in water-insoluble extracts of cauliflower which was 62–68% higher than in white cabbage. Curly kale contained 6.4 and 6.1 µmol/g fw TAC in water-soluble and water-insoluble extracts. TAC did not differ between plant parts. Progoitrin and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin were correlated to water-soluble TAC in white cabbage, probably reflecting a variation in other compounds. Cauliflower contained less glucose, fructose and sorbitol but more sucrose than white cabbage. Curly kale had lower contents of glucose (∼2 times), fructose (∼4–5 times) and sucrose (20 and 36 times, respectively) than cauliflower and white cabbage, while inositol was only found in curly kale. Storage of white cabbage reduced the amount of sorbitol and sucrose. The study shows that cultivar, plant part and storage affect the content of bioactive compounds in Brassica vegetables. The variation between years, as in cauliflower, is due to environmental factors. Since the cultivar ranking order was rather stable for several components the data could provide a basis for the selection of cultivars optimised for valuable health components for fresh market consumption.

"A LC-MS method was developed for the determination of coumarin, vanillin, and ethyl vanillin in vanilla products. Samples were analyzed using LC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS in the positive ionization mode. Limits of detection for the method ranged from 0.051 to 0.073 microg mL(-1). Using the optimized method, 24 vanilla products were analyzed. All samples tested negative for coumarin. Concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 8.59 mg mL(-1) (x =3.73) for vanillin and 0.33 to 2.27 mg mL(-1) (x =1.03) for ethyl vanillin. The measured concentrations are compared to values calculated using UV monitoring and to results reported in a similar survey in 1988. Analytical results, method precision, and accuracy data are presented.",1
"The concentrations of the major tea flavanols in nine green teas from China and Japan have been investigated. Results show that epi-gallocatechin (EGC) is the most prevalent flavanol and not epi-gallocatechin gallate (EGCG) as previously thought. Studies of the equilibrium behaviour of extraction of tea flavanols and caffeine into aqueous media at 80°C and 60°C for one of the teas, Sen Cha Uji Tsuyu, indicate that extraction efficiencies are similar to that for extraction of soluble components from black teas. These studies also support the idea of EGC being the flavanol with the highest concentration. This is of relevance to the current interest in tea flavanols as antimutagenic agents in the treatment of cancers. From the flavanol content results there appears to be a correlation between the amount of flavanol and the price of the tea. It is possible that this might be used to aid the pricing of green teas at auction.",1
"This study aimed to assess programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) expression in newly diagnosed pediatric cases of acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and at 6 months of treatment and to explore their value as biomarkers. Fifty newly diagnosed B-ALL patients and 30 controls were recruited. Bone marrow samples or peripheral blood were obtained from children at diagnosis and 6 months after cytotoxic therapy. Flow cytometric analysis of obtained samples was done and the PD-1, PDL-1, and CD3 (cluster of differentiation) expressions were recorded. Percentages of PD-1, PDL-1, and CD3 in the control and B-ALL groups at initial presentation were 7.9% ± 2.8% vs. 16.45% ± 7.7% (p = 0.023), 8.6% ± 3.4% vs. 19.05% ± 13.7% (p < 0.001), and 30.8% ± 1.2% vs. 11.05% ± 7.3% (p < 0.001), respectively. CD3 expression increased significantly at 6 months; PD-1 and PDL-1 expression showed insignificant decrease from initial presentation. There was a negative correlation between PD-1 and HB level (p = 0.03) and a positive correlation between PD-1 and PDL-1 at 6 months of treatment (p = 0.002). Remission rates increased significantly with the decrease of PD-1and PDL-1. Initially, PD-1 and PDL-1 were higher in patients than in controls and decreased 6 months after treatment. PD-1 and PDL-1 expression was associated with increased remission rates, implicating that modulation of PD-1 and PDL-1 expression may be a therapeutic approach for B-ALL. Moreover, this study created a new method for the assessment of PD-1 and PDL-1 in B-ALL. Trial Registration: NCT05428111.",0
"The effects of fermenting, boiling, and steaming processes on the levels of free amino acids, organic acids, antioxidant properties (FRAP and DPPH), phenolic compounds, and angiotensine converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition of sweet potato tips were investigated. Seventeen free amino acids were found in the tips. Fermenting, boiling, and steaming processes significantly reduced total free amino acid contents and steaming processes caused smaller losses than fermenting and boiling processes. Five organic acids were investigated in the tips. In comparison with the total organic acid content of unprocessed sweet potato tips, steaming and boiling processes significantly reduced it, while fermenting process increased it. Chlorogenic acid, rutin, and quercetin were investigated in the tips. The total phenolic compounds contents of sweet potato tips significantly increased by steaming and boiling processes, but a substantial loss was caused by fermenting process. A similar result was shown in FRAP value. The result of ACE inhibitory activity indicated that boiling, steaming, and fermenting processes significantly increased ACE inhibitory activity.",1
"The content of the potentially anticarcinogenic flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin, and luteolin of commonly consumed beverages was determined by RP-HPLC with UV detection. Flavonoid levels in beer, coffee, chocolate milk, and white wine were below 1 mg/L. Twelve types of tea infusion, six types of wine, apple juice, tomato juice, grape juice, orange juice, grapefruit juice, and lemon juice were analyzed. No luteolin or apigenin were detected in any of the beverages. In red wines and in grape juice quercetin and myricetin levels varying from 4 to 16 mg/L and from 7 to 9 mg/L, respectively, were detected. Quercetin levels in fruit juices were generally below 5 mg/L except for lemon juice (7 mg/L) and tomato juice (13 mg/L). In black tea infusions quercetin (10-25 mg/L), kaempferol (7-17 mg/L), and myricetin (2-5 mg/L) were detected. Flavonoid levels in green tea were comparable to those in black tea. The flavonoid content of tea prepared with tea bags was generally higher than that of tea prepared with loose leaves. Together with data on the flavonoid content of vegetables and fruits published previously (Hertog et al. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1992, 40, 2379-2383), these data provide a base for an epidemiological evaluation of the potentially anticarcinogenic effects of flavonoids.",1
"A rapid fluorometric technique was used to analyze the alkylresorcinol content in the seed of 397 spring and winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cultivars. The alkylresorcinol content ranged from a low of 0.036% to a high of 0.322%, the greater variability being in the spring cultivars. A number of the spring cultivars were planted and self-pollinated through four generations. Each cultivar progeny was selected for high and low alkylresorcinol content in the seed, high self-fertility, and superior seed characteristics. It was apparent that selection was effective in increasing and decreasing alkylresorcinol content with each successive self-pollinated generation.",1
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a hematological malignancy characterized by the aberrant accumulation of malignant and immature B cells in the bone marrow. Recent reports including ours have demonstrated that RNA modifications play pivotal roles in B-ALL progression and drug resistance. In the current study, we show that fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), a demethylase of N",0
"Despite major therapeutic advances in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), resistances and long-term toxicities still pose significant challenges. Cyclins and their associated cyclin-dependent kinases are one focus of cancer research when looking for targeted therapies. We discovered cyclin C to be a key factor for B-cell ALL (B-ALL) development and maintenance. While cyclin C is not essential for normal hematopoiesis, CcncΔ/Δ BCR::ABL1+ B-ALL cells fail to elicit leukemia in mice. RNA sequencing experiments revealed a p53 pathway deregulation in CcncΔ/Δ BCR::ABL1+ cells resulting in the inability of the leukemic cells to adequately respond to stress. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function screen supplemented with additional knock-outs unveiled a dependency of human B-lymphoid cell lines on CCNC. High cyclin C levels in B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL patients were associated with poor event-free survival and increased risk of early disease recurrence after remission. Our findings highlight cyclin C as a potential therapeutic target for B-ALL, particularly to enhance cancer cell sensitivity to stress and chemotherapy.",0
"Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) is occasionally expressed in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), and this causes difficulty in differential diagnosis from B-lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL). We reviewed 31 cases of TdT-positive LBCL and B-ALL/LBL, and their final diagnosis included 19 diffuse large/high-grade BCLs with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (five DLBCL-MYC/BCL2, 14 HGBCL-MYC/BCL2), three DLBCL not otherwise specified (NOS), three HGBCL-NOS, four B-ALL/LBL, and two unclassifiable cases. TdT was variably expressed in all these cases, without any clear demarcation among different groups. Loss or partial loss of CD20 expression was seen in 13/17 DLBCL/HGBCL-MYC/BCL2, 2/3 HGBCL-NOS, and 2/2 unclassified, albeit not in DLBCL-NOS. Expression of BCL6 and/or MUM1 was seen in 3/4 B-ALL/LBLs and 2/2 unclassified. Next-generation sequencing revealed characteristic mutations associated with follicular lymphoma and its high-grade transformation in each DLBCL/HGBCL-MYC/BCL2, and also frequent variants in genes targeted by somatic hypermutation (SHM) in almost all DLBCL/HGBCL-MYC/BCL2, DLBCL-NOS, and HGBCL-NOS but one case. In contrast, such mutations were absent in B-ALL/LBL. There were no pathognomonic mutations in the two unclassifiable cases, although one showed a moderate level of somatic mutations in its rearranged IGHV. Furthermore, in three cases of TdT-positive HGBCL-MYC/BCL2, studies of previous or concurrent follicular lymphoma demonstrated their divergent evolution from an IGH::BCL2-positive cell population following acquisition of MYC translocation. In conclusion, mutation profiling analysis including the SHM target genes is highly valuable in the differential diagnosis between TdT-positive LBCL and B-ALL/LBL. © 2025 The Author(s).

"Chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients largely benefit from an expanding tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) toolbox that has improved the outcome of both diseases. However, TKI success is continuously challenged by mutation-driven acquired resistance and therefore, close monitoring of clonal genetic diversity is necessary to ensure proper clinical management and adequate response to treatment. Here, we report the case of a ponatinib-resistant Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL) patient harboring a BCR::ABL1 p.I293_K294insSLLRD mutation. Using in vitro proliferation assays on newly generated Ba/F3 cell lines, we confirmed that the mutation confers moderate resistance to ponatinib, and to imatinib and nilotinib. In contrast, BCR::ABL1",0
"Glucose deprivation in T lymphocytes can trigger compensatory metabolic pathways, potentially contributing to T-cell exhaustion. Additionally, it may induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), ultimately resulting in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To examine the transcriptional profiles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers and T-cell exhaustion indicators in CD8+ T lymphocytes isolated from B-ALL patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 22 untreated B-ALL patients and 22 healthy controls. Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) was used to isolate CD8+ T lymphocytes. The relative gene expression was then assessed using qRT-PCR with primers specific to XBP1, CHOP, GLUT1, and T-bet. The ER stress response was significantly activated in CD8+ T lymphocytes from B-ALL patients, as evidenced by significant increase in both XBP1 and CHOP transcript levels, relative to normal donors. Although GLUT1 mRNA expression was significantly higher than in control groups, T-bet expression showed no significant difference between the two groups. Collectively, our gene expression data suggest ER stress activation in CD8+ T lymphocytes from B-ALL patients. These findings warrant further investigation into ER stress-related signaling pathways and their potential role in promoting T-cell exhaustion in B-ALL.",0
"Six bean cultivars grown in southern Manitoba for 2 years were evaluated for variability in yield of millstreams and phenolic constituents. The ethanolic extract of bean cultivars and millstreams was screened for antioxidant activity using the β-carotene-linoleate and the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. Cultivar was the main source of variation for yield of millstreams, content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities. Phenolic compounds in cultivars varied from 3.3 to 16.6 mg catechin equivalent and from 0.15 to 0.32 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalent g−1 bean for total phenolic and anthocyanin contents, respectively. The bean cultivars exhibited antioxidant activity (AA) of 10–46% inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the linoleate and 0.4–1.3 trolox equivalent antioxidant capacities (TEAC) in the DPPH model systems. The hull millstream with maximum concentration of phenolic compounds exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity of 383 µM trolox equivalent g−1 hull. Total phenolic content, alone or in combination with other phenolic constituents, is a potential candidate as a selection criterion for antioxidant activity in beans.",1
"The phenolic component of freeze-dried olive fruit was fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography using ultraviolet, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) and electrospray ionisation (ESI) detection. The fractions together with several standards were tested for antioxidant activity in an aqueous and a lipid system. The negative ion mode of APCI and ESI showed less fragmentation than positive ion mode. The latter was generally more useful in obtaining fragmentation data and hence structural information. Some olive phenolics notably tyrosol exhibited a low ionisation efficiency in both APCI and ESI. There was no simple relationship between antioxidant activity and chemical structure. The ranking of antioxidant activity was strongly dependent on both the test system and on the substrate demonstrating the need to examine activity in both aqueous and lipid systems. Significant antioxidant activity was seen in most olive fractions and this was related to phenolic content. The kinetics of the oxidation process are complex and suggest that multiple pathways may be involved at different antioxidant concentrations.",1
"Blinatumomab is a CD3/CD19-directed bispecific T-cell engager used to treat relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Although blinatumomab has shown efficacy, it can cause serious adverse events, including cytokine release syndrome and neurological events. Among the neurological events, encephalopathy is rare, and knowledge is lacking. Herein, we present a pediatric case of blinatumomab-associated encephalopathy that initially presented with refractory convulsions and later developed into a cerebral infarction. The patient experienced prolonged paralysis and increased brain damage.",0
"Human milk from the breast is the healthiest option for infants. Other sources of nutrition pose some risk to child, maternal, and environmental health. There are significant costs to suboptimal rates of breastfeeding for children, families and society. Over 92% of mothers in Ontario, Canada initiate breastfeeding, yet exclusivity and duration rates decline over time. This study estimates potential pediatric healthcare cost savings from increased exclusive breastfeeding. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare healthcare savings from enhanced breastfeeding rates against current practices by estimating pediatric healthcare costs associated with suboptimal breastfeeding and potential savings from improved rates. Savings are calculated from reduced incidence of childhood illnesses associated with breastfeeding, including lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), gastrointestinal infections (GII), acute otitis media (AOM), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), childhood obesity, and asthma. Cost data were drawn from Canadian healthcare sources, supplemented with data from the UK and other international studies. We used initiation and exclusive breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge and six months postpartum. The study assumes that the incidence of preventable conditions like LRTI, GII, and AOM is directly related to breastfeeding rates at these time points. A six-month threshold for exclusive breastfeeding, recommended by the World Health Organization, was selected for analysis. Partial breastfeeding rates were not separately modeled due to data limitations. Improving exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates at six months to match rates at hospital discharged and initiation rates could result in 47,114-91,457 fewer cases of LRTI, GII, and AOM, prevent 3,685-7,096 hospitalizations, and reduce 22,043-47,621 outpatient visits. Increased EBF rates could prevent cases of NEC (37-67), ALL (3-6), childhood obesity (1,199-2,661), and asthma (970-2,111). Suboptimal breastfeeding at 6 months for infants born in Ontario in 2019 cost the healthcare system US $72.2 million annually for treating four childhood illnesses and US $61.0 million for long-term conditions (ALL, obesity, and asthma). Increasing breastfeeding rates could save US $32-63 million in annual treatment costs and US $23.6-51.6 million in long-term healthcare costs. Suboptimal breastfeeding rates impose a burden on the health of families and Ontario's healthcare system. Supporting breastfeeding through evidence-based interventions could reduce this burden through lowering pediatric healthcare demands.",0
"MiR-326 downregulation is strongly associated with multidrug resistance (MDR) and has been identified as an adverse prognostic biomarker for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL). The choice to study miR-326 as a tumor suppressor in cancer biology, particularly its regulation of apoptosis, drug resistance, and stemness, stems from its strong association with MDR and potential as a therapeutic target in pALL. The current study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of miR-326 in ALL, using Gene Ontology annotation network and multilayer network analysis. Our findings revealed that miR-326 exhibits a multifunctional anti-tumor behavior, affecting various aspects of drug resistance, stemness, and apoptosis in cancer, particularly in the context of ALL. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated downregulation of the ABC transporter mRNAs ABCC1 and ABCB1 but not ABCA3 in B-ALL cells transfected with miR-326 mimic, as confirmed by bioinformatic data. Western blot analysis showed a possible cross talk between miR-326 and P53 through the upregulation of Mdm2 and P53 proteins. The heightened functional activity of P53 was subsequently validated through the observed augmentation in levels of P21 and CCND1, alongside the evident disruption in the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Bax genes. Subsequently, the ceRNA network between miR-326 and LncRNAs was exhibited and the impact of exogenous miR-326 on the expression levels of its molecular sponges, H19 and SNHG1 was examined using RT-qPCR. Future studies will explore the potential impact of miR-326 on its targets, and how this may influence the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ALL.",0
"To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight (BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and metabolism of ACNs.",1
"The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC and for future elucidation of its biological activities.",1
"Four different antioxidant tests (ABTS*+, DPPH, ORAC, beta-carotene-linoleate model system) were used to determine the free-radical scavenging activity of 39 extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) and compare the total phenol content by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The correlation between the total phenols and antioxidant capacities measured by the four methods was very high, and highest with ABTS*+ (R2 = 0.9905). Some of these methods of measurement were applied to olive-oil samples (OO), with approximately a 50% decrease in the value of the antioxidant capacity in comparison with values found for EVOO. In conclusion, the results show that all the methods tested were suitable for determining the antioxidant capacity of olive oil. The Picual variety of extra-virgin olive oil showed high antioxidant activity.",1
"The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.",1
"Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) represent between 3 and 5% of childhood AL. This term encompasses many subtypes of AL that have been defined according to the immunophenotypic profile based on the expression of various lineage markers. This classification has been modified and enriched during the last decade thanks to the improvement of molecular biology techniques, which have led to reconsider the ontogenic proximity existing between certain forms of ALAL. This increasing diagnostic complexity justifies the establishment of a close communication between clinicians and biologists in the management of these rare forms of AL. Indeed, the initial classification remains the cornerstone of their management since it conditions the future choice of therapeutic protocol. Thus, with the notable exception of undifferentiated forms of AL or AUL (for acute undetermined leukemia), it is now accepted that ALAL benefit from a lymphoid-based therapy approach. As with the management of ""classic"" acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), the evaluation of response to treatment will determine the modalities of therapeutic intensification. The objective of improving the prognosis of ALAL justifies, in the long term, their future inclusion in the international ALLTogether protocol while continuing in-depth molecular exploration of these patients to identify targeted therapies.",0
"Determination of free gallic acid and catechin (cianidanol) in banana samples was optimized using a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line photodiode array detection. This method was applied for cultivars of bananas (Gran Enana and Pequeña Enana) harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands) and for bananas (Gran Enana) from Ecuador. The contents of catechin and gallic acid in bananas from Ecuador were higher (P<0.05) and lower than in bananas produced in Tenerife. Variations in the contents of these polyphenolic compounds in the bananas from Tenerife according to cultivation method (greenhouse and outdoors), farming style (conventional and organic) and region of production (north and south) were observed.",1
"Applications of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) techniques coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the identification and determination of phase I and phase II drug metabolites are reviewed with an emphasis on recent papers published predominantly within the last 6 years (2002–2007) reporting the employment of atmospheric pressure ionization techniques as the most promising approach for a sensitive detection, positive identification and quantitation of metabolites in complex biological matrices. This review is devoted to in vitro and in vivo drug biotransformation in humans and animals. The first step preceding an HPLC-MS bioanalysis consists in the choice of suitable sample preparation procedures (biomatrix sampling, homogenization, internal standard addition, deproteination, centrifugation, extraction). The subsequent step is the right optimization of chromatographic conditions providing the required separation selectivity, analysis time and also good compatibility with the MS detection. This is usually not accessible without the employment of the parent drug and synthesized or isolated chemical standards of expected phase I and sometimes also phase II metabolites. The incorporation of additional detectors (photodiode-array UV, fluorescence, polarimetric and others) between the HPLC and MS instruments can result in valuable analytical information supplementing MS results. The relation among the structural changes caused by metabolic reactions and corresponding shifts in the retention behavior in reversed-phase systems is discussed as supporting information for identification of the metabolite. The first and basic step in the interpretation of mass spectra is always the molecular weight (MW) determination based on the presence of protonated molecules [M+H]+ and sometimes adducts with ammonium or alkali-metal ions, observed in the positive-ion full-scan mass spectra. The MW determination can be confirmed by the [M-H]- ion for metabolites providing a signal in negative-ion mass spectra. MS/MS is a worthy tool for further structural characterization because of the occurrence of characteristic fragment ions, either MSn analysis for studying the fragmentation patterns using trap-based analyzers or high mass accuracy measurements for elemental composition determination using time of flight based or Fourier transform mass analyzers. The correlation between typical functional groups found in phase I and phase II drug metabolites and corresponding neutral losses is generalized and illustrated for selected examples. The choice of a suitable ionization technique and polarity mode in relation to the metabolite structure is discussed as well.",1

"For patients with acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia (AML/ALL) lacking a matched sibling or unrelated donor, haploidentical stem cell transplantation (HAPLO-SCT) is increasingly used. However, available data on the treatment of relapse after HAPLO-SCT, including feasibility and efficacy of a second HAPLO-SCT (HAPLO-SCT2), is scarce. Hence, adults with AML/ALL, that had undergone HAPLO-SCT2 without ex-vivo manipulation after haematologic relapse from HAPLO-SCT1 were selected for a retrospective registry analysis. Eighty-two patients (AML, n = 63, ALL, n = 19, median follow-up: 33 months) were identified. Engraftment rate was 87%. At day +180, cumulative incidences of acute GvHD II-IV°/chronic GvHD were 23.9%/22.6%, respectively. Two-year overall survival/leukaemia-free survival (OS/LFS) were 34.3%/25.4%; 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse incidence (RI) were 17.6% and 57%. Leukaemia was the most frequent cause of death. Separated by disease, 2-year OS/LFS/NRM/RI were 28.7%/22.3%/16.2%/61.6% in AML, and 55.3%/38.4%/23.5%/38.2% in ALL patients. In a risk-factor analysis among patients with AML, stage at HAPLO-SCT1 and HAPLO-SCT2, and interval from HAPLO-SCT1 to relapse significantly influenced outcome. Our data demonstrate that HAPLO-SCT2 is a viable option in acute leukaemia relapse after HAPLO-SCT1. Engraftment, toxicity, risk factors and long-term outcome are comparable to data reported after allo-SCT2 in a matched donor setting.",0
"Eleven subjects completed a clinical trial to determine the safety/tolerability of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) and to measure, in plasma and urine, specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.",1
"Colour is an important criterion of quality in Asian noodles prepared from bread-wheat flour and ranges from white to cream for white salted noodles to a bright yellow for alkaline noodles. A high-performance liquid chromatographic protocol for the analysis of naturally occurring flavonoids and related phenolic compounds in wheat was developed to identify the compounds responsible for the yellow colour of alkaline noodles. The separation system consisted of a C18 reversed-phase column and a gradient system of water/formic acid (99:1,v/v) (A) and methanol/acetonitrile/formic acid (95:4:1,v/v/v) (B). A post column derivatisation technique was employed to identify the compounds that turned yellow at alkaline pH. A comparison of the HPLC profiles of water, alkaline water and hydroxylamine soluble fractions revealed that the level of compounds contributing to yellow alkaline noodle colour was highest in the hydroxylamine extract. Two flavonoid apigenin-C-diglycosides and their Wessely–Moser isomers, together with their sinapic acid esters, were isolated and identified by absorbance spectroscopy, ES-MS spectrometry and 13C NMR. These flavone-C-diglycosides were found to be the major components responsible for the alkali-induced change in noodle colour and are relatively stable at ambient temperature. Furthermore the compounds are located only in the germ (embryo+scutellum tissue) of wheat grains and hence their presence in flour must represent a redistribution during the milling process.",1
"NUP98 fusion genes are detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subgroups that have a poor prognosis. An appropriate therapeutic approach should therefore be established. Treatment intensification according to the minimal residual disease (MRD) level can lead to a better prognosis in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the importance of MRD monitoring in the patient with NUP98-positive AML is unclear. This study aimed to develop a digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method for monitoring NUP98::NSD1-positive leukemic cells and to report its utility compared with the results of NUP98 split fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The results of NUP98::NSD1 ddPCR correlated with those of NUP98 split FISH and were more sensitive than NUP98 split FISH. The sensitivity of ddPCR was 0.001%, equivalent to 1 in 1 × 10 The use of ddPCR to target NUP98::NSD1 chimera mRNA for MRD monitoring would be beneficial for NUP98::NSD1 AML treatment.",0
"Two avenanthramides belonging to a group of about 40 cinnamoylanthranilic acid derivatives in oat grains were isolated: N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-(E)-cinnamoyl)-5-hydroxyantranilic acid (A1) and, not previously reported, N-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxy-(E)-cinnamoyl)-5-hydroxy-4-methoxyanthranilic acid (A2). The antioxidative capacities of the two avenanthramides, A1 and A2, were determined by measuring the oxygen consumption in a linoleic acid system. A1 had approximately 20% of the activity exerted by alpha- tocopherol and A2 had approximately 60%. Caffeic and ferulic acid, known to be antioxidative, had much lower activities: 6 and 4%, respectively. A1 was preferentially located in the outer part of the grain. It seems to be quite heat stable, at least when located within the oat tissue during steam treatment. A comparison of 10 different cultivars of oats revealed that the amount of A1 varied between 40 and 132 micrograms per gram of grain. The amount of A2 is at least 10 times lower.",1
"The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 (0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).",1
"Preleukemic stem cells (PSC) containing preleukemic fusion genes (PFG) arise prenatally and represent the initial stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) development. Despite widespread efforts, the cell of origin of PFG is still unclear. For the first time, in order to identify the immunophenotype of the PSCs, different subpopulations of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) of umbilical cord blood (UCB) from ALL pediatric patients and control healthy children were sorted and analyzed for the presence of diagnostically-relevant PFGs by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Representative FISH results were confirmed by RT-qPCR and validated by sequencing of the products. Not only did we identify likely subpopulations of TEL/AML1+ PSC to be CD34+ CD38+ and CD34+ CD38- cells, but we also found markedly increased instability of often associated with ALL genes in UCB HSPC subpopulations of ALL pediatric patients. Our data show that CD34+ CD38+ as well as CD34+ CD38- cells are prone to genetic instability and most likely represent the target for malignant transformation in the development of ALL. Overall, together with confirming the prenatal origin of PFGs, this study provides further insight into the preleukemic stage of ALL and shows that ALL is a potentially screen able disease.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children, and methotrexate (MTX) is the key drug for ALL. Studies on the relationship between High-Dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) toxicity and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C genes have drawn different conclusions. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the polymorphism of The The Advancements in",0
"An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.",1
"To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant capacities of plums, the amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids and individual phenolic compounds, and vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) of eleven plum cultivars was determined. There was a good linear relationship between the amount of total phenolics and total antioxidant capacity (r2 = 0.9887). The amount of total flavonoids and total antioxidant capacity also showed a good correlation (r2 = 0.9653). Although the summation of individual antioxidant capacity was lower than the total antioxidant capacity of plum samples, there was a positive correlation (r2 = 0.9299) of total antioxidant capacity of plum samples with the sum of the VCEACs calculated from individual phenolics. Chlorogenic acids and glycosides of cyanidin, peonidin, and quercetin were major phenolics among eleven plum cultivars. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acids and anthocyanins showed higher correlation (r2) of 0.7751 and 0.6616 to total VCEAC, respectively, than that of quercetin glycosides (r2 = 0.0279). Chlorogenic acids were a major source of antioxidant activity in plums, and the consumption of one serving (100 g) of plums can provide antioxidants equivalent to 144.4-889.6 mg of vitamin C.",1
"Aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) of an extract prepared from moderately roasted sesame (180 °C; 10 min) revealed 41 odour-active volatiles, 31 of which could be identified by comparison of their mass spectra, retention indices, odour quality and odour threshold with reference compounds. Of the 18 aroma compounds showing very high Flavour Dilution factors in the range of 128–2048, 10 compounds [2-furfurylthiol, 2-phenylethylthiol, 2-methoxyphenol, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, 2-pentylpyridine, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, acetylpyrazine, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline and 4-vinyl-2-methoxy-phenol] were quantified by means of stable isotope dilution assays and their odour activity values (OAV; ratio of concentration to odour threshold) were calculated. On the basis of high OAVs in oil, especially 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (roasty), 2-furfurylthiol (coffee-like), 2-phenylethylthiol (rubbery) and 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (caramel-like) were elucidated as important contributors to the overall roasty, sulphury odour of the crushed sesame material.",1
"Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive (Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of flavonoids in salads.",1
"Measurable residual disease (MRD) is a powerful predictor of clinical outcomes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In addition to its clear prognostic importance, MRD information is increasingly used in clinical decision algorithms to guide therapeutic interventions. Although it is well established that achievement of MRD-negative remission is an important end point of ALL therapy, the prognostic and therapeutic implications of MRD in an individual patient are influenced by both disease-related factors (eg, cytomolecular risk) and assay-related factors (eg, sensitivity, specimen source, and timing of assessment), which add complexity to MRD-guided treatment decisions. In this review, we discuss the data supporting the use of MRD assessment in adult ALL and how this information can rationally inform clinical decisions, including selection of patients for MRD-directed therapies or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We also discuss important interpretative challenges related to novel high sensitivity next-generation sequencing-based MRD assays, which are becoming increasingly used in clinical practice.",0
"The alkylresorcinol (AR) content of Swedish wheat grain samples, as well as of cereal ingredients and cereal foods containing wheat and rye, was determined. The average total AR content in Swedish wheat was 412 microg/g (ranging between 227 and 639 microg/g), which is lower than that in Swedish rye analyzed in a previous study. The relative composition of AR homologues was consistent for wheat samples and differed markedly from that of rye. Notably, the ratio of the homologues C17:0/C21:0 was approximately 0.1 in wheat and approximately 1.0 in rye, indicating that it can be used to distinguish between those two cereals. The AR content in cereal foods commonly consumed in Sweden varied widely, from nondetectable levels in white wheat flour and products not containing the outer parts of wheat and/or rye to >900 microg/g in some whole grain rye products. AR content in cereal foods was calculated from their recipes using average AR values for the cereal ingredients determined in this study. As there was a good correlation between calculated and analyzed AR levels in cereal foods (R2 = 0.91), it is possible to estimate the proportion of whole grain wheat and/or rye in a given cereal product on the basis of AR content and C17:0/C21:0 ratio. ARs appear to be good markers of whole grain wheat and rye in foods, and their analysis may be an objective way to identify foods rich in whole grain wheat and/or rye or brans thereof.",1
"Today, acute lymphoblastic leukemia is one of the most common malignant diseases of the hematopoietic system. The genetic predisposition to ALL is not fully explored in various ethnic populations. The study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of the population frequencies of alleles and genotypes of polymorphic gene variants: immune regulation GATA3 (rs3824662); transcription and differentiation of B cells: ARID5B (rs7089424, rs10740055), IKZF1 (rs4132601); differentiation of hematopoietic cells: PIP4K2A (rs7088318); apoptosis: CEBPE (rs2239633), tumor suppressors: CDKN2A (rs3731249), TP53 (rs1042522); carcinogen metabolism: CBR3 (rs1056892), CYP1A1 (rs104894, rs4646903), according to genome-wide association studies analyses associated with the risk of developing pediatric beta-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-cell ALL), in an ethnically homogeneous population of Kazakhs with studied populations. The genomic database consists of 1800 conditionally healthy persons of Kazakh nationality, genotyped using OmniChip 2.5-8 Illumina chips at the deCODE genetics as part of the InterPregGen 7 project of the European Union (EU) framework program under Grant Agreement No. 282540. High population frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) minor alleles identified for immune regulation genes - GATA3 rs3824662 - 42.5%; transcription and differentiation of B-cells genes - ARID5B rs7089424 - 33.1% and rs10740055 - 48.5%, which suggests their significant genetic contribution to the risk of development and prognosis of the effectiveness of B-cell ALL therapy in the Kazakh population. The significantly lower population frequency of the minor allele G rs1056892 CBR3 gene - 38.6% in the Kazakhs suggests its significant protective effect in reducing the risk of childhood B-cell ALL and the smaller number of cardiac complications after anthracycline therapy. The obtained results will serve as a basis for developing effective methods for predicting the risk of development, early diagnosis, and effectiveness of treatment of B-cell ALL in children.",0
Minimal residual disease detection provides critical prognostic predictor of treatment outcome and is the standard of care for B lymphoblastic leukemia. Flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease detection is the most common test modality and has high sensitivity (0.01%) and a rapid turnaround time (24 hours). This article details the leukemia associated immunophenotype analysis approach for flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease detection used at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and importance of using guide gates and back-gating.,0
"Although chronic exposure to secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) was shown to alter (3)H-SDG metabolite disposition in rats, the proportion of measured radioactivity attributed to known or unknown SDG metabolites was not determined. Using HPLC and GC-MS, two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of acute (1 d) vs. chronic (10 d) SDG treatment on major urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG in female, Sprague-Dawley rats (70-72-d-old) over a 48-h period and if new urinary metabolites were detectable in rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG. A third experiment was conducted to determine changes in postprandial blood levels of (3)H-SDG metabolites over a 24-h period with acute or chronic SDG treatment. Regardless of treatment, enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol accounted for 75-80% of urine radioactivity. Four potential new lignan metabolites, two of which were detected in the urine of rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG, were found. Type of treatment had no effect on levels of individual urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG. As observed for plasma lignans in women fed flaxseed, blood radioactivity peaked at 9 h and remained high until 24 h in both treatment groups, suggesting that blood lignan kinetics might be similar with flaxseed or SDG consumption and that they were comparable between humans and rats. In conclusion, the main urinary lignan metabolites were enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol. Urinary composition or blood levels of radioactive lignans were not affected by the duration of SDG exposure. Thus, while chronic SDG exposure alters lignan disposition in rats, it does not change the metabolite profile.",1
"Common bean effects on health have been related to its dietary fiber content and other active compounds. This study assessed the content of flavonoids, coumestrol, phenolic acids, galactooligosaccharides, and phytic acid in wild and cultivated Mexican common bean seeds (raw and cooked) and that of flavonoids, coumestrol, and phenolic acids in germinated bean seeds. The presence of isoflavones in raw bean seeds was not confirmed by the UV spectra. Quercetin, kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.",1
"Some blood orange juice (BOJ) flavanones may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hypolipidaemic, vasoprotective and anticarcinogenic properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of hesperetin and naringenin in human subjects after BOJ intake. In a cross-over study, seven healthy female volunteers consumed 150 and 300 ml BOJ corresponding to about 51-102 mg hesperetin and to 6-12 mg naringenin, respectively. Plasma samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after BOJ administration and analysed for their content of hesperetin and naringenin by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. The plasma concentrations of these compounds were dose dependent and the peak concentration (Cmax) was reached in 5.1 (sd 0.6) h after BOJ intake. The Cmax of hesperetin was 43.4 (sd 32.4) and 79.8 (sd 60.1) ng/ml after 150 and 300 ml intake, respectively. For naringenin the plasma peak was 16.4 (sd 11.9) and 34.0 (sd 20.6) ng/ml. Moreover, the conjugated forms of these flavanones represent more than 95 % of the plasma concentration. The results indicate that both hesperetin and naringenin are bioavailable after BOJ intake; naringenin seemingly more so than hesperetin.",1
"Ellagic acid and its derivatives present in pilot-plant-processed raspberry juices and commercial juice concentrates were characterized and concentrations estimated using HPLC/diode array spectral techniques. Experimental juice samples (n = 45) contained a mean concentration of 10 ppm of ellagic acid and less than or equal to 16 derivatives of ellagic acid with individual mean concentrations of up to 3 ppm. Commercial juices (n = 7) contained more ellagic acid and derivatives than experimental juices, with a mean concentration of 30 ppm of ellagic acid and up to 6.7 ppm for individual ellagic acid derivatives. The mean total concentration of ellagic acid and its derivatives in experimental juices was 28 ppm and in commercial juices 52 ppm. Qualitatively, the chromatographic profiles were very similar for the juices studied, but quantitatively, there were great differences due to cultivar (n = 10) and processing method. Williamette and Meeker cultivars contained the most ellagic acid and its forms. Juices made by diffusion extraction and a standard process had by far the highest concentrations of ellagic acid and its forms. High-speed centrifugation reduced total ellagic acid forms by half compared to diffusion extraction; depectinization and concentration decreased total forms even further.",1
"Mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HAs) are formed at low levels during cooking of meat and fish, and some of them are considered to be possible human carcinogens. The formation of HAs may be affected by the presence of synthetic or naturally occurring antioxidants. In the present study the effect of virgin olive oil (VOO) phenolic compounds, identified and quantified by LC-MS, on the formation of HAs in a model system was evaluated. An aqueous solution of creatinine, glucose, and glycine was heated in the presence of two samples of VOO differing only in the composition of phenolic compounds. The addition of VOO to the model system inhibited the formation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) by between 30 and 50% compared with the control. Fresh-made olive oil, which contained a high amount of dihydroxyphenylethanol derivatives, inhibited HA formation more than a 1-year-old oil did. The inhibition of HA formation was also verified using phenolic compounds extracted from VOO.",1
"The variation in the contents of sesamin and sesamolin was studied in oils extracted from 65 samples of sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum L.) from plants with shattering (n=29), semishattering (n=7), and nondehiscent (n=29) capsules. The oil content ranged from 32.5 to 50.6% and was greater in white than black seeds (P<0.001). The sesamin and sesamolin contents in seeds ranged from 7 to 712 mg/100 g (mean±SD, 163±141 mg/100 g) and from 21 to 297 mg/100 g (101±58 mg/100 g), respectively, with no difference between black and white seeds. Thus, there was a wide variation in the contents of sesamin and sesamolin, which were positively correlated (R 2=0.66, P<0.001). There were negative correlations between the contents of sesamin and the contents of sesaminol (R 2=0.37) and sesamolinol (R 2=0.36) and between the content of sesamolin and those of sesaminol (R 2=0.35) and sesamolinol (R 2=0.46) (P<0.001). Sesame seeds had an average of 0.63% lignans, making them a rich source of dietary lignans.",1
"A high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (DAD) procedure separating and quantifying 16 phenolic acids was used for determination of phenolic acids content in dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Dry beans from 10 market classes and 15 varieties that are commonly consumed in the United States were screened for phenolic acids content. Systematic sequential hydrolysis of a model Black bean (Eclipse variety) showed an insignificant amount of free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and water (85:15,%v/v) containing 10% acetic acid. The majority of phenolic acids were extracted from the base hydrolyzed fraction, and further sequential acid hydrolysis of the same extract did not yield any additional amounts of phenolic acid. Therefore all bean samples were ground and hydrolyzed with base in the presence of ascorbic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and the free phenolic acids were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by HPLC. Ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and sinapic acid were detected and quantified in all varieties. However, caffeic acid was detected in measurable amount only in two Black bean varieties (T-39 and Eclipse). The average phenolic acid content of dry bean sample was determined to be 31.2mg/100g. Total phenolic acid content among all samples varied between 19.1 and 48.3mg/100g of bean samples. Ferulic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid present in all samples, whereas intermediate levels of p-coumaric acid and sinapic acid were extracted from all bean samples. Over 83% of the total phenolic acids were retained in bean samples during the cooking process, and only 2% or less were detected in water extracts during overnight soaking.",1
"Raw and treated cowpea, pea and kidney bean seeds were investigated for their content of antinutritional factors including tannins, phytic acid, trypsin inhibitors and oligosaccharides. Treatments applied included water soaking, boiling, roasting, microwave cooking, autoclaving, fermentation and micronization. Kidney bean contained the highest antinutrient content among all investigated seeds. The least tannins and phytic acid contents were recorded in Canadian cowpea while Canadian pea showed the lowest TIA. All treatments conducted caused significant decreases in tannins, phytic acid, TIA and oligosaccharides as compared to the raw seeds. Boiling caused the highest reduction in tannins followed by autoclaving and microwave cooking. Autoclaving and fermentation were the most effective in reducing phytic acid content. Heat treatments (boiling, roasting, microwave cooking and autoclaving) brought a total removal of trypsin inhibitors of all samples. Furthermore, autoclaving caused the highest reduction in oligosaccharides followed by fermentation while the least reductions were caused by either roasting or micronization with no significant difference between these two treatments.",1
"Polyphenols and tannins have implications for health and nutrition. There is limited information on their content in pulses, raw or post-processing. We estimated the concentrations of polyphenols and tannins in different cultivars of four pulses commonly consumed in India – Phaseolus aureus, Cajanus cajan, Lens esculenta and Cicer arietinum – and examined the effects of domestic processing. Means and standard deviations were calculated and results were analyzed by ANOVA. There were significant differences (P<0.001) in the polyphenol and tannin contents of cultivars of the same pulse, with the exception of the tannin contents of pressure-cooked red gram cultivars (P=0.3103). Processing reduced the concentrations of polyphenols by 19–59% and of tannins by 22–59%. A trend was observed in the degree to which processing reduced polyphenol and tannin contents (germination>pressure-cooking>soaking). Soaking, germination and pressure-cooking proved to be effective household strategies to reduce the levels of polyphenols and tannins in pulse-based foods, thereby enhancing the bioavailability of pulse protein. There is a need to determine the extent to which the remaining polyphenols and tannins are rendered unavailable by these processing techniques.",1
"Following the ingestion of green tea, substantial quantities of flavan-3-ols pass from the small to the large intestine (Stalmach et al. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, 53, S44-S53; Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200900194). To investigate the fate of the flavan-3-ols entering the large intestine, where they are subjected to the action of the colonic microflora, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate were incubated in vitro with fecal slurries and the production of phenolic acid catabolites was determined by GC-MS. In addition, urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites was investigated over a 24 h period after ingestion of either green tea or water by healthy volunteers with a functioning colon. The green tea was also fed to ileostomists, and 0-24 h urinary excretion of phenolic acid catabolites was monitored. Pathways are proposed for the degradation of green tea flavan-3-ols in the colon and further catabolism of phenolic compounds passing into the circulatory system from the large intestine, prior to urinary excretion in quantities corresponding to ca. 40% of intake compared with ca. 8% absorption of flavan-3-ol methyl, glucuronide, and sulfate metabolites in the small intestine. The data obtained point to the importance of the colonic microflora in the overall bioavailability and potential bioactivity of dietary flavonoids.",1
"NK-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (NK-LL) is an extremely rare hematopoietic tumor consisting of natural killer (NK) precursor cells, and their lineage overlaps with T-cells, making it challenging to diagnose. COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for people with a risk of aggravation such as cancer-bearing patients, including hematopoietic tumors. We present a 55-year-old man who had cervical lymph node swelling post vaccination for COVID-19. Hematological malignancy was suspected due to the presence of atypical lymphoid cells with an elevated IL-2R in laboratory data. Tumor cells were positive for CD7, CD56, cyCD3, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) evidenced through flow cytometry of the bone marrow and the lymph node. The histopathological findings showed monotonous tumor cell proliferation, the cells being positive for CD3 and TdT in the bone marrow and they were positive for CD3, TdT, and CD56 in lymph node. Even though these findings suggested NK-LL, clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) β gene rearrangement by Southern blot hybridization was observed in the bone marrow. TCRβ rearrangement led to the final diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and carcinogenesis is not clear, and more cases need to be studied in order to elucidate the relationship between the two factors.",0
"Despite improvements in survival for children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (T-ALL/LLy), morbidity remains high. However, data are lacking regarding comprehensive descriptions of clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) experienced during early intensive chemotherapy. This single-institution retrospective study evaluated children aged 1-21 years with T-ALL/T-LLy diagnosed from 2010 to 2020. Physician chart abstraction identified and graded 20 clinically relevant AEs. AE rates were analyzed by T-ALL or LLy, minimal residual disease status, induction steroid, and use of antimicrobial prophylaxis. Statistical comparisons used the Kruskal-Wallis test (continuous variables) and Chi-square or Fisher's exact test (categorical variables). The cohort included 120 patients (T-ALL: 88; T-LLy: 32). Most patients experienced AEs during induction (85 out of 120; 70.8%) and consolidation (89 out of 111; 80.2%). Nonsepsis infection was common in induction (26 out of 120; 21.7%) and consolidation (35 out of 111; 31.5%). Patients treated with dexamethasone during induction had significantly higher rates of nonsepsis infection and/or sepsis during consolidation than those who received prednisone (p < .01). Clinically significant AEs are extremely common during induction and consolidation therapy for patients with T-ALL/LLy. Infectious AEs are particularly prevalent. These results can inform conversations with patients and families and aid in the development of toxicity-related aims in the next generation of, prospective clinical trials in T-ALL/LLy.",0
"The first of a two-part review of the recent and classical literature reveals that loss of nutrients in fresh products during storage and cooking may be more substantial than commonly perceived. Depending on the commodity, freezing and canning processes may preserve nutrient value. The initial thermal treatment of processed products can cause loss of water-soluble and oxygen-labile nutrients such as vitamin C and the B vitamins. However, these nutrients are relatively stable during subsequent canned storage owing to the lack of oxygen. Frozen products lose fewer nutrients initially because of the short heating time in blanching, but they lose more nutrients during storage owing to oxidation. Phenolic compounds are also water-soluble and oxygen-labile, but changes during processing, storage and cooking appear to be highly variable by commodity. Further studies would facilitate the understanding of the changes in these phytochemicals. Changes in moisture content during storage, cooking and processing can misrepresent changes in nutrient content. These findings indicate that exclusive recommendations of fresh produce ignore the nutrient benefits of canned and frozen products. Nutritional comparison would be facilitated if future research would express nutrient data on a dry weight basis to account for changes in moisture. ",1
"The effect of storage and the stage of maturity of hardy kiwifruits on the physicochemical quality, phenolics (TPC) and ascorbic acid content (AAC), as well as antioxidant activity (AA) were studied in this work. The phenolic compounds in hardy kiwifruits were separated and characterized by HPLC. The investigation was carried out on the two cultivars of Actinidia arguta – ‘Weiki’, ‘74-49’ and the hybrid of A. arguta and Actinidia purpurea (‘D14’). Fruit firmness rapidly decreased and the soluble solid content (SSC) increased for all cultivars during the first 14 days of storage at 1°C. The AAC and TPC in vine ripe fruits were similar to the ones of the fruits of storage harvest maturity (8–10% SSC). AA content depended on the clone and either decreased during storage or remained almost unchanged. There was an increase in TPC after 7 days of keeping the fruits in a cold store chamber at the temperature 1°C, but a longer period of storage caused a decrease in these compounds. AA (at harvest for storage purposes) was higher than that of vine ripe fruits and the ability to absorb free radicals slightly decreased during storage. There was a strong correlation between AAC, TPC and AA. That means that phenolics and vitamin C affect the antioxidant activity of hardy kiwifruits.",1
"The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS (4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).",1
"RS4;11 cell line was used to establish BCL-2 inhibitor-resistant cell lines of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and explore the possible mechanisms of drug resistance. RS4;11 cell line was continuously induced and cultured by low and ascending concentrations of BCL-2 inhibitors navitoclax and venetoclax to construct navitoclax-resistant cell line RS4;11/Nav and venetoclax-resistant cell line RS4;11/Ven. The cell viability was detected by MTT assay, and the cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between RS4;11 drug-resistant cell lines and parental cell line were detected by transcriptome sequencing technology (RNA-seq), and mRNA expression levels of DEGs between drug-resistant cell lines and parental cell line were detected by real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of BCL-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins in drug-resistant cell lines and parental cell line. The drug-resistant cell lines RS4;11/Nav and RS4;11/Ven were successfully established. The resistance index (RI) of RS4;11/Nav to navitoclax and RS4;11/Ven to venetoclax was 328.655±47.377 and 2 894.027±300.311, respectively. The results of cell apoptosis detection showed that compared with the drug-resistant cell lines, RS4;11 parental cell line were significantly inhibited by BCL-2 inhibitors, while the apoptosis rate of drug-resistant cell lines was not affected by the drugs. Western blot assay showed that the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of BCL-2 family did not increase significantly in drug-resistant cell lines. RNA-seq, RT-PCR and Western blot assays showed that the expression of EP300 in drug-resistant cell lines was significantly higher than that in parental cell line ( Drug-resistant B-ALL cell lines could be successfully established by exposing RS4;11 cell line to the ascending concentration of BCL-2 inhibitors, and the drug resistance mechanism may be related to the overexpression of EP300. 急性B淋巴细胞白血病BCL-2抑制剂耐药细胞系的构建及耐药机制研究. 利用急性B淋巴细胞白血病（B-ALL）细胞系RS4;11构建对BCL-2抑制剂耐药的耐药细胞系，并探讨其可能的耐药机制。. 采用BCL-2抑制剂navitoclax和venetoclax小剂量低浓度递增的方法间歇诱导RS4;11细胞系，构建RS4;11/Nav和RS4;11/Ven耐药细胞系，通过MTT法检测不同药物浓度下细胞的存活率，流式细胞术检测细胞凋亡，转录组测序技术（RNA-seq）检测RS4;11耐药细胞系和亲本细胞系中的差异表达基因（DEGs），RT-PCR检测耐药细胞系与亲本细胞系中差异表达基因的mRNA表达水平，Western blot检测耐药细胞系和亲本细胞系中BCL-2家族抗凋亡蛋白的表达水平。. 成功构建了对BCL-2抑制剂耐药的耐药细胞系RS4;11/Nav和RS4;11/Ven，RS4;11/Nav对navitoclax的耐药指数为328.655±47.377，RS4;11/Ven对venetoclax的耐药指数为2 894.027±300.311。流式细胞术检测细胞凋亡发现，相比耐药细胞系，RS4;11亲本细胞系明显被BCL-2抑制剂抑制，而耐药细胞系的凋亡率基本未受药物的影响。Western blot检测结果表明，BCL-2家族抗凋亡蛋白在耐药细胞系中的表达无明显增多。RNA-seq、RT-PCR和Western blot检测发现EP300在耐药细胞系中的表达较亲本细胞系明显增高（ 小剂量低浓度递增间歇诱导法可成功构建对BCL-2抑制剂耐药的B-ALL细胞系，并且其耐药机制可能与EP300的表达上调有关。.",0
"Antioxidant components, including phenolics, ascorbic acid and carotenoids, of broccoli floret and stem, antioxidant activity, and their changes during conventional and microwave cooking, were investigated. Broccoli florets and stem were cooked by conventional boiling or by microwave over up to 300 s. Total phenolics were retained by up to 28.1–28.4% in the cooked florets and 55.6–57.8% in the cooked stems, and ascorbic acid by 34.1–34.4% and 29.1–29.5%, respectively. Total carotenoids were retained better compared to total phenolics and ascorbic acid. Total antioxidant activity was retained at 34.7–35.0% in the cooked florets and 34.6–34.7% in the cooked stems and phenolic antioxidant activity was retained at 37.4% and 64.7%, respectively. The results showed that antioxidant components and antioxidant activity in broccoli were lost heavily during the cooking. These losses need to be taken into account when calculating the dietary intake of these compounds from the cooked broccoli.",1
"Breastfeeding has been suggested to protect against childhood cancers, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the evidence stems from case-control studies alone. To investigate whether longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding is associated with decreased risk of childhood ALL and other childhood cancers. This population-based cohort study used administrative data on exclusive breastfeeding duration from the Danish National Child Health Register. All children born in Denmark between January 2005 and December 2018 with available information on duration of exclusive breastfeeding were included. Children were followed up from age 1 year until childhood cancer diagnosis, loss to follow-up or emigration, death, age 15 years, or December 31, 2020. Data were analyzed from March to October 2023. Duration of exclusive breastfeeding in infancy. Associations between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and risk of childhood cancer overall and by subtypes were estimated as adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) with 95% CIs using stratified Cox proportional hazards regression models. A total of 309 473 children were included (51.3% boys). During 1 679 635 person-years of follow-up, 332 children (0.1%) were diagnosed with cancer at ages 1 to 14 years (mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 4.24 [2.67] years; 194 boys [58.4%]). Of these, 124 (37.3%) were diagnosed with hematologic cancers (81 [65.3%] were ALL, 74 [91.4%] of which were B-cell precursor [BCP] ALL), 44 (13.3%) with central nervous system tumors, 80 (24.1%) with solid tumors, and 84 (25.3%) with other and unspecified malignant neoplasms. Compared with exclusive breastfeeding duration of less than 3 months, exclusive breastfeeding for 3 months or longer was associated with a decreased risk of hematologic cancers (AHR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95), which was largely attributable to decreased risk of BCP-ALL (AHR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99), but not with risk of central nervous system tumors (AHR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.51-1.88) or solid tumors (AHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.55-1.41). In this cohort study, longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with reduced risk of childhood BCP-ALL, corroborating results of previous case-control investigations in this field. To inform future preemptive interventions, continued research should focus on the potential biologic mechanisms underlying the observed association.",0
"Industrial processing of tomatoes involves juice addition and heat treatment that may affect (increase or decrease) the levels of phenolic compounds. In this work, we evaluated the effect of each processing step in the paste-making process. Four technological processes were investigated on an industrial scale: Hot Break 28/30, Hot Break 22/24, Cold Break 28/30 and Passata 10/12; and four stages were monitored in each process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) juice after scalders and cream addition; (3) tomato paste from evaporators and (4) final paste. The effect of each processing stage was evaluated by different analyses: first, hydrophilic antioxidant capacity was evaluated using ABTS+ and DPPH assays and total phenolics using Folin–Ciocalteau method; then, individual polyphenols were quantified using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. This multifaceted approach has revealed that each processing stage induces different changes in the antioxidant and phenolic profile. The results of this study indicated that cream addition increases the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity and the amount of phenolic compounds positively, while heat treatment and, to a lesser extent, the sterilization stage during the paste-making process affect these compounds negatively.",1
"A rapid and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS) method is described for the determination and quantification of 12 dietary flavonoid glycosides and aglycons in human urine samples. Chromatographic separation of the analytes of interest was achieved by column-switching, using the first column (a Zorbax 300SB C-3 column) for sample cleanup and eluting the heart-cut flavonoid fraction onto the second column (a Zorbax SB C-18 column) for separation and detection by ultraviolet and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization MS using single ion monitoring in negative mode. The fragmentor voltage was optimized with regard to maximum abundance of the molecular ion and qualifier ions of the analytes. Calibration graphs were prepared for urine, and good linearity was achieved over a dynamic range of 2.5-1000 ng/mL. The inter- and intraassay coefficients of variation for the analysis of the 12 different flavonoids in quality control urine samples were 12.3% on average (range 11.0-13.7%, n = 24, reproducibility) and the repeatability of the assay were 5.0% (mean, range 0.1-14.8%, n = 12). A subset of 10 urine samples from a human dietary intervention study with high and low flavonoid content was analyzed, and the results are reported.",1
"Immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) over the past 2 decades, leading to excellent outcomes in adults and children. This is especially true in the setting of relapsed and refractory (R/R) disease, in which treatment outcomes formerly were dismal. Several immune therapies have shown efficacy and safety in the R/R setting, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. These new immunotherapy approaches have brought about a major paradigm shift in the treatment of R/R ALL, with very few long-term side effects in comparison with standard chemotherapy. These agents are now being used in patients with newly diagnosed ALL, with good response rates. This review discusses novel immunotherapeutic options, including bispecific antibodies, ADCs, and CAR T-cell-based therapies, in the upfront setting. It also discusses the incorporation of novel agents either as monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy and describes our views on how best to use these agents in patients with newly diagnosed disease.",0
"Success of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) mesh procedures also depends on reliable anchoring systems (AS). Our primary aim was to assess the use of soft-embalmed cadavers in testing of different AS and our secondary aim was to compare extraction forces (EF) of different AS and non-absorbable suture (NAS). IRB approval was obtained. NAS (Ti-cron®) and different AS were attached to force-measuring instrument (Dynamometer SS25LA) and anchored to anterior longitudinal (ALL) and pectineal ligament (PL) (Protack®, Uplift®, NAS), and sacrospinous ligament (SSL) (Surelift®, Elevate PC®, NAS) of Thiel soft-embalmed cadavers. EF were measured 2-4 times in each cadaver. Data were compared using non-parametric tests. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Three female cadavers (age 59, 77 and 87) were used. NAS EF were significantly higher than AS EF for ALL and SSL, but not PL. Thiel soft-embalmed cadavers proved to be useful in testing of different AS. Use of soft-embalmed cadavers in testing of different AS is feasible. According to our results, the NAS provides most reliable intra-corporeal fixation. However, significant inter- and intra-subject variability indicates that results may also be dependent on the tissue properties and anchoring procedure. Further testing using soft-embalmed cadavers could help optimise mesh procedures and establish a threshold EF necessary for reliable fixation.",0
"Anthocyanin composition was determined in 15 cultivars of black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in México. The studied genotypes included: five cultivars of the Jalisco race, five cultivars of the Mesoamérica race and five recombinant cultivars. Total content of anthocyanins (TCAN) in whole seed and seed coat was performed by a spectrophotometric method; anthocyanin composition by profiles were determined by high performance liquid cromatography (HPLC). TCAN in whole seed and seed coat were different among races and cultivars (p≤0.01). The content of this variable in the seed coat of black beans varieties ranged between 10.1 an 18.1 mg g-1 seed coat; this value was high in the Negro Jamapa variety (Mesoamérica race) and Negro Altiplano recombinant variety (18.1 an 17.3 mg g-1 seed coat). In whole grain, the content of anthocyanin ranged between 37.7 and 71.6 mg g-1 grain. The cultivars from the Mesoamérica race (opaque black seed coat) showed the highest TCAN in whole seed and seed coat. Independently of racial origen, the following were identified as anthocyanins in seed coats of beans: delphinidin 3-glucoside 65.7%, petunidin 3-glucoside 24.3% and maldivin 3 glucoside 8.7%. The varieties Veracruz and Jamapa (mesoamérica race) showed an additional unidentified anthocyanin. The obtained results indicate that black bean cultivars are an important source of anthocyanins and could be used as natural antioxidants, because they are mainly non-acylated anthocyanins.",1
"The association of ALL and KF injuries in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-deficient knees remain topics of conflicting research despite improved magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to evaluate the rate of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) and Kaplan fibers (KF) injuries in adults with acute ACL injuries using MRI. We retrospectively reviewed 64 patients with clinical and MRI diagnoses of acute ACL tears. Two radiologists analyzed and categorized the status of the ALL and KF in all patients as intact, partially injured, or completely injured. Interobserver agreement was assessed. Injuries to the collateral ligaments, ITB and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) were also evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 33 years. ALL injuries were observed in 46 (71%) patients, among whom 33 (71%) had partial and 13 (28%) had complete injuries. KF injuries were identified in 32 (50%) patients, with 28 (87.5%) of them having partial and 4 (12.5%) having complete injuries. Combined injuries of both ALL and KF were found in 25 (32.4%) patients ( ALL and KF injuries were prevalent in acute ACL-injured knees with rates of injury of 71% and 50%, respectively. ALL injuries were more frequent and more frequently severe compared to KF injuries.",0

All the pea varieties differed significantly (p < 0.05) in their phytic acid content. The field pea cultivars had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of phytic acid and polyphenols than those of vegetable pea varieties. All the domestic processing and cooking methods could reduce the contents of phytic acid and polyphenols but germination for 48 hours seemed to have a marked lowering effect on the levels of these antinutrients in peas.,1
"A screening method using LC-DAD-ESI/MS was applied to the analysis of flavonoids in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seeds (Apium graveolens L. and varieties). Fifteen flavonoid glycosides were detected in the three celery materials. They were identified as luteolin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-glucoside, and more than 10 malonyl derivatives of these glycosides. The identification of the malonyl derivatives was confirmed by their conversion into glycosides upon heating and by comparison of some of the malonates with malonates that had previously been identified in red bell pepper and parsley. The concentrations of the glycosides and the malonyl glycosides in the three materials were estimated by comparison to aglycone standards. This is the first report of the presence of these glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery.",1
"Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, respectively.",1
"Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represent a distinct population with variable outcomes. This study assessed the real-world efficacy and safety of the AYA-15 protocol in this group. A retrospective cohort of 149 AYA patients (median age: 18 years) treated with the AYA-15 protocol at a tertiary care center in the middle east was analyzed. Baseline characteristics, measurable residual disease (MRD) kinetics, toxicity profiles, and survival outcomes were examined. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify adverse prognostic factors. Among the 149 patients, 74% had B-cell ALL and 10% had central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Day 28 MRD negativity was achieved in 76% of patients, increasing to 88% post-consolidation. The 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival (EFS) rates were 79%, 68%, and 59%, respectively. The most common grade ≥3 toxicities included febrile neutropenia, infections, hepatotoxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions to PEG-asparaginase. Multivariable analysis identified CNS involvement, post-consolidation MRD positivity, and elevated BMI as independent predictors of inferior outcomes. The AYA-15 protocol demonstrated favorable survival and MRD response rates in a real-world cohort of Philadelphia-negative AYA ALL patients. Certain baseline and treatment-related factors were associated with poorer outcomes, highlighting the importance of individualized risk stratification.",0
"A new lignan glucoside was isolated from defatted sesame seed flour and its structure was established as sesamolinol diglucoside [2-(3-methoxy-4-(O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl (1-->6)-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside)phenoxyl)-6-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-cis-3,7-dioxabicyclo-(3.3.0)-octane] by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A quantitative analysis of 65 sesame seed samples showed that this sesamolinol diglucoside ranged from <5 to 232 mg/100 g of seeds (98+/-57 mg/100 g) with no difference between white and black sesame seeds.",1
"We present the case of a 14-year-old boy with history of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), multiple polymicrobial infections, and recent pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis who was incidentally found to have a submitral left ventricular aneurysm. Concurrently, he developed a relapse of his B-cell ALL as demonstrated by the presence of lymphoblasts in his cerebrospinal fluid. The decision was made to proceed with surgical repair of the aneurysm prior to initiation of systemic chemotherapy. The patient underwent a successful repair of the aneurysm through repair of the mitral valve annular disruption. The aneurysm is likely to be due to partially treated endocarditis, weakening the mitral valve atrioventricular junction, resulting in dehiscence. Recovery post-operatively was uneventful and he was able to undergo CAR-T cell therapy several months later.",0
"This study evaluates the outcomes and risk factors associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in adolescents and young adults (AYA) diagnosed with early T-precursor (ETP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) compared to non-ETP ALL.We retrospectively analyzed 178 AYA patients with T-ALL who were treated between September 2014 and December 2022. Out of 178 patients, 128 underwent allo-HSCT, with a median age of 25 years (range: 18-35). Among them, 49 were in the ETP group and 79 in the non-ETP group. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment times were comparable between groups. 3-year OS rates were 67.3% for ETP and 65.8% for non-ETP patients; 3-year LFS rates were 65.3% and 65.8%, respectively, showing no significant difference. Cumulative incidence of relapse (22.1% vs. 21.6%) and non-relapse mortality rates (17.8% vs. 13.7%) were similar. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, along with infections, showed no significant differences. Multivariable analysis revealed first complete remission before transplantation as a positive predictor for OS and LFS in non-ETP patients. In ETP patients, a white blood cell count below 30 × 10",0
"The risk of cancer among relatives of patients with either myelodysplastic neoplasia (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has not been thoroughly examined. We linked the Danish Civil Registration System with the Danish Cancer Registry, the Danish National Acute Leukemia Registry, and the Danish Myelodysplastic Syndrome Database to estimate the relative risk of cancer among relatives of patients with MDS/AML/ALL. We used standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), i.e., the ratio of observed to expected number of cancers among the relatives as a measure of relative risk. We identified 13010 first-degree (FDR) and 22051 second-degree (SDR) relatives of 8386 patients with MDS/ALL/AML. Disregarding basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the relative risk for cancer overall was increased in both FDR (SIR=1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.4) and SDR (SIR=1.5; 95% CI 1.2-1.8). SIRs among FDRs were statistically significantly increased for malignant melanoma, BCC and for the combined groups of cancers of the male genital organs, urinary tract, and MDS/AML/ALL. Among SDRs, SIRs were statistically significantly increased for malignant melanoma, BCC, and cancers in the digestive organs and peritoneum. We observed an increased risk of cancer among FDR and SDR of patients with MDS/AML/ALL.",0
"The effect of storage on the total polyphenol content and individual phenolic compounds as well as on the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity of ketchups and tomato juices was studied. The total polyphenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction was determined using DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. Individual polyphenols were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole. All analyses were carried out for ketchups and tomato juices after storage for 3, 6, and 9 months. The total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction decreased during storage of ketchups and tomato juices. Ketchups, in general, showed a slightly greater stability during storage than tomato juices. The most significant decrease was observed for quercetin followed by caffeic and ferulic acids, whereas glycosilated polyphenols showed greater stability during storage.",1
"This study aimed to characterize the non-central nervous system extramedullary disease (non-CNS EMD) in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL) and to evaluate the prognostic value of metabolic parameters derived from [ Patients with r/r B-ALL who received chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and underwent [ A total of 81 B-ALL patients were included in this study. The most frequently observed non-CNS EMD lesions involved the lymph node, spleen, and kidney. After a median follow-up time of 23.7 months, multivariate analysis identified hemoglobin (Hb) and SUVmax (with a cut-off value of 7.0) as independent prognostic factors for PFS and OS. Patients with abnormal Hb levels exhibited significantly shorter PFS and OS compared to those with normal Hb levels (median PFS: 13.5 months vs. not reached, P = 0.004; median OS: 48.0 months vs. not reached, P = 0.010). Similarly, patients with SUVmax above the threshold had significantly reduced PFS and OS compared to those below the threshold (median PFS: 9.1 months vs. not reached, P ≤ 0.001; median OS: 27.0 months vs. 50.8 months, P = 0.020).

"Recent studies indicate that anthocyanin intake conveys a variety of health benefits, which depend on absorption and metabolic mechanisms that deliver anthocyanins and their bioactive metabolites to responsive tissues. The anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red cabbage (containing 1.38 micromol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated and methylated anthocyanins. The results show that red cabbage anthocyanins were excreted in both intact and metabolized forms and that recovery of nonacylated anthocyanins in urine was >4-fold that of acylated anthocyanins.",1
"Ascorbic acid, total polyphenols, anthocyanins, antioxidant capacity (TEAC), soluble solids, titratable acidity and fruit colour (L*, chroma and hue angle) were quantified (a) in ripe fruit of four raspberry cultivars and (b) in fruit of different commercial ripening stages (semi-ripe, ripe and slightly over-ripe defined by CIE L*a*b* measurements) of cv. Tulameen. Fruit were also stored 1d at 20°C room temperature or 3d at 2–4°C followed by 1d at room temperature. All measured parameters including the ratios between cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside were strongly influenced by genotype. Enhanced fruit ripening was reflected by decreased values for titratable acidity, colour parameters and increased concentration of total anthocyanins. After storage, berry colour was darker and fruit considerably lost weight, while total anthocyanins and TEAC were higher in comparison to fresh fruit in both experiments. Soluble solids and total phenols only increased in fruit of different ripening stages of cv. Tulameen but not in the stored ripe fruit of the four cultivars. Titratable acidity, ascorbic acid and the ratio between the individual anthocyanins remained nearly unchanged during the storage period.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia from early T-cell progenitors. Interest grows in creating less toxic agents and therapies for chemo-resistant T-ALL cancer. Recently, elemental boron has special properties useful in the creation of new drugs. Studies have revealed the cytotoxic properties of boric acid (BA) on cancer, but not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the effect of BA on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress in the Jurkat cells. The effects of BA on cell viability were determined by 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay for 24-48-72 h. The impact of BA on apoptosis was analyzed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide. Expression of apoptosis regulatory genes (Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3-8-9) and apoptotic miRNA (miR-21) was used by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and the oxidative stress index (OSI) value were calculated for oxidative stress.

"Diosmetin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) is the aglycone of the flavonoid glycoside diosmin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone-7-ramnoglucoside). Diosmin is hydrolyzed by enzymes of intestinal micro flora before absorption of its aglycone diosmetin. A specific, sensitive, precise, accurate and robust HPLC assay for the simultaneous determination of diosmin and diosmetin in human plasma was developed and validated. Plasma samples were incubated with beta-glucuronidase/sulphatase. The analytes were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether at pH 2, and separated on a C(18) reversed-phase column using a mixture of methanol/1% formic acid (58:42, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. APCI in the positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was employed. The selected transitions for diosmin, diosmetin and the internal standard (7-ethoxycoumarin) at m/z were: 609.0-->463.0, 301.2-->286.1 and 191, respectively. A good linearity was found in the range of 0.25-500ng/ml (R(2)>0.992) for both compounds. The intra-batch assay precision (CV) for diosmin and diosmetin ranged from 1.5% to 11.2% and from 2.8% to 12.5%, respectively, and the inter-batch precision were from 5.2% to 11.5% and 8.5% to 9.8%, respectively. The accuracy was well within the acceptable range the accuracies (from -2.7% to 4.2% and -1.6% to 3.5% for diosmin and diosmetin, respectively). The mean recoveries of diosmin, diosmetin and the internal standard were 87.5%, 89.2% and 67.2%. Stability studies showed that diosmin and diosmetin were stable in different conditions. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of diosmin in healthy volunteers following a single oral administration (Daflon).",1

"The outcomes of relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) resistant to new drugs such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) and blinatumomab are dismal. We treated two cases of Ph+ALL resistant to these drugs that achieved long-term survival after treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy or a second allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) with a sequential conditioning regimen. Case 1: A 15-year-old boy was diagnosed with Ph+ALL. Despite the second HCT after the treatment of ponatinib and blinatumomab, hematological relapse occurred. InO was ineffective and he was transferred to a CAR-T center. After the CAR-T cell therapy, negative measurable residual disease (MRD) was achieved and maintained for 38 months without maintenance therapy. Case 2: A 21-year-old man was diagnosed with Ph+ALL. Hematological relapse occurred after the first HCT. Despite of the treatment with InO, ponatinib, and blinatumomab, hematological remission was not achieved. The second HCT was performed using a sequential conditioning regimen with clofarabine. Negative MRD was subsequently achieved and maintained for 42 months without maintenance therapy. These strategies are suggestive and helpful to treat Ph+ALL resistant to multiple immunotherapies.",0
"The volatile fraction of commercial cocoa powders was isolated using thin-layer high-vacuum distillation (TLHVD) of Soxhlet extracts. Calculated and experimental recovery of the internal standard n-undecanoic acid methylester did agree, and a good reproducibility was found for the procedure. Around 70 volatile compounds were identified and semi-quantified using internal standard-based gas chromatography (GC), coupled GC–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and GC-olfactometry (GC-O). Dehydromevalonic acid lactone, (R)-(−)-pantolactone and two diastereomer solerols were identified for the first time after purification by micropreparative GC and re-analysis using GC–MS and chiral GC. Strong sensory contributions also came from acetic acid, 2/3-methyl butanoic acid, phenylacetaldehyde, furaneol, dihydroxymaltol, vanillin and phenylacetic acid.",1
"The antioxidant capacities (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic contents in extracts of 27 culinary herbs and 12 medicinal herbs were determined. The ORAC values and total phenolic contents for the medicinal herbs ranged from 1.88 to 22.30 μmol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh weight and 0.23 to 2.85 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of fresh weight, respectively. Origanum × majoricum, O. vulgare ssp. hirtum, and Poliomintha longiflora have higher ORAC and phenolic contents as compared to other culinary herbs. The ORAC values and total phenolic content for the culinary herbs ranged from 2.35 to 92.18 μmol of TE/g of fresh weight and 0.26 to 17.51 mg of GAE/g of fresh weight, respectively. These also were much higher than values found in the medicinal herbs. The medicinal herbs with the highest ORAC values were Catharanthus roseus, Thymus vulgaris, Hypericum perforatum, and Artemisia annua. A linear relationship existed between ORAC values and total phenolic contents of the medicinal herbs (R = 0.919) and culinary herbs (R = 0.986). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diode-array detection was used to identify and quantify the phenolic compounds in selected herbs. Among the identified phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid was the predominant phenolic compound in Salvia officinalis, Thymus vulgaris,Origanum × majoricum, and P. longiflora, whereas quercetin-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 → 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 → 6)-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 → 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 → 6)-glucoside were predominant phenolic compounds in Ginkgo biloba leaves.",1
"MRD measurement is based on the ability to detect a minimal quantity of tumor cells within a population of healthy cells. Given the low sensitivity of cytology, flow cytometry in T-ALL allows the distinction between normal cells and leukemic cells and classifies patients according to their prognosis. The aim of this study was to define the immunophenotypic features of T-ALL at different stages of differentiation in terms of minimal residual disease. This is a prospective study carried out in the Hematology Laboratory of the IBN ROCHD University Hospital in Casablanca Morocco over a period of 3 years and 4 months from September 1, 2020, to December 31, 2023. All patients were included. Pediatric ALL patients, ranging from 1 month- to 15-years old, whose cytological bone marrow remission was confirmed by myelogram at the different phases of treatment: end of induction and end of consolidation, were diagnosed according to the EGIL and WHO - HAEM classifications and followed up in the Pediatric Oncohematology Department. Immunophenotyping was carried out by a Navios Beck Man Coulter 6-color cytometer and 2 lasers equipped with CXP software on bone marrow samples with a panel of 3 tubes: 1-CD5CD7CD3CD10CD3s CD45/2-CD4CD8CD99CD3sCD10CD45/3-CD2CD1CD99CD3CD10CD45; thus, the technical validation consisted of the adjustment of the PMT, determination of the optimal concentrations of the antibodies, establishing the AC panel on normal marrows, the study of the sensitivity and linearity of the technique, and the evaluation of the representativeness of the samples by calculating hemodilution according to Brooimans law. Twenty-five patients were found to be in complete cytological remission, and the analysis of minimum residual disease (MRD) post-induction showed a significant difference (p = 0.0020). Among those with MRD levels less than 10 - 3, none were ETP (0.0%), while 3 (25.0%) were near-ETP and 9 (75.0%) were non-ETP, totaling 12 patients. For those with MRD levels above or equal to 10 - 3, 8 (61.5%) were ETP, 3 (23.1%) were near-ETP, and 2 (15.4%) were non-ETP, totaling 13 patients. Similarly, MRD levels post-consolidation also indicate a significant difference (p = 0.0020), mirroring the results from the post-induction analysis. Our study panel was close to that proposed by a Brazilian study by Roshal et al. [43] and the American study by Wood et al. [44] and was the first large one that describes the immunophenotypic profile of minimal residual disease in T-ALL patients. We concluded that cytometry proves to be a good complement to molecular biology, because it makes it possible to monitor patients who do not have molecular biology monitoring markers. Its limit remains a lower sensitivity than that obtained with molecular biology. If a sensitivity of 10 - 3 is desired, CMF is sufficient for MRD.",0
"A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with column-switching and diode array detection was developed for the determination of the flavonoids isoquercitrin, kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin, quercitrin, and rutin in three Finnish berry wines. Flavone was chosen as internal standard. Filtering was the only sample preparation before injection. The method was applied to the determination of the flavonoid profiles of wines made from black currants, blueberries, and crowberries. Myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were found in all three wines. In addition, the black currant wine contained considerable amounts of rutin and isoquercitrin. The repeatability of the relative retention times was good (RSD ≤ 0.5%). Detection limits were ≤ 60 ng/mL.",1
"Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is used in traditional medicine, as a culinary herb and a well-known source of flavouring principles. Total antioxidant activity in 23 Iranian basil accessions was determined as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Total phenolic contents were determined using a spectrophotometric technique, based on the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, according to the method of Spanos and Wrolstad [Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry, 38 (1990) 1565] and calculated as gallic acid equivalents GAE/g dw. Total antioxidant activity varied from 10.8 to 35.7 μM Trolox, and total phenolic content ranged from 22.9 to 65.5 mg gallic acid/g dw in “Dezful I” and “Babol” accessions, respectively. A linear positive relationship existed between the antioxidant activity and total phenolic acids content of the tested basil accessions (R2=0.71). Iranian basils possess valuable antioxidant properties for culinary and possible medicinal use.",1
"Knowledge of young-onset Alzheimer disease in adults with Down syndrome has greatly improved clinical care. However, little is known about dementia in rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorders (RGNDs). In this review, a comprehensive overview is provided of reports on dementia and cognitive/adaptive trajectories in adults with RGNDs. A systematic literature review was conducted in Embase, Medline ALL, and PsycINFO on December 6, 2022. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021223041). Search terms for dementia, cognitive and adaptive functioning, and RGNDs were combined using generic terms and the Orphanet database. Study characteristics and descriptive data on genetic diagnosis, clinical and neuropathologic features, comorbidities, and diagnostic methods were extracted using a modified version of the Cochrane Data Extraction Template. The literature search yielded 40 publications (17 cohorts, 23 case studies) describing dementia and/or cognitive or adaptive trajectories in adults with 14 different RGNDs. Dementia was reported in 49 individuals (5 cohorts, 20 cases) with a mean age at onset of 44.4 years. Diagnostics were not disclosed for half of the reported individuals (n = 25/49, 51.0%). A total of 44 different psychodiagnostic instruments were used. MRI was the most reported additional investigation (n = 12/49, 24.5%). Comorbid disorders most frequently associated with cognitive/adaptive decline were epilepsy, psychotic disorders, and movement disorders. Currently available literature shows limited information on aging in RGNDs, with relatively many reports of young-onset dementia. Longitudinal data may provide insights into converging neurodevelopmental degenerative pathways. We provide recommendations to optimize dementia screening, diagnosis, and research.",0
"Cultural system [hill plasticulture (HC) versus matted row (MR)] and genotype interactions affected strawberry fruit quality. In general, fruit soluble solids content, total sugar, fructose, glucose, ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and citric acid contents were increased in the HC system. Fruit from HC also had higher flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. Strawberry fruit contains flavonols as well as other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolic acids. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate were the predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. The content of cyanidin-based anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in either system. Strawberry fruit from the HC system had significantly higher amounts of p-coumaroylglucose, dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate. Fruits from plants grown in the MR system generally had the lowest contents of phenolic acids, flavonols, and anthocyanins. Strawberry fruit grown under HC conditions had significantly higher peroxyl radicals (ROO*) absorbance capacity (ORAC).",1
"Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL), mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL), and acute myeloid leukemia with minimal differentiation (AML-M0) all originate from immature hematopoietic progenitor cells and have a poor prognosis. We investigated the clinical characteristics of these immature leukemias in 17 children (ETP-ALL: 8, MPAL: 5, AML-M0: 4) at seven institutions. Clinical and laboratory findings were comparable across disease types. Eleven and six patients received ALL- and AML-oriented induction chemotherapy, with six and four achieving complete remission (CR), respectively. Five additional patients achieved CR after salvage with the other type of chemotherapy. Eight patients received hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first CR, and six survived without relapse. However, six of seven patients who did not receive HCT during first CR relapsed; all underwent HCT later, and only three survived. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rate were 37% and 69%, respectively. Patients who achieved CR after induction chemotherapy and received HCT in first CR had favorable EFS and OS. Notably, all patients who received HCT in first CR survived 5 years after diagnosis. Appropriate induction chemotherapy and HCT in first CR could improve the outcome of immature leukemias.",0
"This article reports an acoustic Luneburg lens (ALL) design with graded refractive index for passive directivity detection of acoustic sources. The refractive index profile of the lens is realized based on square pillars with graded variation of their dimensions. Numerical and experimental studies are conducted to investigate the performance of directivity detection. The results demonstrate that the lens designed and developed in this study is capable of precisely detecting the directivity of one acoustic source. Furthermore, the directivities of two acoustic sources can also be detected with a resolution of 15°. In addition, different methods are investigated, including introducing phase difference by tuning input signals or moving ALL, and increasing the aperture size of ALL, to improve the resolution of dual sources directivity detection.",0
"Relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is an aggressive B-cell neoplasm associated with poor outcomes. Conventional multiagent chemotherapy and bispecific antibody therapy may induce remission; however, relapse rates remain high and overall survival is poor. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy provides durable, deep complete remission, and long-term cures in relapsed and refractory B-ALL. However, with this new treatment modality, 10%-30% of patients do not achieve remission, and over 50% experience relapse after therapy. Currently, there are two approved CD19-specific CAR-T cell constructs in B-ALL, Tisagenlecleucel and Brexucabtagene Autoleucel by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In this review, we discuss patients, disease, and CAR-T predictors of outcomes in B-ALL. We describe the two approved CD19-directed CAR-T cell products, review the current literature, and discuss factors associated with high risks of therapy failure and future direction in CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy caused by the accumulation of genomic lesions that affect the development of T cells. Notch1 signaling controls the expression of numerous T-lineage genes, thus playing essential parts in T-cell differentiation. T-ALL can be classified into two subtypes according to the immunophenotypic and genetic makeup: early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) and non-ETP-ALL. The relationship between constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling and non-ETP-ALL has been thoroughly studied; however, how Notch1 signaling influences ETP-ALL remains unclear. Targeting Notch1 signaling is a promising treatment for T-ALL, and γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), which prevent Notch1 signaling from being activated, show a degree of antineoplastic activity in previous clinical development. But these agents just have satisfactory effects in non-ETP-ALL; further study should be carried out to investigate fitting targeting drugs.",0
"Stoichiometric and kinetic values of phenolics against DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) were determined for Andean purple corn (Zea mays L.) and red sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas). Both crops had higher antioxidant capacity and antiradical kinetics than blueberries and higher or similar anthocyanin and phenolic contents. The second-order rate constant (k(2)) was 1.56, 1.12, 0.57, and 0.26 (mg antiradical/mL)(-1) s(-1) for red sweetpotato, Trolox, purple corn, and blueberry, respectively. On the molar basis of active hydroxyl groups, k(2)' showed the same order as for k(2). Corn cob and sweetpotato endodermis contributed the most in phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity. Both crops studied can be considered as excellent novel sources of natural antioxidants for the functional food and dietary supplement markets.",1
"High-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection has been used for the separation and quantitation of phenolics from fresh and processed green beans. Whole beans, pods and seeds of green beans were studied separately. Chromatographic profiles from pods were more complex than those found in seeds. Flavonol glycosides were confined to quercetin and kaempferol classes and they were typical of external parts of the fruit. Flavan-3-ols monomers ((+) catechin and (−) epicatechin) as well as procyanidins structures were identified in pods and seeds. Chromatographic profiles from processed beans revealed a polyphenolic composition similar to those found in pod fresh green beans. The chromatographic method was carefully validated in regard to precision and accuracy. High reproducibility of peak area (RSD<3%) and calibration slopes (RSD<4%) was obtained. Recoveries between 94–104% revealed good accuracy for the overall method. Application to quantitative determination in a representative number of samples allowed good knowledge of the phenolic composition of green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris v.vulgaris).",1
"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) require reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eliminate pathogens by inducing oxidative stress. However, this process can also cause tissue damage to the host. Neutrophils contain high concentrations of vitamin C (1.5 mM) compared to the bloodstream (0.1 mM), and this antioxidant can interact with vitamin E and glutathione (GSH) inside the cell to maintain the redox balance. Previous studies have investigated the effect of vitamins E or C and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on NET formation, but the interactions of these molecules in neutrophils remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of antioxidants alone and two combinations on NET formation and oxidative stress. Neutrophils were pre-loaded with GSH + NAC or vitamin E + vitamin C + GSH + NAC (termed ALL), and LPS-induced NET formation was assessed using fluorometry and immunofluorescence. Antioxidant effects were evaluated by measuring the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), GSH/GSSG ratio, ROS production, nitrite + nitrate levels, and lipid peroxidation. Our results showed that even low doses of antioxidants are capable of decreasing NETs. Furthermore, the combinations augmented TAC and GSH/GSSG ratio and decreased ROS, nitrites + nitrates, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in supplemented neutrophils in vitro.",0
"Pickler, MC, Gallucci, AR, Lee, KM, Bolden, LK, Rash, ER, and Tinsley, GM. Body composition changes in NCAA Division I female soccer players throughout collegiate playing career. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-Body composition changes commonly occur in athletes because of fluctuations in nutrition, training regimens, and overall health. Although some studies have examined body composition changes across seasons or positions in collegiate athletes, few have analyzed these changes during the course of an entire collegiate playing career. This study addresses this knowledge gap through the analysis of body composition changes in NCAA Division I female soccer players during the course of their collegiate career. Three to 4 total body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were performed on athletes each year from 2010 to 2022, and analyses of body composition changes were conducted using linear mixed-effects models in all athletes with >2 individual scans (ALL analysis; n = 115-116) and in those with ≥3 years of scans (3Y analysis; n = 33-34). Statistical significance was accepted at p ≤ 0.05. In both analyses, athletes experienced significant increases in body mass, lean soft tissue, fat-free mass, fat-free mass index, and spine bone mineral density. In the ALL analysis only, decreases in body fat percentage and increases in total bone mineral density were observed. In addition, goalkeepers had higher body mass and fat mass than those in other positions in the ALL analysis, but the 3Y analysis yielded no statistically significant differences between player positions. In conclusion, active participation in NCAA Division I women's soccer resulted in increased total lean soft tissue, fat-free mass, and bone mineral density of the spine, with participation ≥3 years additionally reducing body fat percentage and increasing total bone mineral density.",0
"Piceatannol (trans-3,3',4,5'-tetrahydroxy-stilbene) is a natural stilbene occurring in a number of plant species, and it has been shown to have beneficial effects on human health. The compound can seldom be consumed by humans, because it occurs in non-food plants, or in non-edible or-gans. Here we show for the first time that grapes (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) have significant amounts of piceatannol (0.052 mg g -1 fresh wt). The identity of piceatannol was confirmed by HPLC and LC-MS.",1
"The daily intake of total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidants in the American diet was estimated from the most common 34 fresh fruit and vegetables and their daily consumption data. Among 14 fruit and 20 vegetables, orange contributed the highest amount of total phenolics [117.1 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) person−1 day−1] and antioxidants [146.6 mg vitamin C equivalents (VCE) person−1 day−1]. Orange contributed about 26 and 25% of total phenolics and antioxidant, respectively, in the daily consumption of fruit and vegetables. Apples showed relatively high levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity comparable to those of oranges and their phenolics and antioxidants contribution is the second highest. Even though potatoes had lower levels of phenolics and antioxidant capacity, they were third due to the fact that their consumption is the highest (137.9 lb person−1 year−1) in the American diet. Although plums and strawberries were ranked as the group with the highest total phenolics and antioxidant capacity among 34 tested fruit and vegetables, their contributions were relatively low due to their lower daily consumption. Generally, the levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity of fruits were higher than those of vegetables. American daily intake of phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidants from fruits and vegetables was estimated to be 450 mg GAE, 103 mg catechin equivalents and 591 mg VCE, respectively. Although we do not yet know the required minimum daily amounts of antioxidants, when we estimate the daily requirement of antioxidants, we must consider not only the antioxidant concentrations of the particular food, but also the daily intakes of the food.",1
"Consumers' increasing interest in the relationship between diet and health is a sign for food producers to pay more attention to potential health-protecting compounds in new product development and food processing. From a production chain perspective the choice of the raw material that is used is important for the health-protecting potential of the end product. Four apple cultivars (Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Cox's Orange, and Elstar), which can be used as fresh apples or in processed apple products, were compared with regard to flavonol, catechins, phloridzin, and chlorogenic acid concentrations and antioxidant activity. Jonagold apples possessed the highest flavonoid concentration and the highest antioxidant activity. To study seasonal differences, apples from three different harvest years were analyzed, but in three cultivars no effect on flavonoid concentration and antioxidant activity was observed. Long-term storage, both at refrigerator temperature and under controlled atmosphere conditions, was found not to influence flavonoid concentration or antioxidant activity.",1

"The clarification of etiopathology, the improvement of chemotherapy regimens and their risk stratifications, and the improvement in treatment support have increased the survival of children and adolescents affected by Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) past few years. This study aimed to estimate overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in an onco-hematology treatment center in Brazil, reports the main clinical-laboratory characteristics of patients at diagnosis, verify the frequency of treatment-related adverse effects and the main causes of death. Retrospective analysis involving patients diagnosed with ALL, treated with the protocol of the Brazilian Group for Treatment of Leukemias in Childhood (GBTLI), between 2010 and 2020 was carried out; the outcomes (relapse, deaths, development of new neoplasms) were analyzed SPSS® software was used for the statistical analyses, and the 109 patients were included in the study; the median age was 5 years, with a slight predominance of males. Sixty-six patients were classified as high-risk (HR) group and 43 patients were classified as low-risk (LR) group. After 5 years of diagnosis, the OS was 71.5%, and the EFS was 65%. No statistical difference was found between the HR and LR groups for OS and EFS, while leukocyte counts were statistically associated with the outcome of death ( The rates of OS and EFS obtained in this cohort are similar to those obtained in the few previous similar studies in Brazil and lower than those carried out in developed countries. The unavailability of prognostic tests may have hindered risk stratification and influenced the results obtained.",0
"The amounts of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol aglycons in 25 edible berries were analyzed by an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV detection and identified with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry detection. Sixteen species of cultivated berries and nine species of wild berries were collected in Finland in 1997. Quercetin was found in all berries, the contents being highest in bog whortleberry (158 mg/kg, fresh weight), lingonberry (74 and 146 mg/kg), cranberry (83 and 121 mg/kg), chokeberry (89 mg/kg), sweet rowan (85 mg/kg), rowanberry (63 mg/kg), sea buckthorn berry (62 mg/kg), and crowberry (53 and 56 mg/kg). Amounts between 14 and 142 mg/kg of myricetin were detected in cranberry, black currant, crowberry, bog whortleberry, blueberries, and bilberry. Kaempferol was detected only in gooseberries (16 and 19 mg/kg) and strawberries (5 and 8 mg/kg). Total contents of these flavonols (100-263 mg/kg) in cranberry, bog whortleberry, lingonberry, black currant, and crowberry were higher than those in the commonly consumed fruits or vegetables, except for onion, kale, and broccoli.",1
"Many effective new agents for relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are now becoming available, and international standard chemotherapy should be developed to optimize use of these agents. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to establish a standard treatment, but few have been conducted for relapsed childhood ALL in Japan due to the small patient population. Participation in international RCTs is necessary to access sufficient patients for informative study results, but differences in approved drugs and healthcare systems between countries make this challenging. In 2014, the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group (JPLSG) participated in an international study on standard-risk relapsed childhood ALL (IntReALL SR 2010) involving two RCTs and multiple drugs not approved in Japan, which was addressed by replacing the unapproved drugs with alternative approved drugs with the same or similar efficacy. This article discusses the historical background of treatment development for relapsed childhood ALL, our experience in participating in the IntReALL SR 2010 trial, and prospects for treating relapsed childhood ALL.",0
"For the quantitative determination of individual flavonoid glycosides in plant materials, the glycosides are normally hydrolysed and the resulting aglycones are identified and quantified. However, the hydrolysis conditions which result in optimal breakdown of glycosides are too harsh for some of the other phenolic compounds present in the same plant material. Therefore, the effects of different hydrolysis conditions and different antioxidants on pure flavonoid glycones and aglycones were studied. On the basis of the results obtained with standards, suitable hydrolysis methods for red spring onion and spinach were developed. The best results from these vegetables were obtained by refluxing at 80 °C for 2 h with 1.2 M HCl in 50% aqueous methanol with addition of 2 mg ascorbic acid as an antioxidant. The method developed in this study is suited to the screening of flavonoids in vegetables and leafy vegetables.",1
"Cytomegalovirus reactivation (CMVR) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a frequent complication related to survival outcomes; however, its impact on relapse remains unclear, especially in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this nationwide retrospective study, we included patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ALL in the first or second complete remission who underwent their first HCT using a pre-emptive strategy for CMVR. Because 90% of cases with CMVR had occurred by day 64 and 90% of cases with grades 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) had occurred by day 58, a landmark point was set at day 65. In landmark analyses, 3793 patients with AML and 2213 patients with ALL who survived without relapse for at least 65 days were analyzed. Multivariate analyses showed that CMVR was associated with a lower incidence of relapse in both AML (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.95; P = .009) and ALL (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99; P = .045). These findings were confirmed when CMVR was used as the time-dependent covariate. Moreover, our study suggests that the protective effect of CMVR on relapse was independent of acute GVHD. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of combined AML and ALL showed that CMVR had a mild antileukemia effect without effect modification, in contrast to the impact of CMVR on NRM. Our findings may provide important implications for strategies used for CMV prophylaxis after HCT.",0
"The PAX5 (paired box 5) gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in B-cell development. PAX5 rearrangement is a recurrent abnormality seen in about 1.0-2.5% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases. In this study, we presented 3 cases of B-ALL harboring PAX5::ZCCHC7 rearrangement. We subsequently reviewed the literature and identified 45 additional B-ALL cases with PAX5::ZCCHC7. Our data showed that the majority of B-ALL patients with PAX5::ZCCHC7 were observed in various subtypes of B-ALL, including BCR::ABL1-like, BCR::ABL1, ETV6::RUNX1 and others. In B-ALL, PAX5::ZCCHC7 was always co-occur with other subtype-defining rearrangements, which as the sole abnormality in only 8 patients, with the remaining 34 patients harboring CRLF2, JAK2, TCF3 or other rearrangements. In PAX5::ZCCHC7, the PAX5 breakpoints are mainly between exon 1 and 2 (30/51). As a result, nearly all PAX5 protein domains are lost in PAX5::ZCCHC7, suggesting that the PAX5::ZCCHC7 seems to disrupt PAX5 similarly to a PAX5 deletion. In summary, the PAX5::ZCCHC7 is a recurrent genetic aberration in B-ALL and seems to act as an additional genetic abnormality of subtype-defining aberration. Whether the PAX5::ZCCHC7 could act as a leukemia-initiating event or not needs further investigation.",0
"We described the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York IIB (MSK-NYII) protocol pilot in 1993, for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children at high risk of early relapse. We now report MSK-NYII for the treatment of T-ALL/T-lymphoma over a 15-year period. A review of all patient charts identified 63 treated from 1/1/2000-12/31/2015, with a median follow-up of 9.9 years. Further follow-ups were confounded by the COVID pandemic. Remissions (CR) were defined as <5% marrow blast count on Day 28 and resolution of extramedullary disease. Forty-four had T-ALL, and 19 had stage III/IV lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL). Median age at diagnosis was 13.6 years (range 0.4 to 23.7). At diagnosis central nervous system (CNS) leukemia was present in 7/63 patients (11%), cranial nerve palsy in 3 (5%), CNS2 [<5cells/µL cerebrospinal fluid with blasts seen on cytospin] in 11 (17%), testicular enlargement in 3 (5%), and mediastinal mass in 45 (71%). On Day 8, 37 T-ALL (86%) were rapid early responders with <25% marrow blasts. 54 patients had an examination, cerebrospinal fluid, and marrow evaluation on day 28. Remission was demonstrated in 53 (98%) after prior marrow and CNS disease. The 19 T-lymphoma patients had no evidence of disease on day 28. Four relapses in marrow were recorded during therapy. Second remissions were able to be achieved. One patient died without having relapsed and is counted as an event in the event-free survival (EFS) analysis. Four patients, including 3 after the second CR transplant, died during follow-up. One unusual case of T-ALL recurred as T-LL of the colon 5.5 years after diagnosis, 3.5 years after therapy discontinuation. Fifteen years after diagnosis 88% (95% CI=78%-98%) survived event-free, and 91% (95% CI=82%-100%) survived. Twenty-five patients received irradiation. Three had RT to the testes, 3 had cranial RT for cranial nerve palsies, and 19 had cranial radiation for either CNS leukemia, CNS2, or for initial white blood cell >100,000/ µL. The MSK-NYIIB protocol, with a 94% 5-year and 88% 15-year EFS, is an effective therapy for the treatment of T-ALL/lymphoma, with similar toxicity to other high-risk regimens.",0
"Previous studies have indicated that there may be differences among the varieties of lemon flavonoids, but the details have not yet been made clear, which limits the comprehensive use of different cultivated lemon varieties. In this study, ultra-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole–time-of-flight–mass spectrometry (UPLC–Q–TOF–MS) and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) were used to investigate the types and contents of flavonoids in the flesh of the main cultivated variety (Eureka) and five common lemon varieties, as well as their in vitro antioxidant activity. A total of 21 compounds were identified, five of which were common compounds. Among them, Verna, Lisbon, and Bearss each have characteristic components that can serve as potential criteria for variety identification. Each of the six varieties of lemon has strong antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of different lemon varieties is related to flavonoids. Therefore, Eureka and the other five varieties of lemon are good natural antioxidants, and the cultivation and industrial production of lemons should consider the needs and selection of suitable varieties.",1
"A study with onion investigated the variation in the concentration of the potentially anticarcinogenic flavonol, quercetin owing to location, soil type and growth stage. Seven genotypes grown at two locations were analysed for aglycone and total quercetin concentration by reverse-phase high-performance-liquid-chromatography (RP-HPLC). Out of seven genotypes investigated, four showed significant differences (P= 0.05) in total quercetin concentration between two locations. In 1993, ‘Texas Grano 10I5Y’ (TG1015Y) bulbs collected at five growth stages were analysed for quercetin concentration by RP-HPLC. Quercetin concentration in ‘TG1015Y’ at different growth stages showed slight differences. Furthermore, quercetin concentration in bulbs harvested at second growth stage (23 March) was significantly (P= 0.05) greater than at the first growth stage (23 March). A slight difference in total quercetin concentration due to soil was noticed. This study shows that the site of growth of union is a major environmental factor in determining quercetin concentration but soil type and growth stage are not important.",1
"Development of a database of the soy iso.avone content of foods requires accurate and precise evaluation of different food matrixes. To evaluate accuracy, we estimated recoveries of both internal and external standards in 5 different soyfoods weekly. Standards were evaluated daily for system quality assurance. To evaluate sample precision, we analyzed soybeans and soymilk bimonthly for within-day precision and over 4 d for day-to-day precision. CVs should be = 8%. We validated our methods for single and multiple recovery concentrations by using our new internal standard, 2,4,4′-trihydroxydeoxybenzoin, and the external standards daidzein, genistein, and genistin. Concentrations of 12 iso.avone isomers, 3 aglycones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein), and 9 glucosides (daidzin, genistin, glycitin, acetyldaidzin, acetylgenistin, acetylglycitin, malonyldaidzin, malonylgenistin, and malonylglycitin) were measured in a variety of soybeans and soyfoods. The extraction methods used depended on soyfood type. The HPLC conditions for soy iso.avone analysis were improved, leading to good separation with a short analysis time (60 min/sample). A data bank of concentration and distribution of iso.avones in different soybean products was assembled. A wide range of iso.avone concentrations, from <50 μg/g to >20000 fg/g, was found in different soy products. The glucoside forms are almost twice the molecular weight of the aglycones; reported iso.avone concentrations should be normalized to the aglycone mass (or an iso.avonoid equivalent) rather than a simple sum of all isomers.",1
"The antioxidant capacity was determined in the peel of two apple cultivars (Jonagold and S'ampion) stored for 120 days at 1 °C, either in the regular cold chamber or in CA (2% CO2/2% O2). During long-term cold storage as well as during an additional 7 day storage of fruits at 16 °C, total phenols, total antioxidant activity (TAA), and radical scavenging activity (RSA) increased considerably, irrespective of the storage conditions. A slight decrease in anthocyanins was observed in apples stored in air, while the CA treatment did not cause any significant changes. Increase of soluble peroxidase (POD) activity was much stronger in apples kept in air than in CA, while, after a subsequent 7 day storage at high temperature, a further increase in enzyme activity was observed in all treatments. The high activity of polyphenoloxidase (PPO), determined in freshly harvested fruits, dropped to low (Jonadgold) or undetectable (S'ampion) levels after cold storage, both in the regular chamber and in CA, and increased slightly after the high temperature treatment. In the stored fruits a marked ethylene evolution was found, especially when stored in air.",1
"Lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, a neoplasm of precursor B or T lineage lymphoid cells, usually involves the bone marrow and peripheral blood, and may involve nodal and/or extranodal sites. The diagnosis is based on morphologic assessment, immunophenotypic analysis, usually by flow cytometry, and genetic analysis, including cytogenetics and FISH analysis, as well as molecular diagnostic analysis. This review will focus on the flow cytometric immunophenotypic findings in B- and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, which include expressions of early B or T cell markers, low-level expressions of CD45, as well as expressions of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and, in many cases, stem/progenitor cell marker CD34.",0
"The relationship between resveratrol (RES) bioavalability and its effect on tumor growth was investigated. Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and oral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. Half-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., was very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in plasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in mice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the first 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, and kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g fresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least 99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol of t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver can remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by t-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was found in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M cells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral administration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking water at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of mice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased hepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The antimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).",1
"An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG was the only active antioxidant.",1
"B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is a haematological disease resulting from haematopoietic system dysfunction, leading to the unchecked growth of immature B lymphoblasts. The disease's complexity is underscored by the spectrum of genetic aberrations that underlie B-ALL entities, necessitating advanced genetic analyses for precise classification and risk determination. Prior to the adoption of next-generation sequencing into standard diagnostic practices, up to 30% of B-ALL cases were not assigned to specific entities due to the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods. The advent of comprehensive genomic analysis, especially whole-genome transcriptome sequencing, has significantly enhanced our understanding of B-ALL's molecular heterogeneity, paving the way for the exploration of novel, tailored treatment strategies. Furthermore, recent technological innovations, such as optical genome mapping, methylation profiling, and single-cell sequencing, have propelled forward the fields of cancer research and B-ALL management. These innovations introduce novel diagnostic approaches and prognostic markers, facilitating a deeper, more nuanced understanding of individual patient disease profiles. This review focuses on the latest diagnostic standards and assays for B-ALL, the importance of new technologies and biomarkers in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and the expected role of innovative advancements in the future diagnosis and treatment of B-ALL.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer among children. Tobacco exposure during gestation has been investigated as a potential risk factor, but its role remains undefined. Given tobacco's toxicologic profile as a DNA-damaging agent, we examined the impact of DNA repair gene variability as a source of vulnerability to tobacco exposure risk for ALL. Leveraging demographic and genotype data from two large California-based ALL epidemiology studies, we used logistic regression, MinimumP (minP) statistical method, and permutation tests to examine interactions between DNA repair genes and prenatal tobacco exposure. We found statistically significant interactions between prenatal tobacco exposure and DNA repair genes RECQL (minP = 1.00 × 10-4, FDR-P value = 1.86 × 10-2) and TDG (minP = 1.00 × 10-4, FDR-P value = 1.86 × 10-2) with regard to childhood ALL risk. Notable interactions in the homologous recombination pathway were observed among Latino children, whereas non-Latino White children displayed significant interactions in the base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair pathways. Our study highlights the significance of DNA repair genes and pathways when evaluating environmental exposure to tobacco smoke, suggesting that genetic variability within these pathways could impact vulnerability in the development of childhood ALL. This study highlights the significant impact of genetic variation interacting with prenatal tobacco exposure on ALL risk. Further research is needed to understand these interactions and their implications for ALL etiology. Expanding studies to other gene-environment interactions will aid in developing targeted prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for pediatric oncology.",0
"To establish a similarity measurement model for patients with dentofacial deformity based on 3D craniofacial features and to validate the similarity results with quantifying subjective expert scoring. In the study, 52 cases of patients with skeletal Class Ⅲ malocclusions who underwent bimaxillary surgery and preoperative orthodontic treatment at Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology from January 2020 to December 2022, including 26 males and 26 females, were selected and divided into 2 groups by sex. One patient in each group was randomly selected as a reference sample, and the others were set as test samples. Three senior surgeons rated the similarity scores between the test samples and the reference sample. Similarity scores ranged from 1 to 10, where 1 was completely different, and 10 was exactly the same. Scores larger than 7.5 was considered as clinically similar. Preoperative cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and 3D facial images of the patients were collected. The three-dimensional hard and soft tissue features, including distances, angles and 3D point cloud features were extracted. The similarity measurement model was then established to fit with the experts' similarity scoring by feature selection algorithm and linear regression model. To verify the reliability of the model, 14 new patients were selected and input to similarity measurement model for finding similar cases. The similarity scoring of these similar cases were rated by experts, and used to evaluate the reliability of the model. The similarity metric models indicated that the features of the middle and lower craniofacial features were the main features to influence the craniofacial similarity. The main features that were related to the expert' s similarity scoring included distance of anterior nasal spine-menton (ANS-Me), distance of right upper canion point-Frankfurt horizontal plane (U3RH), distance of left superior point of the condyle-left gonion (CoL-GoL), distance of left gonion-menton (CoL-Me), distance of pogonion-midsagittal plane (Pog-MSP), distance of right alar base-left alar base (AlR-AlL), angle of pronasale-soft tissue pogonion-labrale inferius (Pn-Pog' -Li), distance of trichion-right tragus (Tri-TraR), distance of left exocanthion-left alar base (ExL-AlL), lower 1/3 of skeletal face, middle and lower 2/3 of skeletal face and upper lip region of soft tissue. Fourteen new patients were chosen to evaluate the model. The similar cases selected by the model had an average experts' similarity scoring of 7.627± 0.711, which was not significantly different with 7.5. The similarity measurement model established by this model could find the similar cases which highly matched experts' subjective similarity scoring. The study could be further used for similar cases retrieval in skeletal Ⅲ malocclusion patients. 建立一种基于牙颌面畸形患者三维颅面特征的相似性度量模型，并通过专家相似度评分对度量模型的有效性进行检测。 选取2020年1月至2022年12月在北京大学口腔医院行双颌手术及术前正畸治疗的骨性Ⅲ类牙颌面畸形患者52例，其中男性26例，女性26例，根据性别分为两组。每组各随机设置1例患者作为参考样本，该组内其余患者均为测试样本。由3位专家对测试样本与参考样本的相似度进行主观评分，评分范围为1~10分，其中1分为完全不同，10分为完全相同，设定7.5分为临床可接受的相似性结果。提取患者术前锥形束计算机断层扫描(cone beam computed tomography, CBCT) 和三维面部图像的三维硬、软组织颅面特征，包括距离、角度和三维点云特征等，采用特征选择算法和线性回归模型，并与专家相似度评分结果进行拟合，建立相似性度量模型。为验证模型的可靠性，选取14例新患者进行相似度匹配，并由专家评价匹配结果的相似度，以评价相似性度量模型的可靠性。 相似性度量模型显示，面中、下颅面特征是影响颅面相似度的主要特征，包括前鼻棘点-颏下点(anterior nasal spine-menton，ANS-Me)距离、右上尖牙点至眶耳平面(right canine-Frankfurt horizontal plane，U3RH)距离、左髁顶点-左下颌角点(left superior point of condyle-left gonion, CoL-GoL)距离、左髁顶点-颏下点(left condyle-menton, CoL-Me)距离、颏前点至正中矢状面垂直(pogonion-midsagittal plane, Pog-MSP)距离、右鼻翼点-左鼻翼点(right alar base-left alar base, AlR-AlL)距离、鼻尖点-软组织颏前点-下唇点(pronasale-soft tissue pogonion-labrale inferius, Pn-Pog’-Li)交角、发际点-右侧耳屏点(trichion-right tragus, Tri-TraR)距离、左外眦点-左鼻翼点(left exocanthion-left alar base, ExL-AlL)距离、骨性面下1/3、骨性面中下2/3及软组织上唇区域等。在模型可靠性测试中，14例相似性匹配案例的平均相似度评分为(7.627±0.711)分，与7.5分差异无统计学意义。 本研究使用的相似性度量模型寻找的相似案例与专家主观评价匹配度高，可用于骨性Ⅲ类患者的相似案例检索。",0
"Simultaneous determination of alcohols, amines, amino acids, flavonoids, and purine and pyrimidine bases in bottled beer samples directly without any pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and quantitative and has been applied to seven types of international bottled beers of different origins bought locally.",1
"The phenolic composition of the seed coat and the cotyledon of two varieties of lentils, Pardina and Castellana have been investigated by HPLC-photodiode array detection (PAD) and HPLC-MS. Large quantitative and qualitative differences have been found in the phenolic composition of the two seed parts. In both varieties of lentils the seed coat is very rich in catechins, procyanidins dimers and trimers, and in minor concentration it contains glycosides of quercetin, myricetin, luteolin and apigenin. The cotyledon contains mainly hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids in low concentration. Two esters of the trans-p-coumaric acid, p-coumaroylmalic acid and p-coumaroylglycolic acid have been identified in the cotyledon, and the stilbene trans-resveratrol-5-glucoside in the seed coat. These compounds had not previously been reported in lentils. Results presented allow an overview of the distribution of the phenolic compounds in the seed lentils, and contribute to knowledge of the implications in dietary intake of these compounds.",1
"There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside (4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol [(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these products.",1
"Extracts of aromatic plants contain bioactive substances such as phenolic compounds, which could be used as natural antioxidants. Conventional, as well as ultrasonically assisted extractions (UAEs) of phenolic compounds from aromatic plants using different solvents, have been studied. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with ultraviolet detection was employed for the analysis of phenolic compounds. Total phenolic compounds were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu assay. The amount of extractable phenolic substances for this method decreased with decreasing polarity of the solvent in the order water, 60% methanol, 60% acetone, and ethyl acetate/water (60:30, v/v). The HPLC results indicate that UAE is a more effective technic compared to the conventional method but was dependent on the solvent and the temperature employed. Increasing the temperature of sonication, the efficiency of extraction of phenolic compounds for all solvents is enhanced. However, water extraction was found to give reduced amounts of phenolic compounds when compared with the conventional method.",1
"A finite element model of cervical kyphosis was established to analyze the stress of cervical spine under suspensory traction and to explore the mechanism and effect of it. A patient with typical cervical kyphosis (C2-C5) underwent CT scan imaging, and 3D slicer was used to reconstruct the C2 to T2 vertebral bodies. The reconstructed data was imported into Hypermesh 2020 and Abaqus 2017 for meshing and finite element analysis. The changes of the kyphotic angle and the von Mises stress on the annulus fibrosus of each intervertebral disc and ligaments were analyzed under suspensory traction conditions. With the increase of suspensory traction weight, the overall kyphosis of cervical spine showed a decreasing trend. The correction of kyphosis was mainly contributed by the change of kyphotic segments. The kyphotic angle of C2-C5 was corrected from 45° to 13° finally. In cervical intervertebral discs, the stress was concentrated to anterior and posterior part, except for C4-5. The stress of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) decreased from the rostral to the caudal, and the high level von Mises stress of the kyphotic segments appeared at C2-C3, C3-C4, and C4-C5. The roles of the other ligaments were not obvious. The kyphotic angle was significantly reduced by the suspensory traction. Shear effect due to the high von Mises stress in the anterior and posterior parts of annulus fibrosus and the tension on the anterior longitudinal ligament play a role in the correction of cervical kyphosis.",0
"Bypassing the anti-tumor functions of the immune system is one of the keys to tumor survival. Tumors, especially hematological tumors, produce or express factors that retune T and B cells to inhibit the immune response. Coreceptors CD28 and CTLA-4, and their ligands, CD80 and CD86, are involved in the immunological synapse and play an important role in immune processes. CD86 is widely expressed in hematological tumors, mainly of B-cell origin, and only a few studies are available about its role in the pathogenesis. This study discusses the importance of CD86 expression in hematological malignancies. Does its presence help or hinder the development and survival of tumor cells? The answer to this question will facilitate a more profound comprehension of the biology of hematological malignancies and the development of new therapeutic options.",0
"A GC-MS method was developed for the determination of various flavonoids and phenolic and benzoic acids in human plasma. The procedure involved the extraction of flavonoids and phenolic and benzoic acids with ethyl acetate, followed by the derivatization of the phenolic and benzoic compounds with BSTFA (N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide) + TMCS (trimethylchlorosilane) reagent. The trimethylsilyl derivatives formed were separated and quantitated using GC-MS. Twenty flavonoids and phenolic and benzoic compounds have been well separated in the spiked human plasma without any interference. The average recovery was 79.3%. Several phenolic acids such as o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxyphenylacetic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, ferulic, sinapic, and benzoic acid were identified and quantified in human plasma after consumption of a cranberry juice. This developed method provides a simple, specific, and sensitive technique for the simultaneous determination of flavonoids and phenolic and benzoic acids in human plasma and is suitable for bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies.",1
"Spontaneous remission (SR) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a poorly understood phenomenon that has been sporadically reported in medical literature for over a century, and the molecular and immunologic mechanisms of remission pose interesting clinical questions. Furthermore, the often-transient nature of these remissions poses a challenge to physicians in formulating an approach to treatment. We report on a rare case of",0
"Relapsed and refractory disease in children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R T-ALL) remains a major clinical challenge. Outcomes for children who relapse or exhibit resistance to initial treatments are dismal, with survival rates frequently below 25% despite aggressive therapy. To minimize toxicities and improve outcomes, individualized precision medicine approaches targeting the underlying biology of R/R T-ALL are especially important, considering that T-ALL is characterized by genetic, epigenetic and posttranscriptional heterogeneity, and organ and niche specificities (e.g. the central nervous system), all of which underlie disease progression and therapy resistance. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the complexity of pediatric T-ALL biology and how such knowledge may be clinically leveraged, emphasizing the need for innovative therapeutic routes to improve outcomes for children with R/R T-ALL. Emerging approaches that hold promise or show palpable results include proteasome inhibitors, BCL-2 antagonists, and JAK (for JAK- and IL-7R-driven cases), ABL and SRC family tyrosine kinase (for LCK-activated cases), MEK or PI3K-mTOR inhibitors. MYC-targeting agents, DNA demethylating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, splicing modulators, or drugs exploring T-ALL metabolic vulnerabilities, are other examples for potential pharmacological intervention. Immunotherapies, particularly CAR T-cell products targeting CD7 and other markers, but also biologics (e.g. targeting CD38), are under development and increasing interest. These agents should be rationally integrated into precision medicine combination therapies informed by genetic, epigenetic, and posttranscriptional insights that will be essential to refine risk stratification and minimize the risk of resistance. Novel strategies leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning could accelerate discovery and optimize treatment frameworks.",0
"A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.",1
"The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released aglycones.",1
"A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the quantification of quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in rat plasma. After being treated with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase, the analytes were extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with the internal standard (IS; baicalein). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Diamonsil C(18) column with a mobile phase consisting of 2% formic acid/methanol (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min, with a split of 200 microL to the mass spectrometer. Validation results indicated that the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1 ng . mL(-1). The assay exhibited a linear range of 1-200 ng . mL(-1) and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9980 or better for each analyte. Quality control samples (1, 5, 20 and 100 ng . mL(-1)) in six replicates from each of three different runs demonstrated an intra-assay precision (RSD) of 1.1-8.9%, an inter-assay precision of 1.6-10.8%, and an overall accuracy (bias) of <13.4%. The extraction recovery of each analyte and internal standard was 70-80%. In the present study, we have investigated the pharmacokinetic profiles of isorhamnetin after oral application in rats equipped with a jugular catheter. After oral dosing of isorhamnetin, the mean values (n = 10) of C(max) were 57.8, 64.8 and 75.2 ng . mL(-1) which were achieved at a T(max) of 8.0, 6.4 and 7.2 h for oral doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg . kg(-1) body weight, respectively. The corresponding mean values for isorhamnetin area under the curver (AUC) from 0 to 60 h were 838.2, 1262.8, 1623.4 ng . h . mL(-1). Our results further demonstrated that the samples analyzed showed isorhamnetin could not be transformed into quercetin or kaempferol in rats, indicating that the demethylation of the 3'-oxymethyl group of isorhamnetin does not occur in Wistar rats.",1
"Natural killer (NK) cells are important for early tumor immune surveillance. In patients with hematological cancers, NK cells are generally functional deficient and display dysregulations in their receptor repertoires. Acute leukemia is the most common cancer in children, and we here performed a comparative phenotypic profiling of NK cells from B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients to identify aberrant NK cell phenotypes. NK cell phenotypes, maturation, and function were analyzed in matched bone marrow and blood NK cells from BCP-ALL patients at diagnosis, during treatment, and at end of treatment and compared with age-matched pediatric control subjects. Expression of several markers were skewed in patients, but with large interindividual variations. Undertaking a multiparameter approach, we found that high expression levels of NKG2A was the single predominant marker distinguishing NK cells in BCP-ALL patients compared with healthy control subjects. Moreover, naïve CD57-NKG2A NK cells dominated in BCP-ALL patients at diagnosis. Further, we found dysregulated expression of the activating receptor DNAM-1 in resident bone marrow CXCR6+ NK cells. CXCR6+ NK cells lacking DNAM-1 expressed NKG2A and had a tendency for lower degranulation activity. In conclusion, high expression of NKG2A dominates NK cell phenotypes from pediatric BCP-ALL patients, indicating that NKG2A could be targeted in therapies for this patient group.",0
"The In 2023, the world saw the highest global temperatures in over 100 000 years, and heat records were broken in all continents through 2022. Adults older than 65 years and infants younger than 1 year, for whom extreme heat can be particularly life-threatening, are now exposed to twice as many heatwave days as they would have experienced in 1986–2005 (indicator 1.1.2). Harnessing the rapidly advancing science of detection and attribution, new analysis shows that over 60% of the days that reached health-threatening high temperatures in 2020 were made more than twice as likely to occur due to anthropogenic climate change (indicator 1.1.5); and heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years increased by 85% compared with 1990–2000, substantially higher than the 38% increase that would have been expected had temperatures not changed (indicator 1.1.5). Simultaneously, climate change is damaging the natural and human systems on which people rely for good health. The global land area affected by extreme drought increased from 18% in 1951–60 to 47% in 2013–22 (indicator 1.2.2), jeopardising water security, sanitation, and food production. A higher frequency of heatwaves and droughts in 2021 was associated with 127 million more people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity compared with 1981–2010 (indicator 1.4), putting millions of people at risk of malnutrition and potentially irreversible health effects. The changing climatic conditions are also putting more populations at risk of life-threatening infectious diseases, such as dengue, malaria, vibriosis, and West Nile virus (indicator 1.3). Compounding these direct health impacts, the economic losses associated with global heating increasingly harm livelihoods, limit resilience, and restrict the funds available to tackle climate change. Economic losses from extreme weather events increased by 23% between 2010–14 and 2018–22, amounting to US$264 billion in 2022 alone (indicator 4.1.1), whereas heat exposure led to global potential income losses worth $863 billion (indicators 1.1.4 and 4.1.3). Labour capacity loss resulting from heat exposure affected low and medium Human Development Index (HDI) countries the most, exacerbating global inequities, with potential income losses equivalent to 6·1% and 3·8% of their gross domestic product (GDP), respectively (indicator 4.1.3). The multiple and simultaneously rising risks of climate change are amplifying global health inequities and threatening the very foundations of human health. Health systems are increasingly strained, and 27% of surveyed cities declared concerns over their health systems being overwhelmed by the impacts of climate change (indicator 2.1.3). Often due to scarce financial resources and low technical and human capacity, the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts also face the most challenges in achieving adaptation progress, reflecting the human risks of an unjust transition. Only 44% of low HDI countries and 54% of medium HDI countries reported high implementation of health emergency management capacities in 2022, compared with 85% of very high HDI countries (indicator 2.2.5). Additionally, low and medium HDI countries had the highest proportion of cities not intending to undertake a climate change risk assessment in 2021 (12%; indicator 2.1.3). These inequalities are aggravated by the persistent failure of the wealthiest countries to deliver the promised modest annual sum of $100 billion to support climate action in those countries defined as developing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Consequently, those countries that have historically contributed the least to climate change are bearing the brunt of its health impacts—both a reflection and a direct consequence of the structural inequities that lie within the root causes of climate change. The growing threats experienced to date are early signs and symptoms of what a rapidly changing climate could mean for the health of the world’s populations. With 1337 tonnes of CO The health risks of a 2°C hotter world underscore the health imperative of accelerating climate change action. With limits to adaptation drawing closer, ambitious mitigation is paramount to keep the magnitude of health hazards within the limits of the capacity of health systems to adapt. Yet years of scientific warnings of the threat to people’s lives have been met with grossly insufficient action, and policies to date have put the world on track to almost 3°C of heating. The 2022 Despite the challenges, data also expose the transformative health benefits that could come from the transition to a zero-carbon future, with health professionals playing a crucial role in ensuring these gains are maximised. Globally, 775 million people still live without electricity, and close to 1 billion people are still served by health-care facilities without reliable energy. With structural global inequities in the development of, access to, and use of clean energy, only 2·3% of electricity in low HDI countries comes from modern renewables (against 11% in very high HDI countries), and 92% of households in low HDI countries still rely on biomass fuels to meet their energy needs (against 7·5% in very high HDI countries; indicators 3.1.1 and 3.1.2). In this context, the transition to renewables can enable access to decentralised clean energy and, coupled with interventions to increase energy efficiency, can reduce energy poverty and power high quality health-supportive services. By reducing the burning of dirty fuels (including fossil fuels and biomass), such interventions could help avoid a large proportion of the 1·9 million deaths that occur annually from dirty-fuel-derived, outdoor, airborne, fine particulate matter pollution (PM With the world currently heading towards 3°C of heating, any further delays in climate change action will increasingly threaten the health and survival of billions of people alive today. If meaningful, the prioritisation of health in upcoming international climate change negotiations could offer an unprecedented opportunity to deliver health-promoting climate action and pave the way to a thriving future. However, delivering such an ambition will require confronting the economic interests of the fossil fuel and other health-harming industries, and delivering science-grounded, steadfast, meaningful, and sustained progress to shift away from fossil fuels, accelerate mitigation, and deliver adaptation for health. Unless such progress materialises, the growing emphasis on health within climate change negotiations risks being mere healthwashing; increasing the acceptability of initiatives that minimally advance action, and which ultimately undermine—rather than protect—the future of people alive today and generations to come. Safeguarding people’s health in climate policies will require the leadership, integrity, and commitment of the health community. With its science-driven approach, this community is uniquely positioned to ensure that decision makers are held accountable, and foster human-centred climate action that safeguards human health above all else. The ambitions of the Paris Agreement are still achievable, and a prosperous and healthy future still lies within reach. But the concerted efforts and commitments of health professionals, policy makers, corporations, and financial institutions will be needed to ensure the promise of health-centred climate action becomes a reality that delivers a thriving future for all.",0
"Samples of buckwheat from four cultivars grown at three locations in western Canada for 4 years were used to study the effect of cultivar, location, and growing season on the flavonoid content and antioxidative activities of the seed. Buckwheat contained an average of 387 and 1314 mg/100 g of flavonoid and 47 and 77 mg/100 g of rutin in the seed and hull, respectively. Location was the main source of variation for flavonoid and rutin contents of the seed, while growing season had significant influence on the flavonoid content of the hulls. Variation in antioxidative activities was mainly due to a cultivar × environment effect. Antioxidative activities expressed as AOX (Δ log A470/min), AA (% inhibition relative to control), and ORR (oxidation rate ratio) ranged from 0.42, 114, and 0.16 to 1.63, 48, and 0.59, respectively. Flavonoid content in buckwheat was strongly correlated with rutin content and weakly associated with antioxidative activities, while rutin content was not related to antioxidative activities.",1
"Youth diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and their caregiver's experience a myriad of challenges in all domains of health that extend beyond treatment. Yet, little is known about how the cancer experience, and recollections associated with the experience, impact survivorship. We explored pediatric ALL survivors' and their caregivers' autobiographical memories of the cancer experience from diagnosis onwards. Survivors of ALL, and one of their caregivers, were recruited through a local clinic. Survivors and their caregivers completed a demographic survey and semi-structured, private, one-on-one interviews. Demographic information were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis at the level of the individual and dyad. Insights from survivors (N = 19; M Findings highlight the varied and long-lasting ways cancer impacts survivors of pediatric ALL and their caregivers. Survivors had difficultly remembering their experience or felt that information was withheld and were acutely aware of their caregiver's distress. Caregivers were cautious and intentionally limited the information they shared. Survivors desired to be included within, or told about, decisions related to their healthcare and were acutely aware of their caregiver's distress. Efforts should be made to communicate with survivors (from diagnosis onward) openly and to consider strategies to minimize the short- and long-term impacts of pediatric ALL among survivors and their caregivers.",0
"What is the contamination rate by cancer cells and spermatogonia numbers in immature testicular tissue (ITT) harvested before the start of gonadotoxic therapy in boys with a hematological malignancy? Among our cohort of boys diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphomas, 39% (n = 11/28) had cancer cells identified in their tissues at the time of diagnosis and all patients appeared to have reduced spermatogonia numbers compared to healthy reference cohorts. Young boys affected by a hematological cancer are at risk of contamination of their testes by cancer cells but histological examination is unable to detect the presence of only a few cancer cells, which would preclude autotransplantation of cryobanked ITT for fertility restoration, and more sensitive detection techniques are thus required. Reduced numbers of spermatogonia in ITT in hematological cancer patients have been suggested based on results in a limited number of patients. This retrospective cohort study included 54 pre- and peri-pubertal boys who were diagnosed with a hematological malignancy and who underwent a testicular biopsy for fertility preservation at the time of diagnosis before any gonadotoxic therapy between 2005 and 2021. Among the 54 patients eligible in our database, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) testicular tissue was available for 28 boys diagnosed either with ALL (n = 14) or lymphoma (n = 14) and was used to evaluate malignant cell contamination. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed for each patient to search for cancer cells in the tissue. Markers specific to each patient's disease were identified at the time of diagnosis on the biopsy of the primary tumor or bone marrow aspiration and an immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on the FFPE ITT for each patient to evidence his disease markers. PCR analyses on the FFPE tissue were also conducted when a specific gene rearrangement was available. The mean age at diagnosis and ITT biopsy of the 28 boys was 7.5 years (age range: 19 months-16 years old). Examination of ITT of the 28 boys on H&E stained sections did not detect malignant cells. Using IHC, we found contamination by cancerous cells using markers specific to the patient's disease in 10 of 28 boys, with a higher rate in patients diagnosed with ALL (57%, n = 8/14) compared with lymphoma (14%, n = 2/14) (P-value < 0.05). PCR showed contamination in three of 15 patients who had specific rearrangements identified on their bone marrow at the time of diagnosis; one of these patients had negative results from the IHC. Compared to age-related reference values of the number of spermatogonia per ST (seminiferous tubule) (Spg/ST) throughout prepuberty of healthy patients from a simulated control cohort, mean spermatogonial numbers appeared to be decreased in all age groups (0-4 years: 1.49 ± 0.54, 4-7 years: 1.08 ± 0.43, 7-11 years: 1.56 ± 0.65, 11-14 years: 3.37, 14-16 years: 5.44 ± 3.14). However, using a cohort independent method based on the Z-score, a decrease in spermatogonia numbers was not confirmed. The results obtained from the biopsy fragments that were evaluated for contamination by cancer cells may not be representative of the entire cryostored ITT and tumor foci may still be present outside of the biopsy range. ITT from boys diagnosed with a hematological malignancy could bear the risk for cancer cell reseeding in case of autotransplantation of the tissue. Such a high level of cancer cell contamination opens the debate of harvesting the tissue after one or two rounds of chemotherapy. However, as the safety of germ cells can be compromised by gonadotoxic treatments, this strategy warrants for the development of adapted fertility restoration protocols. Finally, the impact of the hematological cancer on spermatogonia numbers should be further explored. The project was funded by a grant from the FNRS-Télévie (grant n°. 7.4533.20) and Fondation Contre le Cancer/Foundation Against Cancer (2020-121) for the research project on fertility restoration with testicular tissue from hemato-oncological boys. The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. N/A.",0
"Nocino is an after-dinner liqueur made with green, unripe walnuts, appreciated both for its appealing flavour and aroma, and for its properties as a tonic and digestive aid. There is a large number of recipes for the production of nocino and the industrial production coexists with preparations at home. The liqueur has never been scientifically investigated; thus the aim of this work was to examine various kinds of it. Three sets of samples were considered: Commercial brands, home-made nocino and, among the latter, samples made for years with the same recipe and aged for different times, up to 25 years. In the commercial products, the phenolic profiles and the antioxidant activities were widely variable. The antioxidant activity proved to be directly correlated with the content of total phenols, total tannins and non-tannin phenolics. Study of samples aged for different lengths of time showed that the characteristics considered remained substantially unchanged during the aging process.",1
"The few epidemiologic studies of infection exposure in early life and acute leukemia (AL) risk in Latino children have yielded inconsistent results, suggesting a possible effect of ethnicity. Here, we examined the correlation between infection exposure and acute leukemia risk in children from Mexico City-One of the biggest Latino cities worldwide. This study included 1455 Mexican children diagnosed with de novo AL (2002-2016), and 1455 control individuals frequency-matched by age and health institution. The AL population included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Pre-B ALL, and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate direct and indirect proxies of infection in children or their mothers. Upper respiratory tract infections during the child's first year of life were a risk factor for AL (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.48-5.15), including ALL (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.67-5.89) and Pre-B (OR, 3.11; 95% CI, 1.63-5.96). Mother's infections before and during pregnancy were protective factors against AL (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.47-0.64; and OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52-0.72, respectively). These associations included ALL and Pre-B. In contrast, only mothers' infections before pregnancy and respiratory tract infections were protective factors against AML (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.62; and OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37-0.68, respectively). Infections during the first year of life were associated with AL development in children of Mexico City. Additionally, mothers' exposure to respiratory tract infections before and during pregnancy reduced the AL risk in this Latino population.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a challenging pediatric and adult haematologic disease still associated with an unsatisfactory cure rate. Unlike B-ALL, the availability of novel therapeutic options to definitively improve the life expectancy for relapsed/resistant patients is poor. Indeed, the shared expression of surface targets among normal and neoplastic T-cells still limits the efficacy and may induce fratricide effects, hampering the use of innovative immunotherapeutic strategies. However, novel monoclonal antibodies, bispecific T-cell engagers (BTCEs), and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T-cells recently showed encouraging results and some of them are in an advanced stage of pre-clinical development or are currently under investigation in clinical trials. Here, we review this exciting scenario focusing on most relevant advances, challenges, and perspectives of the emerging landscape of immunotherapy of T-cell malignancies.",0
"Relapse/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (r/r B-ALL) represents paediatric cancer with a challenging prognosis. CAR T-cell treatment, considered an advanced treatment, remains controversial due to high relapse rates and adverse events. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of CAR T-cell therapy for r/r B-ALL. The literature search was performed on four databases. Efficacy parameters included minimal residual disease negative complete remission (MRD-CR) and relapse rate (RR). Safety parameters constituted cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Anti-CD22 showed superior efficacy with the highest MRD-CR event rate and lowest RR, compared to anti-CD19. Combining CAR T-cell therapy with haploidentical stem cell transplantation improved RR. Safety-wise, bispecific anti-CD19/22 had the lowest CRS rate, and anti-CD22 showed the fewest ICANS. Analysis of the costimulatory receptors showed that adding CD28ζ to anti-CD19 CAR T-cell demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing relapses with favorable safety profiles. Choosing a more efficacious and safer CAR T-cell treatment is crucial for improving overall survival in acute leukaemia. Beyond the promising anti-CD22 CAR T-cell, exploring costimulatory domains and new CD targets could enhance treatment effectiveness for r/r B-ALL.",0
"Exhausted CD8+ T-cells over-express immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), which interact with their ligands on malignant cells. However, some ICRs have been reported to be expressed on both T-cells and tumor cells, including V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), Galectin-9, and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3). We aimed to evaluate the mRNA expression of VISTA, Galectin-9, and TIM-3 on CD8+ T-cells and leukemic cells in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Samples were obtained from 26 untreated B-ALL patients and 25 control subjects. CD8+ T-cells were isolated using Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS). Relative gene expression was then evaluated by qRT-PCR with specific primers for VISTA, Galectin-9, and TIM-3. Also, the mRNA expression profile and clinical data of 154 B-ALL patients were obtained from the TARGET. mRNA expression of Galectin-9 on CD8+ T-cells in B-ALL patients was significantly lower than those in the control group ( Collectively, gene expression results suggest an important role for TIM-3, but not VISTA and Galectin-9, in B-ALL and it seems that TIM-3 could be a candidate for immune checkpoint therapy.",0
"We aim to determine the optimal dosing of midazolam continuous intravenous infusions for the treatment of pediatric refractory status epilepticus (RSE). We searched Medline ALL, Embase, Embase Classic, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Web of Science in March 2023 and again in February 2024. Randomized and non-randomized studies involving pediatric patients who received continuous midazolam for the treatment of RSE were eligible. Two authors independently conducted screening, full-text review, and data extraction. All methods followed PRISMA reporting guidelines. A narrative data synthesis was performed due to data heterogeneity. Nineteen studies (448 patients) proved eligible; 3 were randomized control trials, while 16 were non-randomized studies. All studies had concerns regarding the risk of bias. Overall, midazolam aborted seizures in 363/448 (81%) participants, with mean effective doses of 1.7-13.0 μg/kg/min (0.17-0.78 mg/kg/h). The remaining 85 participants (19%) who did not achieve seizure cessation received maximum doses of 1.7-32.0 μg/kg/min (0.17-1.92 mg/kg/h) prior to transitioning to another agent. Only 4 studies specified that boluses were given with each titration. Twelve studies reported that seizure cessation occurred at a mean time of 1.4-546.0 min (range 0-720 min) after midazolam initiation. In 8 of these studies, effective midazolam doses clustered at 2.0-5.0 μg/kg/min (0.12-0.30 mg/kg/h), with seizure cessation occurring within 10-70 min in 204/221 (92%) participants. Treatment-associated adverse events included intubation in 42/221 (19%) and hypotension requiring fluids or no intervention in 18/221 (8%). The studies did not differentiate between intubations performed as part of the study protocol or prior to midazolam infusion initiation nor did they specify whether hypotension was related to the co-administration of phenytoin or phenobarbital. Data supporting midazolam continuous infusion dosing are limited and heterogeneous. Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic window at rates of 2.0-5.0 μg/kg/min (0.12-0.30 mg/kg/h), with limited adverse risks. Earlier seizure cessation may be achieved by targeting this therapeutic window by starting treatment with higher doses than the typically used 1.0 μg/kg/min (0.06 mg/kg/h) or by rapidly escalating the dose.",0
"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of the FIT FIRST FOR ALL school-based physical activity program on health-related physical fitness in Faroese schoolchildren. The program aimed to add three weekly sessions of organized high-intensity physical activity to the standard weekly physical education sessions for all pupils across the entire school. A non-randomized controlled design was used to evaluate the effects of the program. Two schools participated, including one intervention school (INT; A significant time × group effect ( The FIT FIRST FOR ALL program significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness and agility, and it led to favorable changes in body composition in the intervention school. These findings suggest that the program is highly effective in enhancing physical fitness and health status across all investigated age groups when implemented at a school-wide level.",0
"Thirty-one wine samples differing in their origin of production and vintages were analyzed for total phenolic content, total and free sulfur dioxide contents, and superoxide radical scavenging potentials. The polyphenol content of red wine ranged from 735.9 to 2858 ppm, and that of white wine was in the range 259.4−720.5 ppm. Total sufur dioxide content ranged from 21.9 to 270.7 ppm, and had no correlation to the color of the wine. Superoxide radical scavenging activity values ranged from 39.3 to 215.9 units/mL for the white wine, and those of red varieties were ∼5−10 times higher. No correlation was observed between the free and total sulfur dioxide contents in the different wine samples tested and their superoxide radical scavenging activity values. A direct correlation between the color of the wine (r = 0.7517), its phenolic content (r = 0.9908), and the ability of the wine constituents to scavenge superoxide radical was, however, established by a simple regression analysis.",1
"Exercise tolerance prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an important prognostic indicator. Nevertheless, patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) before HSCT have reduced exercise tolerance after multiple rounds of chemotherapy. Exercise is encouraged in these patients to prevent reduced exercise tolerance. However, exercise compliance is reduced during chemotherapy. Therefore, we focused on the potential role of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which improves exercise tolerance but requires fewer interventions. The efficacy and safety of HIIT in patients undergoing chemotherapy remain unknown. Here, we report an exercise intervention that incorporated HIIT in a patient with ALL undergoing consolidation chemotherapy (CC). The patient was a 40-year-old female diagnosed with ALL for whom rehabilitation was implemented after initiation of induction chemotherapy. The patient underwent aerobic exercise on an ergometer (20 min at 50-60% intensity, using the Karvonen method) and weight-bearing resistance training (three sets of 10-20 repetitions at a 4-5 rating on the modified Borg scale) five times a week. The physical function assessment before the third CC session showed decreased exercise tolerance. An HIIT intervention was added as a more effective rehabilitation strategy for the patient. HIIT was performed on an ergometer. The protocol consisted of a 5-min warm-up, three to four sets of alternating between 80-90% peak oxygen uptake (peak VO",0
"Disorders of gambling are more common among the mentally ill, including in people with psychotic disorders. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature regarding the prevalence and correlates of gambling disorders in people with psychotic disorders. We systematically reviewed English-language literature through searches of six bibliographic databases, all run on 11 November 2022: Medline ALL, Embase, Emcare, APA PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library. Observational studies that reported the prevalence of gambling in psychotic disorders or psychosis among gamblers were included. Studies were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools. Sixteen studies, including 1,116,103 participants, from across a range of settings, were included. Most studies were done on males and recruited participants with a mean age of 40 years. Most of the studies (n = 12) were cross-sectional, and the remaining were case control in design. Most of the studies rated fair in quality. The prevalence of gambling among psychotic population ranged from 0.32 to 19.3%, with the majority of the studies reporting rates between 6.4 and 17%. The rates were 5-25 times higher than in the general population. While there were no consistent associations found with socio-demographic indices, several studies reported an association between gambling behaviours and substance use disorder among those with psychotic illnesses. Our research suggests that clinicians should assess for comorbid gambling among those with psychotic illness, particularly in those with mood symptoms, impulsivity, and substance use disorders. Gambling can negatively impact on their financial and social situations. Future research should study specific strategies or therapies among those with comorbid gambling and psychotic disorders.",0
"Accurate determination of B/T-cell lineage and the presence of the ETV6-RUNX1 translocation is critical for diagnosing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as these factors influence treatment decisions and outcomes. However, these diagnostic processes often rely on advanced tools unavailable in low-resource settings, creating a need for alternative solutions. We developed a deep learning pipeline to analyze Giemsa-stained bone marrow (BM) aspirate smears. The models were trained to distinguish between ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and non-leukemic BM samples, predict B- and T-cell lineage in ALL, and detect the presence of the ETV6-RUNX1 translocation. The performance was evaluated using cross-validation (CV) and an external validation cohort. The models achieved a statistically significant area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 in distinguishing ALL from AML and control samples. In cross-validation (CV), the models achieved a cross-validation AUC of 0.74 for predicting B/T subtypes. For predicting ETV6-RUNX1 translocation, the models achieved an AUC of 0.80. External cohort validation confirmed significant AUCs of 0.72 for B/T subtype classification and 0.69 for ETV6-RUNX1 translocation prediction. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate potential as a diagnostic tool for pediatric ALL, enabling the identification of B/T lineage and ETV6-RUNX1 translocation from Giemsa-stained smears. These results pave the way for future utilization of CNNs as a diagnostic modality for pediatric leukemia in low-resource settings, where access to advanced diagnostic techniques is limited.",0
"BackgroundPrognostic models are crucial for predicting patient outcomes and aiding clinical decision making. Despite their availability in acute neurologic care, their use in clinical practice is limited, with insufficient reflection on reasons for this scarce implementation.PurposeTo summarize facilitators and barriers among clinicians affecting the use of prognostic models in acute neurologic care.Data SourcesSystematic searches were conducted in Embase, Medline ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until February 2024.Study SelectionEligible studies included those providing clinicians' perspectives on the use of prognostic models in acute neurologic care.Data ExtractionData were extracted concerning study characteristics, study aim, data collection and analysis, prognostic models, participant characteristics, facilitators, and barriers.

Identified facilitators included improved communication with patients and surrogate decision makers (",0
"Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.",1
"In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.",1
"The incidence of asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may lead to treatment delays and insufficient drug exposure, thereby increasing the risk of ALL relapse. We aimed to understand the clinical characteristics and management of AAP, which are crucial for improving treatment outcomes in children with ALL. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of children diagnosed with AAP and admitted to Hebei Children's Hospital between April 2019 and July 2024. We analyzed the clinical characteristics and management strategies of AAP in children with ALL, with a particular focus on the treatment strategies and AAP recurrence in children who were rechallenged with pegaspargase (PEG-ASP). Among 474 patients treated for ALL, 32 were diagnosed with AAP (incidence rate, 6.8%). Of these 32 cases, mild pancreatitis accounted for 50.0% (16/32), moderately severe pancreatitis for 43.8% (14/32), and severe pancreatitis for 6.3% (2/32). AAP occurred most frequently during the induction and early intensive therapy phases. The median time to onset of AAP was 10.5 (1-26) days, and the median number of PEG-ASP doses administered was three (range 1-11). Notably, 53.1% (17/32) patients were rechallenged with PEG-ASP, of whom seven experienced AAP recurrence, including one with three episodes. Despite these statuses, all patients either recovered or showed improvement in their disease status, and no mortality was reported. AAP in children with ALL can be effectively managed through early detection and appropriate treatment. Rechallenge with PEG-ASP should be individualized to balance the risk of recurrence against the benefits of continued therapy.",0
"The phenolic composition of red and white wines from four Spanish Appellations of Origin (official classification of Spanish wines) was investigated. Different hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, catechins, procyanidins, alcohols, stilbenes and flavonols were identified. Additionally, the ketone 2,3-dihydroxy-1-guaiacylpropan-1-one was identified for the first time in red wines aged in oak barrels. The concentration of most of the phenolic compounds quantified was higher in red wines than in white wines, as would be expected from the different methods of vinification and the grape varieties used. These differences could also contribute to differences in the antioxidant ability of these wines. The multivariate analysis applied to the phenolic compounds quantified allowed the relationships among these compounds to be examined and the origin of the wines to be distinguished.",1
"The real-world data of flumatinib, a China-developed second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), on Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) is limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of flumatinib combined with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for Ph+ ALL. This multicenter retrospective study included 65 adults with de novo Ph+ ALL treated with flumatinib (600 mg/day) plus intensive chemotherapy. Outcomes included complete remission (CR), CR with minimal residual disease negativity detected by multiparameter flow cytometry (CR CR and CR Flumatinib-based regimens demonstrated high efficacy and tolerable toxicity in Ph+ ALL, which was comparable to other second-generation TKIs. T315I and Y253H mutations were key drivers of relapse. Although allo-HSCT enhanced survival, longer follow-up period and prospective trials are warranted to validate these findings.",0
"Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts consumed are therefore overestimated.",1
"Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment protocols are evolving with frontline therapy now incorporates targeted immunotherapeutic agents. Targeted immune therapies like blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), rituximab, and nelarabine are being combined with traditional chemotherapy protocols to enhance remission rates and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity while decreasing toxicities. The incorporation of blinatumomab into initial treatment protocols for both Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph -) and positive (Ph +) ALL patients results in notable early MRD elimination. The medical use of InO as an initial treatment has increased specifically for older or medically unfit patients. The addition of rituximab to chemotherapy treatment in CD20-positive B-ALL patients produces superior long-term results. Adding nelarabine to pediatric-inspired T-cell ALL treatment protocols in young adult and adolescent (AYA) patients resulted in decrease their risk of central nervous system (CNS) relapse. High-risk ALL subtypes including Ph + and Ph-like ALL now receive immunotherapeutic and molecularly targeted treatments. Ph + ALL patients receive standard treatment with multi-agent chemotherapy and TKIs dasatinib or ponatinib and blinatumomab as part of their frontline therapy to enhance molecular responses and minimize the requirement for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). The combination of JAK inhibitors with ABL-class TKIs, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy represents current early-phase trial approaches for Ph-like ALL patients with kinase-activating alterations. The practice of testing MRD and genomic profiling at diagnosis revolutionized treatment approaches by allowing personalized curative strategies for all patients. Research on clinical trials aims to establish the best sequence of targeted therapies and CAR T-cell therapy for high-risk and MRD-positive patients to achieve longer survival rates with reduced toxicity and less dependence on allo-HCT in first remission.",0
"Phaseolus vulgaris is a foodstuff that not only supplies nutrients, but also bioactive compounds with antioxidant capacity; however, bad post-harvest storage or processing can diminish the antioxidant capacity. In this work, the effect of storage under extreme conditions, of thermal processing and of fermentation on the content of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant capacity (AA) in beans of just harvested P. vulgaris were evaluated. Combination of temperatures of 30 and 50°C and relative humidity of 11% and 80% for 150 days were evaluated. Extreme storage conditions drastically decreased the AA, demonstrating that post-harvest storage at low temperature and humidity preserves the antioxidant capacity of the beans. Regarding processing, cooking decreased the scavenging effect and the AA by 63.5% and 56.8%, while fermentation decreased them by only 14% and 22%, respectively. It was concluded that the loss of antioxidant capacity due to heating is less in fermented beans.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer among children, presenting significant healthcare challenges for some patients, including drug resistance and the need for targeted therapies. SiRNA-based therapy is one potential solution, but problems can arise in administration and the need for a delivery system to protect siRNA during intravenous injection. Additionally, siRNA encounters instability and degradation in the reticuloendothelial system, off-target effects, and potential immune system stimulation. Despite these limitations, some promising results about siRNA therapy in ALL patients have been published in recent years, showing the potential for more effective and precise treatment, reduced side effects, and personalized approaches. While siRNA-based therapies demonstrate safety and efficacy, addressing the mentioned limitations is crucial for further optimization. Advancements in siRNA-delivery technologies and combination therapies hold promise to improve treatment effectiveness and overcome drug resistance. Ultimately, despite its challenges, siRNA therapy has the potential to revolutionize ALL treatments and improve patient outcomes.",0
"Extracts of aromatic plants of Greek origin were examined as potential sources of phenolic compounds. RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed for the identification and quantification of the phenolic antioxidants, present in methanolic extracts. The most abundant phenolic acids were ferulic acid (1.1-280 mg/100 g of dry sample) and caffeic acid (1.2-60 mg/100 g of dry sample). (+)-Catechin and quercetin were the most abundant flavonoids. Apigenin and luteolin were detected in high amounts in Menta pulegium and Thymus vulgaris, respectively. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried ground plants and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and ranged from 1 to 21 mg of gallic acid/100 g of dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against selected microbes was also conducted in this study.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents the most common pediatric cancer. Most patients (85%) develop B-cell ALL; however, T-cell ALL tends to be more aggressive. We have previously identified 2B4 (SLAMF4), CS1 (SLAMF7) and LLT1 (CLEC2D) that can activate or inhibit NK cells upon the interaction with their ligands. In this study, the expression of 2B4, CS1, LLT1, NKp30 and NKp46 was determined. The expression profiles of these immune receptors were analyzed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of B-ALL and T-ALL subjects by single-cell RNA sequencing data obtained from the St. Jude PeCan data portal that showed increased expression of LLT1 in B-ALL and T-ALL subjects. Whole blood was collected from 42 pediatric ALL subjects at diagnosis and post-induction chemotherapy and 20 healthy subjects, and expression was determined at the mRNA and cell surface protein level. A significant increase in cell surface LLT1 expression in T cells, monocytes and NK cells was observed. Increased expression of CS1 and NKp46 was observed on monocytes of ALL subjects at diagnosis. A decrease of LLT1, 2B4, CS1 and NKp46 on T cells of ALL subjects was also observed post-induction chemotherapy. Furthermore, mRNA data showed altered expression of receptors in ALL subjects pre- and post-induction chemotherapy treatment. The results indicate that the differential expression of the receptors/ligand may play a role in the T-cell- and NK-cell-mediated immune surveillance of pediatric ALL.",0
"Low molecular weight phenolic compounds present in heat processed oats (Avena sativaL) were analysed. The oat grains were of three varieties (Kapp, Mustang and Svea), stored at different relative humidities (30, 55 or 80%) and periods (3·5 or 15·5 months) and processed with or without hulls. Eleven UV-absorbing compounds detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography were subjected to univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. The selected compounds included caffeic acid,p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, vanillic acid,p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin, coniferyl alcohol, three avenanthramides and one unidentified substance. The levels of vanillic acid, vanillin and, especially,p-coumaric acid,p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol increased significantly in samples processed with hulls, but not in samples processed without hulls. Ferulic acid increased in both processes, while caffeic acid and the avenanthramides were found to decrease during processing. Storage of unprocessed samples for 1 year generally increased the levels of phenolic acids and aldehydes. For the phenolic acids (except ferulic acid), this increase was most pronounced after storage at high relative humidity (80%). The avenanthramides were present at their highest levels in Mustang, caffeic acid in Svea and Mustang, the unidentified compound in Svea, while all the other compounds studied were present predominantly in the variety Kapp.",1
"The absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB) (690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 ± 90 μg (mean ± SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 ± 10.9 μg (mean ± SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.",1
"The concentration of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA) and its secoiridoid derivatives (3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA) in virgin olive oil decreased rapidly when the oil was repeatedly used for preparing french fries in deep-fat frying operations. At the end of the first frying process (10 min at 180 degrees C), the concentration of the dihydroxyphenol components was reduced to 50-60% of the original value, and after six frying operations only about 10% of the initial components remained. However, tyrosol (p-HPEA) and its derivatives (p-HPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EA) in the oil were much more stable during 12 frying operations. The reduction in their original concentration was much smaller than that for hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives and showed a roughly linear relationship with the number of frying operations. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract measured using the DPPH test rapidly diminished during the first six frying processes, from a total antioxidant activity higher than 740 micromol of Trolox/kg down to less than 250 micromol/kg. On the other hand, the concentration of polar compounds, oxidized triacylglycerol monomers (oxTGs), dimeric TGs, and polymerized TGs rapidly increased from the sixth frying operation onward, when the antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract was very low, and as a consequence the oil was much more susceptible to oxidation. The loss of antioxidant activity in the phenolic fraction due to deep-fat frying was confirmed by the storage oil and oil-in-water emulsions containing added extracts from olive oil used for 12 frying operations.",1
"Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) constitutes a distinctive cytogenetic entity associated with challenging outcomes, particularly in adult patients. Current upfront chemotherapy-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based therapies include first, second and third-generation TKIs that have revolutionized patient outcomes including molecular remission and overall survival. Chemotherapy-free regimens such as blinatumomab-dasatinib or blinatumomab-ponatinib offer exciting possibilities, yet challenges arise, particularly in preventing central nervous system relapse. Monitoring measurable residual disease is now a cornerstone particularly using next-generation sequencing (NGS)-Clonoseq for accurate assessment. Controversy regarding the ability to omit consolidation with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, specifically for patients achieving early molecular remission, is related to the excellent survival achieved with novel combinations in the upfront setting, however challenged by the lower disease control when transplant is utilized beyond first remission. Post-transplant maintenance introduces new dilemmas: the optimal TKI, dosing, and duration of therapy are open questions. Meanwhile, a myriad of new combinations and cellular therapies are used for relapsed Ph+ ALL, prompting us to unravel the optimal sequencing of these promising regimen. In this review, we delve into the breakthroughs and controversies in Ph+ ALL with ten commonly asked questions.",0
"Early T-cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ETP-ALL) is an immature subtype of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) commonly show deregulation of the LMO2-LYL1 stem cell transcription factors, activating mutations of cytokine receptor signaling, and poor early response to intensive chemotherapy. Previously, studies of the Lmo2 transgenic mouse model of ETP-ALL identified a population of stem-like T-cell progenitors with long-term self-renewal capacity and intrinsic chemotherapy resistance linked to cellular quiescence. Here, analyses of Lmo2 transgenic mice, patient-derived xenografts, and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from primary ETP-ALL identified a rare subpopulation of leukemic stem cells expressing high levels of the cytokine receptor FLT3. Despite a highly proliferative state, these FLT3-overexpressing cells had long-term self-renewal capacity and almost complete resistance to chemotherapy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing demonstrated FLT3 and its ligand may be direct targets of the LMO2 stem-cell complex. Media conditioned by Lmo2 transgenic thymocytes revealed an autocrine FLT3-dependent signaling loop that could be targeted by the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib. Consequently, gilteritinib impaired in vivo growth of ETP-ALL and improved the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, gilteritinib enhanced response to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, which may enable ""chemo-free"" treatment of ETP-ALL. Together, these data provide a cellular and molecular explanation for enhanced cytokine signaling in LMO2-driven ETP-ALL beyond activating mutations and a rationale for clinical trials of FLT3 inhibitors in ETP-ALL.",0
"Low-hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (LH-ALL) in both children and adults is characterized by biallelic TP53 alterations in virtually all cases. However, in contrast to a common germline origin of the TP53 mutations in pediatric cases, those in adult cases are mostly somatic and are derived from age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH), highlighting the role of TP53-mutant ARCH in the development not only of myeloid leukemogenesis but also of LH-ALL in aged populations. See related article by Kim et al., p. 134 (4).",0
"Maternal infection is common during pregnancy and is an important potential cause of fetal genetic and immunological abnormalities. Maternal infection has been reported to be associated with childhood leukemia in previous case-control or small cohort studies. To evaluate the association of maternal infection during pregnancy with childhood leukemia among offspring in a large study. This population-based cohort study used data from 7 Danish national registries (including the Danish Medical Birth Register, the Danish National Patient Registry, the Danish National Cancer Registry, and others) for all live births in Denmark between 1978 and 2015. Swedish registry data for all live births between 1988 and 2014 were used to validate the findings for the Danish cohort. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to December 2021. Maternal infection during pregnancy categorized by anatomic locations identified from the Danish National Patient Registry. The primary outcome was any leukemia; secondary outcomes were acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Offspring childhood leukemia was identified in the Danish National Cancer Registry. Associations were first assessed in the whole cohort using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. A sibling analysis was performed to account for unmeasured familial confounding. This study included 2 222 797 children, 51.3% of whom were boys. During the approximately 27 million person-years of follow-up (mean [SD], 12.0 [4.6] years per person), 1307 children were diagnosed with leukemia (ALL, 1050; AML, 165; or other, 92). Children born to mothers with infection during pregnancy had a 35% increased risk of leukemia (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.04-1.77]) compared with offspring of mothers without infection. Maternal genital and urinary tract infections were associated with a 142% and 65% increased risk of childhood leukemia, with HRs of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.50-3.92) and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.15-2.36), respectively. No association was observed for respiratory tract, digestive, or other infections. The sibling analysis showed comparable estimates to the whole-cohort analysis. The association patterns for ALL and AML were similar to that for any leukemia. No association was observed for maternal infection and brain tumors, lymphoma, or other childhood cancers. In this cohort study of approximately 2.2 million children, maternal genitourinary tract infection during pregnancy was associated with childhood leukemia among offspring. If confirmed in future studies, our findings may have implications for understanding the etiology and developing preventive measures for childhood leukemia.",0
"The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and cooking on the flavonoids and vitamin C content (ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acid; AA + DHAA) of fresh-cut spinach was evaluated. The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in MAP.",1

"Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.",1
"Phenolic acid contents were determined in seeds from five buckwheat cultivars grown at three locations in western Canada for four years. Buckwheat contained 12–16 g/kg of total phenolic acids, about 3 g/kg of esterified phenolic acids, and 8–13 g/kg of etherified phenolic acids. The latter represented 70 to 79% of the total phenolics. Variation in phenolic acids was mainly due to cultivar, seasonal effects and their interaction, while growing location had no significant effect. Phenolic acid contents of buckwheat were independent of seed color and protein content. Esterified phenolic acids exhibited a negative significant association with etherified phenolic acids in buckwheat.",1
"The effect of cooking and dehulling on nutrients and anti-nutritional factors of several varieties of lentils (Lens culinaris) was investigated. Significant (p<0.05) variations existed among the lentil varieties with respect to their crude protein, starch, ash, soluble dietary fiber (SDF), insoluble dietary fiber (IDF), total dietary fiber (TDF), resistant starch (RS), trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA), minerals, phytic acid, tannins, sucrose and oligosaccharides (raffinose, stachyose and verbascose) content. Cooking lentils in boiling water significantly increased protein, starch, IDF, TDF, resistant starch, Ca, Cu and Mn content, whereas reduced ash, Fe, K, Mg, P, Zn, TIA, phytic acid, tannins, sucrose and oligosaccharides were observed. Dehulling (removal of seed coat) resulted in a significant increase in protein, starch, resistant starch, K, P, phytic acid, stachyose and verbascose content, however, a significant decrease in SDF, IDF, TDF, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn and tannin content was observed.",1
"Our group has shown in a phase II clinical trial that pomegranate juice (PJ) increases prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in prostate cancer (CaP) patients with a rising PSA. Ellagitannins (ETs) are the most abundant polyphenols present in PJ and contribute greatly towards its reported biological properties. On consumption, ETs hydrolyze to release ellagic acid (EA), which is then converted by gut microflora to 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b, d]pyran-6-one (urolithin A, UA) derivatives. Despite the accumulating knowledge of ET metabolism in animals and humans, there is no available data on the pharmacokinetics and tissue disposition of urolithins. Using a standardized ET-enriched pomegranate extract (PE), we sought to further define the metabolism and tissue distribution of ET metabolites. PE and UA (synthesized in our laboratory) were administered to C57BL/6 wild-type male mice, and metabolite levels in plasma and tissues were determined over 24 h. ET metabolites were concentrated at higher levels in mouse prostate, colon, and intestinal tissues as compared to other tissues after administration of PE or UA. We also evaluated the effects of PE on CaP growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice injected subcutaneously with human CaP cells (LAPC-4). PE significantly inhibited LAPC-4 xenograft growth in SCID mice as compared to vehicle control. Finally, EA and several synthesized urolithins were shown to inhibit the growth of human CaP cells in vitro. The chemopreventive potential of pomegranate ETs and localization of their bioactive metabolites in mouse prostate tissue suggest that pomegranate may play a role in CaP treatment and chemoprevention. This warrants future human tissue bioavailability studies and further clinical studies in men with CaP.",1
"Blood orange juice has a high content in anthocyanins, especially represented by delphinidin-3-glucoside (D3G), cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and cyanidin-3-(6-malonylglucoside) (CMG). An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of D3G and C3G in human plasma and urine was developed and validated. After sample preparation by SPE, chromatographic separation was performed with an RP-C(18) column, using a water/methanol linear gradient. The quantitation of target compounds was determined by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, using ESI. The method showed good selectivity, sensitivity (LOD = 0.05 and 0.10 ng/mL for C3G in plasma and urine, respectively; LOD = 0.10 ng/mL for D3G in plasma and urine), linearity (0.20-200 ng/mL; r >or= 0.998), intra- and interday precision and accuracy (<or= 14.6%) and satisfactory recoveries (80.0-110.4%) for the target compounds in both plasma and urine. Stability of analytes in plasma and urine has been investigated in detail. This method was successfully applied to the determination of D3G, C3G and CMG levels in human plasma and urine after the ingestion of a single dose (500 mL) of blood orange juice.",1
The juices from 39 strawberry genotypes were analysed for anthocyanin composition and colour characteristics. No single cultivar or breeding line possessed the innate pigment characteristics thought to confer greater colour stability on strawberry juices but the anthocyanin patterns were far more complex than hitherto reported in strawberries. Thirteen different peaks were observed during high-performance liquid chromatography of the juices and tentative identifications are proposed for two previously unidentified strawberry anthocyanins. The occurrence of pelargonidin 3-rutinoside was confirmed. Colour quality measurements derived from CIELAB L*a*b* values are reported for the fresh juices.,1
"Muscadine grape juice will occasionally produce a sediment upon standing for long time periods. In order to seek approaches to elimination of this sediment, it was necessary first to identify it and then to quantitate the material responsible. The sediment was identified through various chemical and spectrophotometric means as ellagic acid. This material could be separated, identified, and quantitated in juice by using HPLC. A simple spectrophotometric assay also sufficed for quantitation. Different juice sources contained highly variable amounts of ellagic acid.",1
"Obecabtagene autoleucel (obe-cel) is an autologous 41BB-ζ anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy which uses an intermediate-affinity CAR to reduce toxic effects and improve persistence. We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study of obe-cel in adults (≥18 years of age) with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The main cohort, cohort 2A, included patients with morphologic disease; patients in cohort 2B had measurable residual disease. The primary end point was overall remission (complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) in cohort 2A. Secondary end points included event-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Of the 153 enrolled patients, 127 (83.0%) received at least one infusion of obe-cel and were evaluable. In cohort 2A (94 patients; median follow-up, 20.3 months), overall remission occurred in 77% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 85), with complete remission in 55% (95% CI, 45 to 66) and complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery in 21% (95% CI, 14 to 31). The prespecified null hypotheses of overall remission (≤40%) and complete remission (≤20%) were rejected (P<0.001). In the 127 patients who received at least one obe-cel infusion (median follow-up, 21.5 months), the median event-free survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 8.0 to 22.1); estimated 6- and 12-month event-free survival was 65.4% and 49.5%, respectively. The median overall survival was 15.6 months (95% CI, 12.9 to not evaluable); estimated 6- and 12-month overall survival was 80.3% and 61.1%, respectively. Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome developed in 2.4% of the patients, and grade 3 or higher immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome developed in 7.1% of the patients. Obe-cel resulted in a high incidence of durable response among adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL, with a low incidence of grade 3 or higher immune-related toxic effects.

"The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl (350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant (125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially rich in phenolics.",1
"Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.",1
"Commonly used spices (40) in cooking and therapeutic preparations in India were evaluated for antioxidant activity (AOA), total phenols and flavonoids in raw and cooked in open (5 min, 1:10, 100°C). Among these spices, AOA was highest for white mustard (91.6%) followed by black mustard (91.0%) while the total phenols (141 mg/g) and flavonoids (60 mg) were highest in clove. The results revealed a significant reduction in AOA, polyphenols and flavonoids contents on cooking of large number of spices.",1
"The technique of αβ T cell depletion (αβTCD) is a well-established method of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for children with acute leukemia owing to the low rates of graft-versus-host disease and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). The graft-versus-leukemia effect is generally ascribed to natural killer (NK) cells conserved within the graft. It is not known whether NK-related factors affect the outcome of αβTCD HSCT, however. The aim of this retrospective study was to explore the impact of NK alloreactivity (based on donor-recipient killer immunoglobulin-like receptor [KIR] mismatch), graft NK cell dose, and blood NK cell recovery on day +30 post-HSCT on the incidences of leukemia relapse and NRM. The pediatric acute leukemia cohort comprised 295 patients who underwent their first HSCT from a haploidentical donor in complete remission. During post hoc analysis, the total cohort was divided into subcohorts by diagnosis (acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]/acute myeloid leukemia [AML]), NK alloreactivity prediction (KIR match/KIR mismatch), graft NK cell dose (less than versus greater than the median value), and blood NK cell recovery on day +30 post-HSCT (less than versus greater than the median value). We also investigated the influence of serotherapy (antithymocyte globulin [ATG] group) versus abatacept + tocilizumab combination [aba+toci] group) on relapse risk in the context of KIR mismatch. The risks of relapse and NRM were calculated by the cumulative risk method, and groups were compared using the Gray test. Multivariate analysis revealed no apparent impact of predicted NK alloreactivity or any other studied NK cell-related factors for the entire cohort. For patients with AML, a significantly higher relapse risk associated with high NK cell graft content on the background of no predicted KIR mismatch (P = .002) was shown. Multivariate analysis confirmed this finding (P = .018); on the other hand, for the KIR-mismatched patients, there was a trend toward a lower risk of relapse associated with high NK cell dose. The use of ATG was associated with a trend toward reduced relapse risk (P = .074) in the AML patients. There was no significant impact of NK-related factors in the ALL patients. Overall, the evaluated NK-related factors did not show a clear and straightforward correlation with the key outcomes of HSCT in our cohort of children with acute leukemia. In practice, the data support prioritization of KIR-mismatched donors for patients with AML. Importantly, a potential interaction of KIR ligand mismatch and NK cell content in the graft was identified. Indirect evidence suggests that additional cellular constituents of the graft could influence the function of NK cells after HSCT and affect their role as graft-versus-leukemia effectors.",0
"This paper describes the simultaneous determination of catechins and theaflavins in green and black teas, using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). The tea polyphenols analyzed included (+)-catechin, catechin gallate, (-)-epicatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, theaflavin, theaflavin-3-monogallate, theaflavin-3'-monogallate and theaflavin-3,3'-gallate. These polyphenols together with six other tea ingredients such as caffeine, adenine, theophylline, quercetin, gallic acid and caffeic acid were separated within 27 min by HPLC and in less than 10 min by CE. The optimal analytical conditions of both chromatographic methods were investigated for the convenience and reliability for routine analysis. Both HPLC and CE were found to be reliable and compatible. The reproducibility of the within-day assay using both methods was generally >90%. The day-to-day variation of retention time was <5% for HPLC, while the variation of migration time for CE was <2%. The analysis time of CE was three-times faster, however it is five-times less sensitive than HPLC, which has detection limits of 0.05 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml for catechins and theaflavins, respectively.",1
"The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 +/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 ). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and other diseases.",1
"The content of potentially antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antiallergic flavonoid aglycons, quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin and luteolin of 45 fruits were determined by RP-HPLC with UV detection. Fresh and dried fruits were purchased in the local markets in Budapest at a period of their most frequent consumption. Total flavonoid content of fruits varied between 0–1000 mg kg –1, the average concentration was about 30 mg kg –1 fresh weight. Quercetin could be detected in most fruits, namely in apples, pear, plums, sweet and sour cherry and berries between 10–53 mg kg –1. Luteolin at a concentration of 20 mg kg –1 was found in melons, apples, kiwi and lemon. Myricetin was in detectable amount in redcurrant, and at very high concentration in some berry fruits (mulberry 453 mg kg –1, raspberry 540 mg kg –1, blackberry 636 mg kg –1, strawberry 994 mg kg –1), and in walnut (4565 mg kg –1). Kaempferol and apigenin were not found in the fruits investigated. None of the five flavonoids was found in some variety of grapes, in peach, pear, banana, orange, grapefruit and tangerine, in nuts such as almond, pistachio, nuts, and in dried fruits such as raisin, date, fig and prunes. These data provide a basis for the evaluation of the average daily intake of Hungarian population and for an epidemiological evaluation of health-promoting effects of flavonoids.",1
"Cocoa seeds and pulp were fermented for 144 h, followed by natural drying. The tegument was removed and the cotyledons were broken into nibs which were roasted at 150 °C for 30 min. Non-fermented material, material fermented for 24, 48 and 72 h, material fermented for 144 h and then dried, and also the roasted nibs, were all prepared for chemical and microscopic analyses. Light microscopy revealed the presence of anionic and cationic residues and of neutral sugars. During fermentation there was a reduction in the cytoplasmic content of phenolic compounds and in the number of protein bodies. The cell wall showed a reduction in anionic residues and a loss of crystallinity. These alterations were maximum after 72 h. Drying and roasting increased the number of damaged cells and reduced the amount of cytoplasmic material. The chemical analyses generally confirmed the microscopy results. The concentration of amino-terminal groups and total free amino acids increased during fermentation (up to 72 h), but returned to the initial values after roasting. The principal chemical changes were related to reducing sugars, free amino acids, proteins and phenols, and PCA was suggested as a useful tool to compare different samples. Microscopic analysis revealed the degradation of protein and phenolic bodies and cellular damage during roasting.",1
"Of all plant constituents, coffee has one of the highest concentrations of chlorogenic acids. When roasting coffee, some of these are transformed into chlorogenic acid lactones (CGL). We have studied the formation of CGL during the roasting of coffee beans in Coffea arabica cv. Bourbon; C. arabicacv. Longberry; and C. canephora cv. Robusta. Individual CGL levels were determined by comparison of HPLC peaks with those of synthetic CGL standards. Seven CGL were identified: 3-caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-CQL), 4- caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-CQL), 3-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-pCoQL), 4-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-pCoQL), 3-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-FQL), 4-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-FQL), and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-diCQL). 3-CQL was the most abundant lactone in C. arabica and C. canephora, reaching peak values of 230 +/- 9 and 254 +/- 4 mg/100 g (dry weight), respectively, at light medium roast ( approximately 14% weight loss). 4-CQL was the second most abundant lactone (116 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 mg/100 g, respectively. The maximum amount of CGL represents approximately 30% of the available precursors. The relative levels of 3-CQL and 4-CQL in roasted coffee were reverse to those of their precursors in green coffee. This suggests that roasting causes isomerization of chlorogenic acids prior to the formation of lactones and that the levels of lactones in roasted coffee do not reflect the levels of precursors in green coffee.",1
"The discharge process is a crucial component of the emergency department (ED) encounter, with poor discharge quality often leading to negative patient outcomes. While numerous interventions have been implemented to improve this process, a comprehensive review of these interventions has not been conducted. This study provides a scoping, summative review of adult ED discharge interventions to date, evaluating the literature for potential best practices and future directions. We conducted a scoping review of published literature on MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Wiley), and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) on February 7, 2023, for articles reporting on ED-based discharge interventions. We excluded the following: studies involving pediatric patient populations; discharge from non-ED settings; in-ED risk screening and/or case management as the primary intervention; interventions occurring mostly after the ED encounter (even if initiated at time of discharge); and studies not written in English. The initial electronic database search yielded 3,842 unique titles and abstracts. After applying inclusion/exclusion criteria at various screening stages, we included 100 papers and abstracts in the final review. These studies, published between 2003 - 2023, predominantly originated from the US (66%). Using narrative synthesis, we summarized ED discharge intervention themes to form seven concept subgroups by consensus: mode of discharge; additional resource provision; addition of a discharge coordinator; follow-up assistance; pharmaceutical intervention; patient-centered education; and clinician/discharger-centered education. Effective strategies included enhanced discharge discussions and education by dedicated personnel, structured discharge checklists, and delivery of instructions at an appropriate reading level. However, because few studies have examined long-term patient-centered outcomes, such as ED return visits, hospitalizations, and mortality, cost-benefit analysis for interventions is lacking. Furthermore, the experiences of vulnerable populations who have limited-English proficiency are under-represented in current attempts to innovate ED discharge. We found that interventions aimed at improving patient comprehension of discharge instructions were the most frequently studied and had the greatest impact on patient outcomes. This review highlights promising directions for patient-centered innovation; it also underscores the need for more research to optimize the adult ED discharge process and warrants a call to action.",0
"A 67-year-old woman presented to a chiropractor with a four-week history of neck and low back pain, lower extremity paresthesia, profound fatigue, and cutaneous pallor. Previous cervical radiographs had revealed multilevel degenerative spondylosis. However, abnormal hematological indices, including severe thrombocytopenia and anemia, prompted concerns of an underlying hematopoietic malignancy. Interdisciplinary collaboration facilitated expedient hematological assessment, confirming acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as evidenced by lymphoblasts in a peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy. Karyotyping detected a Philadelphia chromosomal mutation; the patient therefore received oral targeted tyrosine kinase inhibition coupled with serial intrathecal chemotherapy. Complete remission was achieved. However, sensorimotor symptoms persisted due to herpetic neuralgia secondary to immunosuppression. This complex case underscores the role of chiropractors as primary contact clinicians in identifying sinister pathologies underlying musculoskeletal complaints via judicious history-taking, physical evaluation, and interpretation of investigational findings. Interprofessional collaboration is pivotal in formulating an effective therapeutic strategy to improve the prognosis of patients with this disease.",0
"This study presents the phenolic compounds profile of commercial Cornicabra virgin olive oils from five successive crop seasons (1995/1996 to 1999/2000; n = 97), determined by solid phase extraction reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (SPE RP-HPLC), and its relationship with oxidative stability, processing conditions, and a preliminary study on variety classification. The median of total phenols content was 38 ppm (as syringic acid), although a wide range was observed, from 11 to 76 ppm. The main phenols found were the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol (p-HPEA-EDA; 9 +/- 7 ppm, as median and interquartile range), oleuropein aglycon (8 +/- 6 ppm), and the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA; 5 +/- 8 ppm). In many cases the correlation with oxidative stability was higher when the sum of the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) and oleuropein aglycon (r (2) = 0.91-0.96) or the sum of these two and hydroxytyrosol (r (2) = 0.90-0.97) was considered than was observed with HPLC total phenols (r (2)= 0.91-0.95) and especially with colorimetric determination of total polyphenols and o-diphenols (r (2) = 0.77-0.95 and 0.78-0.92, respectively). 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, the aglycons of oleuropein and ligstroside, and HPLC total phenols content presented highly significant differences (p = 0.001-0.010) with respect to the dual- and triple-phase extraction systems used, whereas colorimetric total polyphenols content did not (p = 0.348) and o-diphenols showed a much lower significant difference (p = 0.031). The five variables that most satisfactorily classified the principal commercial Spanish virgin olive oil varieties were 1-acetoxypinoresinol, 4-(acetoxyethyl)-1,2-dihydroxybenzene (3,4-DHPEA-AC), ligstroside aglycon, p-HPEA-EDA, and RT 43.3 contents.",1

"Phenolic acids from 30 barley varieties (combination of hulled/hulless/two-row/six-row/regular/waxy) were investigated by HPLC following four different sample treatments: (a) simple hot water extraction, (b) extraction after acid hydrolysis, (c) acid plus alpha-amylase hydrolysis, and (d) acid plus alpha-amylase plus cellulase hydrolysis treatments. The benzoic acid (p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and protocatechuic acids) and cinnamic acid derivatives (coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and chlorogenic acids) were identified, and some of the phenolic acids were quantified after each above-mentioned treatment. The data indicated that a combination of sequential acid, alpha-amylase, and cellulase hydrolysis treatments might be applicable for release of more phenolic acids from barley.",1
"The effect of methotrexate (MTX)-related toxicity on childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is controversial. Hence, this meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between ABCB1 C3435 T polymorphism- and methotrexate-related toxicity in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Relevant studies were systematically searched and extracted from multiple databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases up to 1 June, 2024. A total of 13 articles met the criteria, including 1506 patients. The results showed that ABCB1 C3435 T polymorphism was significantly associated with MTX-induced hepatotoxicity (CT/TT vs. CC: OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.40-3.32). There was no significant difference between ABCB1 C3435 T polymorphism and mucositis, myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity in pediatric ALL treated with MTX. Our meta-analysis suggests that the ABCB1 C3435 T mutation may enhance the MTX-induced hepatotoxicity in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",0
"Data describing the risk factors for the occurrence of severe infections in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients following induction chemotherapy and the role of prophylactic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the era of antimicrobials prophylaxis are limited. This study enrolled 188 children aged ≤18 years with newly diagnosed ALL who received Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group ALL-2002 and 2013 treatments between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2021. Prophylactic G-CSF was administered when a patient continues neutropenia after achieving the first bone marrow remission since June 1, 2015. Clinical factors were assessed for their association with severe infections. From January 2010 to May 2015, 80 children experienced a total of 11 (13.5%) episodes of severe infections; while 10 (9.2%) episodes were reported to occur in 108 patients who received prophylactic G-CSF. Reduction of severe infections occurrence did not achieve statistical significance during prophylactic G-CSF administration in ALL patients. Compared with ALL-high risk (HR) and very high risk patients with no G-CSF prophylaxis, the use of G-CSF prophylaxis significantly reduced episodes of febrile neutropenia. Occurrence of grade III-IV intestinal ileus, grade II-III oral mucositis, prolonged neutropenia, central venous catheter (CVC) placement, or the requirement insulin therapy for hyperglycemia were associated with higher risk of bloodstream infections. ALL-HR patients with G-CSF prophylaxis were associated with reduction of febrile neutropenia episodes. Occurrence of severe ileus, oral mucositis, hyperglycemia, CVC placement, or prolonged neutropenia were associated with severe infections in ALL patients receiving induction chemotherapy.",0
"The nutrients, non-nutritional components and bioactive compounds, as well as the antioxidant capacity of raw, cooked, tray and drum-dried Phaseolus lunatus have been quantified. Likewise, the minerals, soluble carbohydrates, total polyphenols and tannins in the soaking and cooking waters were quantified. In addition, the functional properties such as the water and oil absorption indexes and the emulsifying and the foaming capacities were studied. The protein content of the raw beans was 24.98% and decreased, like calcium, magnesium and potassium, with the soaking and cooking processes; these losses are found in the soaking and cooking waters. Drum drying decreased anti-nutritional factors like trypsin inhibitors (66.09%) and cyanhydric acid (50.36%). Similarly, soluble fiber, available starch, total starch, and soluble sugars diminished, while total and insoluble fiber and resistant starch increased. The content of total polyphenols, tannins and antioxidant capacity decreased with thermal processing, being drum drying the process that least diminished antioxidant capacity. Likewise, the water absorption index was increased by 85% and 161.5% with processing. It was shown that P. lunatus is an important source of nutrients and can be consumed in whole bean form or used as a functional ingredient to be added in the development of new products.",1
"High-grade knee laxity and excessive anterior tibial subluxation (ATS) are correlated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency and share similar risk factors; however, the association between excessive ATS and high-grade knee laxity remains unclear. To identify the association between excessive ATS and high-grade knee laxity in patients with ACL deficiency and determine the possibility that ATS can predict high-grade knee laxity. Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. A total of 226 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between May 2018 and March 2022 were analyzed in the present study; the high-grade group consisted of 113 patients who had a grade 3 result on the preoperative anterior drawer test, Lachman test, or pivot-shift test while under anesthesia, and the low-grade group consisted of 113 matched patients. The ATS values for medial and lateral compartments (ATSMC and ATSLC) were measured on magnetic resonance imaging while patients relaxed the quadriceps in the supine position under no anesthesia. The optimal cutoff values of ATSMC and ATSLC for high-grade knee laxity were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with stratification were performed to identify the association between excessive ATS and high-grade knee laxity. Compared with the low-grade group, the high-grade group had a longer time from injury to surgery; higher rates of medial meniscus posterior horn tear (MMPHT), lateral meniscus posterior horn tear (LMPHT), and anterolateral ligament (ALL) abnormality; and larger lateral tibial slope, ATSMC, and ATSLC. The optimal cutoff value was 2.6 mm (sensitivity, 52.2%; specificity, 76.1%) for ATSMC and 4.5 mm (sensitivity, 67.3%; specificity, 64.6%) for ATSLC in predicting high-grade knee laxity. After adjustment for covariates, ATSLC ≥4.5 mm (odds ratio [OR], 2.94; 95% CI, 1.56-5.55; Excessive ATSLC was associated with high-grade knee laxity in patients who had ACL deficiency, with a predictive cutoff value of 4.5 mm. This study may help surgeons estimate the degree of knee instability more accurately before anesthesia and may facilitate preliminary surgical decision-making, such as appropriate graft choices and consideration of extra-articular augmentation.",0
"With the rising survival rate among children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), prioritizing patient-centered care to address the long-term effects of chemotherapy through tailored rehabilitation interventions is essential for optimizing their quality of life. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of an 8-week intervention using adaptive variable-resistance training (Adaptive-VRT) on chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia, fatigue, and functional restrictions in pediatric survivors of ALL. A prospective randomized controlled trial included a total of 62 survivors of ALL, aged 12-18 years, and completed maintenance chemotherapy. Participants were randomized into two groups: the Adaptive-VRT group (n = 31), assigned the Adaptive-VRT intervention, and the control group (n = 31), which adhered to the standard exercise protocol. Baseline and post-intervention measurements were undertaken to analyze sarcopenia-related variables (i.e., muscle thickness and muscle strength), fatigue, and functional performance. The Adaptive-VRT group exhibited more favorable changes in muscle thickness [thigh thickness (P < .001; η The findings suggest that Adaptive-VRT is a promising intervention for ameliorating chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia, fatigue, and functional limitations in pediatric ALL survivors.

"Flaxseed oils currently sold on the worldwide market are not governed by specific standards or specifications. In this study, the physicochemical and quality characteristics of seven cold-pressed flaxseed oils sold in New Zealand have been analyzed. General regulations and specification for edible vegetable oils and cold-pressed oils were used as a guide. Fatty acid composition, tocopherol composition, moisture and volatile matter content, free fatty acids, chlorophyll pigments, total phenolic acids, total flavanoids, acid value, unsaponifiable matter, peroxide value, conjugated dienoic acids, p-anisidine value and specific extinction in the ultraviolet spectrum of the flaxseed oils were measured. Color and dielectric measurement of the flaxseed oils were also estimated using a spectrocolorimeter and a food oil sensor, respectively. The physicochemical characteristics of the flaxseed oils were found to be quite similar with only a few significant variations. Four out of the seven flaxseed oils passed all the quality tests conducted in this study.",1
"The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant components and activities.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) are rare aggressive hematologic malignancies. Current treatment consists of intensive chemotherapy leading to 80% overall survival but is associated with severe toxic side effects. Furthermore, 10-20% of patients still die from relapsed or refractory disease providing a strong rationale for more specific, targeted therapeutic strategies with less toxicities. Here, we report a novel MYH9::PDGFRB fusion in a T-LBL patient, and demonstrate that this fusion product is constitutively active and sufficient to drive oncogenic transformation in vitro and in vivo. Expanding our analysis more broadly across T-ALL, we found a T-ALL cell line and multiple patient-derived xenograft models with PDGFRB hyperactivation in the absence of a fusion, with high PDGFRB expression in TLX3 and HOXA T-ALL molecular subtypes. To target this PDGFRB hyperactivation, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of a selective PDGFRB inhibitor, CP-673451, both in vitro and in vivo and demonstrated sensitivity if the receptor is hyperactivated. Altogether, our work reveals that hyperactivation of PDGFRB is an oncogenic driver in T-ALL/T-LBL, and that screening T-ALL/T-LBL patients for phosphorylated PDGFRB levels can serve as a biomarker for PDGFRB inhibition as a novel targeted therapeutic strategy in their treatment regimen.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant condition of lymphoid progenitor cells that primarily affects the pediatric population, but also adults. The 5-year survival rate is 90% in children and approximately 40% in adults, with survival increasing through the use of peripheral stem cell allotransplantation (SCT). The relapse rate after stem cell transplantation (SCT) in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients ranges from 35% to 45%, making relapse a major cause of death in this population.",0
"Flavonoids continue to attract wide attention as possible very useful agents for combating free radical pathologies, i.e. the pathological states associated with free radical overproduction. Commonly used methods for the analysis of plant flavonoids include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). On the other hand, the soft-ionization approach based on electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) permits highly selective analysis of complex matrices. In this work, we examined firstly the ESI-MS behaviour of representative aglycones and glycosides of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones with the aim of suggesting a possible relationship between structure and mass spectra. Using HPLC coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) for on-line UV spectra acquisition, and in parallel to ESI-MS for mass spectra (LC/DAD-ESI-MS), we have developed methodology to observe flavonols directly in tomato puree extract. In this way, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides in tomato extracts and to characterize a flavonol trisaccharide. For the first time, using LC/ESI-MS, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides in plasma of healthy volunteers and to provide further evidence on the absorption of flavonoid glycosides after consumption of common vegetables like tomatoes.",1
"Laparoscopic training remains inaccessible for surgeons in low- and middle-income countries, limiting its widespread adoption. We developed a novel tool for assessment of laparoscopic appendectomy skills through ALL-SAFE, a low-cost laparoscopy training system. This pilot study in Ethiopia, Cameroon, and the USA assessed appendectomy skills using the ALL-SAFE training system. Performance measures were captured using the ALL-SAFE verification of proficiency tool (APPY-VOP), consisting of a checklist, modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (m-OSATS), and final rating. Twenty participants, including novice (n = 11), intermediate (n = 8), and expert (n = 1), completed an online module covering appendicitis management and psychomotor skills in laparoscopic appendectomy. After viewing an expert skills demonstration video, participants recorded their performance within ALL-SAFE. Using the APPY-VOP, participants rated their own and three peer videos. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test and a Many-Facet Rasch Model to evaluate (i) capacity of APPY-VOP to differentiate performance levels, (ii) correlation among three APPY-VOP components, and (iii) rating differences across groups. Checklist scores increased from novice (M = 21.02) to intermediate (M = 23.64) and expert (M = 28.25), with differentiation between experts and novices, P = 0.005. All five m-OSATS domains and global summed, total summed, and final rating discriminated across all performance levels (P < 0.001). APPY-VOP final ratings adequately discriminated Competent (M = 2.0), Borderline (N = 1.8), and Not Competent (M = 1.4) performances, Χ APPY-VOP effectively discriminated between novice and expert performance in laparoscopic appendectomy skills in a simulated setting. Scoring alignment across raters suggests consistent evaluation, independent of expertise. These results support the use of APPY-VOP among all skill levels inside a peer rating system. Future studies will focus on correlating proficiency to clinical practice and scaling ALL-SAFE to other settings.",0
"The present study was undertaken to determine the degree of any relationship between the theoretical and the experimentally determined tannin content in common beans. With this objective, theoretical tannin content was calculated as a function of seed coat tannin content and seed coat percentage weight in 19 varieties of common beans, grown in two localities of the Mexican highlands. The percentage of undetected tannins was calculated by the difference for all cultivars. The theoretical tannin content was correlated with the tannins detected experimentally in whole bean flour. The undetectable tannins ranged from 9.9 to 66.4% for varieties grown in Aguascalientes, and from 4.1 to 69.7% for cultivars harvested in Durango. A significant positive correlation was observed between the values of the theoretical tannin content and tannins detected experimentally in cultivars from Aguascalientes (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) and Durango (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). Nevertheless, there were many examples that showed the real content of tannins to have been underestimated. In accordance with this study, it is propose that, in order to obtain the real content of tannins of beans, these compounds should be determined in the seed coat flour.",1
"Fruits and vegetables in the diet have been found in epidemiology studies to be protective against several chronic diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that flavonoid consumption in the diet is protective against heart disease. Phenols in 23 vegetables have been measured by extraction with and without acid hydrolysis to determine the percent of conjugated and free phenols. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using the Folin−Ciocalteu reagent with catechin as the standard. The extracts' antioxidant quality was assayed by the inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation mediated by cupric ions. Vegetables had antioxidant quality comparable to that of pure flavonols and were superior to vitamin antioxidants. The phenol antioxidant index, measuring both the quantity and the quality of antioxidants present, was used to evaluate 23 vegetables. Isolated lower density lipoproteins from plasma spiked with two vegetable extracts were enriched with phenol antioxidants and showed decreased oxidizability. The average per capita consumption of vegetable phenols in the United States was estimated to be 218 mg/day of catechin equivalents. This is 3 times higher than the recommended intake of vitamin antioxidants.",1
"We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of decitabine consolidation after treatment with CD19/CD22 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (r/r B-ALL). We retrospectively analysed 48 patients with r/r B-ALL who received CD19/CD22 CAR-T therapy between September 2017 and May 2021. Sixteen patients received decitabine consolidation (20 mg/m The median follow-up periods in the DAC and CON groups were 41.2 months and 28.6 months, respectively. The 4-year OS and 4-year LFS rates in both groups were 93.3 % and 64.3 % (P=0.029) and 87.5 % and 55.9 % (P=0.059), respectively. The 1-year CIR was 6.25 % and 28.6 %, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that decitabine consolidation after CAR-T therapy was significantly associated with superior OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.121, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.015-0.947, P=0.044), and bridging to haematopoietic stem cell transplantation after CAR-T therapy was significantly associated with superior LFS (HR: 0.279, 95 %CI: 0.093-0.840, P=0.023).

"Successful treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) requires multiagent chemotherapy regimens and central nervous system prophylaxis, including intrathecal methotrexate. Although acute symptomatic seizures can occur during ALL treatment, epilepsy is less common. Furthermore, drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) is rare, presenting with two phenotypes: focal epilepsy, such as temporal lobe, or epileptic encephalopathies (EE), such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). For ALL survivors, the development of DRE has significant impact on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. We describe four patients with ALL remission, who developed EEs, of which 3 had LGS. Mean age at ALL diagnosis was 1.9 years; range 1.1-2.5 years. All, but one, had normal development prior to ALL. No patient had CNS leukemic involvement. All patients received CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal methotrexate, without cranial radiotherapy. Three had symptomatic methotrexate neurotoxicity during treatment. The mean age at first seizure was 5.6 years; range 3.9-7.5 years, with a mean latency of 3.7 years from ALL diagnosis. All patients developed drug resistant EEs, moderate intellectual disability, and neuropsychiatric co-morbidities. Two patients had a minimal response to corpus callosotomy (CC), and one did not respond the ketogenic diet. Successful treatment of childhood ALL is rarely associated with the development of DRE and EEs. Young age at ALL diagnosis (<3 years) may be a predisposing factor. Palliative treatments, including ketogenic diet and CC have limited benefit in these patients. Individual genetic susceptibility to MTX toxicity is likely related to epileptogenesis, and further research is required for epilepsy biomarkers.",0
"Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPCs) are known to have an active role in maintaining healthy vessel anatomy and function. The purpose of the present study was to quantify cEPCs in childhood cancer survivors after treatment completion and evaluate possible associations of their levels with metabolic disorders. Circulating EPCs isolated from peripheral blood samples from 383 children and adolescent cancer survivors diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphomas, or solid tumors (ST) were quantified 1, 3, and more than 3 years after treatment completion using flow cytometry. Their levels were compared to 200 healthy controls, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to seek correlations with metabolic disorders, including hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. The levels of CD34 Significant differences in cEPC levels were observed in childhood cancer survivors during the first year after treatment completion, which were comparable to healthy controls after 3 years post-treatment.",0
"Children and youth who are uninsured or underinsured in Canada and the USA have limited options where they can receive healthcare. In both countries, community health centres (CHCs) have been established as a solution to provide quality care to children without adequate insurance, including those who are newcomers or refugees. However, little is known about how well these models deliver paediatric care. Cross-country analysis provides an important viewpoint to identify areas of success and growth. The purpose of this scoping review is to compare quality of care for uninsured and underinsured children through CHCs in the USA and Canada. This scoping review follows the methodological guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence synthesis. The protocol has been registered with the Open Science Framework Registries and can be accessed online. A search will be conducted in electronic databases of peer-reviewed literature (Ovid MEDLINE ALL, CINAHL Complete via EbscoHost, Scopus; Health Business Elite via EbscoHost and Sociological Abstracts via ProQuest) as well as the grey literature. Two reviewers will review all titles and abstracts for inclusion in full-text review. Studies that meet inclusion criteria will be included in full-text review. Data will be extracted into Covidence, using the Donabedian model as a conceptual framework. Findings will be synthesised in a narrative format. As this study only uses publicly available data, ethics approval is not required. Findings will be shared at national and international conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal. In addition, findings will be prepared into a policy brief or white paper to be shared with relevant policy stakeholders to advocate for a better model of care for marginalised children and youth.",0
"Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.",1
"Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that are widely distributed in fruit, vegetables, and red wines. Anthocyanin products are also prescribed as medicines in many countries for treating various diseases. However, the pharmacokinetics of dietary anthocyanins are not known in humans because these glycosides were long considered nonabsorbable.",1
"Tremendous strides have been made in the molecular and cytogenetic classification of acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on gene expression profiling data, leading to an expansion of entities in the recent International Consensus Classification (ICC) of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias and 2022 WHO Classification of Tumours: Haematolymphoid Tumors, 5th edition. This increased diagnostic and therapeutic complexity can be overwhelming, and this review compares nomenclature differences between the ICC and WHO 5th edition publications, compiles key features of each entity, and provides a diagnostic algorithmic approach. In covering B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we divided the entities into established (those present in the revised 4th edition WHO) and novel (those added to either the ICC or WHO 5th edition) groups. The established B-ALL entities include B-ALL with BCR::ABL1 fusion, BCR::ABL1-like features, KMT2A rearrangement, ETV6::RUNX1 rearrangement, high hyperdiploidy, hypodiploidy (focusing on near haploid and low hypodiploid), IGH::IL3 rearrangement, TCF3::PBX1 rearrangement, and iAMP21. The novel B-ALL entities include B-ALL with MYC rearrangement; DUX4 rearrangement; MEF2D rearrangement; ZNF384 or ZNF362 rearrangement, NUTM1 rearrangement; HLF rearrangement; UBTF::ATXN7L3/PAN3,CDX2; mutated IKZF1 N159Y; mutated PAX5 P80R; ETV6::RUNX1-like features; PAX5 alteration; mutated ZEB2 (p.H1038R)/IGH::CEBPE; ZNF384 rearranged-like; KMT2A-rearranged-like; and CRLF2 rearrangement (non-Ph-like). Classification of T-ALL is complex with some variability in how the subtypes are defined in recent literature. It was classified as early T-precursor lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and T-ALL, NOS in the WHO revised 4th edition and WHO 5th edition. The ICC added an entity into early T-cell precursor ALL, BCL11B-activated, and also added provisional entities subclassified based on transcription factor families that are aberrantly activated.",0
"CD7 chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) therapy has potent antitumor activity against relapsed/refractory (R/R) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), however, immune reconstitution after CAR-T remains largely unknown. An open-label phase I clinical trial (ChiCTR2200058969) was initiated to evaluate safety and efficacy of donor-derived CD7 CAR-T cells in 7 R/R T-ALL/LBL patients. CAR-T cells were detected by flow cytometry and PCR. Cytokine levels were quantified by cytometric bead arrays. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was adopted to profile immune reconstitution. Optimal complete remission (CR) was 100% on day 28, and median followed-up time was 4 months. Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were observed in 6 patients, and infections occurred in 5 patients. Two patients died of serious infection and one died of a brain hemorrhage. CAR-T cells expanded efficiently in all patients. CD7+ T cells were eliminated in peripheral blood on day 11 after infusion, and CD7- T cells dramatically expanded in all patients. scRNA-seq suggested that immunologic activities of CD7- T cells were stronger than those of T cells before infusion due to higher expression levels of T-cell function-related pathways, and major characters of such CD7- T cells were activation of autoimmune-related pathways. Monocyte loss was found in 2 patients who died of serious infections, indicating the main cause of the infections after infusion. S100A8 and S100A9 were identified as potential relapse markers due to their notable upregulation in leukocyte lineage in relapsed patients versus non-relapse controls. Our data revealed cellular level dynamics of immune homeostasis of CD7 CAR-T therapy, which is valuable for optimizing the treatment of R/R T-ALL/LBL.",0
"A modified high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for determination of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) in peanuts and peanut products has been developed. Resveratrol was extracted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v) by blending with diatomaceous earth at high speed followed by purification of an aliquot of the extract on a minicolumn packed with Al(2)O(3)-ODS (C(18)) mixture. The column was eluted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v), eluate was evaporated under nitrogen, and residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase. Resveratrol in an aliquot of purified extract was quantitated by HPLC on silica gel with n-hexane-2-propanol-water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (1050/270/17/5/1, v/v) as a mobile phase. The recovery of resveratrol added to diatomaceous earth at 0.05 microg/g was 98.95 +/- 17.79%; the recovery of the standard added to fresh peanuts (with 0.070 microg/g natural level of resveratrol) at 0.50, 5.00, and 10.00 microg/g was 117.23 +/- 8.87, 100.10 +/- 2.49, and 100.45 +/- 1.51%, respectively. The quantitation limit of resveratrol in fresh peanuts was about 0. 01 microg/g. Roasted peanuts had the lowest content of resveratrol of 0.055 +/- 0.023 microg/g (n = 21), while in peanut butter its concentration was significantly higher, 0.324 +/- 0.129 microg/g (n = 46), and boiled peanuts had the highest level of 5.138 +/- 2.849 microg/g (n = 12). Resveratrol content in commercial peanut products was similar to the resveratrol content of the raw peanut fractions routinely used for making them.",1
"Epidemiological studies suggest that consumption of flavonol-rich diets decreases the risk of developing heart disease and certain cancers. Recent studies have detected flavonol conjugates in blood and urine following various dietary interventions. To assess to what extent flavonols also accumulate in tissues, where they might be expected to exert anti-carcinogenic and anti-atherogenic effects, [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was synthesized and fed to rats. After 60 min, 93.6% of the ingested radioactivity was recovered from the intestine, incorporated into 18 metabolites that had undergone deglycosylation followed by varying degrees of glucuronidation, methylation, and/or sulfation. [(14)C]Quercetin, the aglycon of the radiolabeled substrate, was present in the intestine and in trace amounts in the liver but was not detected in the plasma and kidneys. The original [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was detected exclusively in the intestine, where it accounted for only 26.2% of the radioactivity. The remainder of the recovered radioactivity was located mainly in the plasma, liver, and kidneys as (14)C-labeled metabolites. However, compared to the quantities in the gastrointestinal tract, the levels of metabolites in plasma and body tissues were very low, indicating only limited absorption into the blood stream. The data demonstrate that quercetin-4'-glucoside, which is a major flavonol in onions, undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism in the intestine, and this appears not to be associated to any extent with transport across the gut wall into the blood stream.",1
"This work regards the characterization of the phenolic compounds and the mineral composition of the variety Violetto di Toscana, which is typically cultivated in Tuscany for the flavour of its edible part. All the results achieved are compared with those of var. Terom, which is widely used in Italy. A systematic study was performed on the different plant parts: the edible head and leaves, outer bracts and stems. The data for the whole plant showed that the polyphenol content of var. Violetto exceeds that of var. Terom by about 25%, so this variety could be regarded as a functional food and also as an interesting source of antioxidant phenolic compounds. A decoction of bracts and leaves was also carried out in order to evaluate the amount of polyphenols which may be extracted by a simple hot water extraction.",1
"A simple isocratic HPLC technique has been developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids (PAs) in fruits and vegetables. Nine benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives were separated in less than 30 min, and the resolution was all more than 1.23. The ranges of linearity for PAs standards were 0.2-100 ng, even up to 600 ng (r = 0.983-1.000) and the detection limits were 0.02-0.24 mg/kg. Samples of fresh vegetables and fruits were extracted with 80% methanol and ethyl acetate, then purified with C18 Sep-Pak cartridge and determined by HPLC. This method was applied to the determination of PAs in 7 kinds of fruits and vegetables, i.e., apple, pear, Chinese cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, soybean sprout and white grape wine. The content of the 9 PAs varied widely in the 7 kinds of foods studied. The average concentrations of chlorogenic acid in apple (100.2 mg/kg) and pear (30.8 mg/kg) were quite high, and sinapinic acid was remarkable (42.5 mg/kg) in Chinese cabbage, and protocatechuic acid had the highest concentration of all the PAs in white wine.",1
"In this work, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem ion-trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) was used to investigate the in-vivo and in-vitro metabolism of tectoridin. After oral administration of a single dose (100 mg kg(-1)) of tectoridin to healthy rats, faeces and urine samples were collected for 0-48 h and 0-24 h, respectively. Tectoridin was also incubated with rat intestinal flora and rat liver microsomes. Samples from in-vivo and in-vitro metabolism studies were purified using a C(18) solid-phase extraction cartridge, then separated using a reverse-phase C(18) column with methanol/ water (30:70, v/v, adjusted to pH 10.0 with ammonia water) as mobile phase and detected by an on-line MS(n) system. The structure of the metabolites was elucidated by comparing their molecular weights, retention times and full-scan MS(n) spectra with those of the parent drug. The results revealed six metabolites of tectoridin in urine (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin, glucuronide-conjugated tectorigenin and sulfate-conjugated tectorigenin); three metabolites in faeces (tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin and sulfateconjugated tectorigenin); one metabolite in the intestinal flora incubation mixture (tectorigenin), and four in the liver microsomal incubation mixture (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin and di-hydroxylated tectorigenin). Except for tectorigenin, all other metabolites of tectoridin are reported for the first time.",1
"The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) was evaluated in 6136 children with ALL enrolled in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 study. Patients with B-cell precursor-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) were stratified as standard-risk/medium-risk (MR)/high-risk (HR) and those with T-ALL as non-High/HR. PEG-ASNase was administered intravenously at 2500 IU/sqm/dose. All patients received 2 PEG-ASNase doses in induction; thereafter non-HR versus HR patients received 1 versus 6 PEG-ASNase doses, respectively. After the single regular dose of PEG-ASNase at the beginning of delayed intensification, BCP-ALL-MR patients were randomized to receive 9 additional PEG-ASNase doses every 2 weeks (experimental arm [EA]) versus none (standard arm [SA]); HR patients were randomized to receive, in consolidation, 4 weekly PEG-ASNase doses (EA) versus none (SA). The HSR cumulative incidence (CI) was estimated adjusting for competing risks. An HSR occurred in 472 of 6136 (7.7%) patients. T-non- HR/BCP-Standard-Risk, BCP-MR-SA, BCP-MR-EA, HR-SA and HR-EA patients had 1-year-CI-HSR (±SE) rates of 5.2% (0.5), 5.2% (0.5), 4.0% (0.8), 20.2% (1.2), and 6.4% (1.3), respectively. The randomized intensification of PEG-ASNase did not significantly impact on HSR incidence in BCP-MR patients (1-y-CI-HSR 3.8% [0.8] versus 3.2% [0.6] in MR-EA versus MR-SA;",0
"Real-world data on outcomes of upfront allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) patients in first complete remission (CR1) is still lacking. A single center retrospective study was conducted from 94 consecutive patients received their first allo-HCT between 2010 and 2021, which include 76 patients received upfront allo-HCT and 18 patients received allo-HCT in non-upfront settings. There were no significant differences in most variables. In the upfront allo-HCT group, 52 (68%) patients achieved CR1 with one cycle of induction regimen. 24 (32%) patients achieved CR1 with more than one cycle. In the non-upfront group, there were 14 patients with active disease and 4 patients in second CR before transplant. The majority of patients received antithymocyte globulin-based graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. Median follow-up time was 51 months for both groups. 5-year overall survival (OS) was 54% in the upfront allo-HCT group. While, in the non-upfront group, 5-year OS were 19% (P = 0.013). 5-year progression free survival in the upfront group was higher than that in the non-upfront group (50% versus 20%, P = 0.02). 5-year cumulative incidence relapse rate was significantly higher in non-upfront group (64% vs. 32%, P = 0.006). While, there was no difference in the 5-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate (19% versus 16%, P = 0.56). The most common cause of death was disease progression. In multivariable analysis, non-upfront allo-HCT (hazard ratios (HR) 2.14, P = 0.03) and HCT-CI (≥ 2) (HR 6.07, P = 0.002) were identified to be associated with worse OS. Non-upfront allo-HCT and HCT-CI (≥ 2) were also found to be independent risk factors for higher relapse rate. While, haploidentical-HCT was found to be associated with increased NRM. Our study indicated that allo-HCT remains an important curative treatment for adult patients with T-ALL, especially when it was performed in the upfront setting.",0
"Individuals with hematological malignancies (HMs) are at a high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease due to underlying malignancy and subsequent immunosuppressive anticancer therapy. Early management of pneumococcal infections is crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable patient subgroup. In this study, we aim to review the current evidence and recommendations regarding the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) in patients with HMs and develop a consensus document on the optimal timing and patient profiles who can benefit from them. The modified Delphi consensus method was used for achieving consensus. The panel comprised a scientific committee of six experts from India. Questions were drafted for discussion around: (i) the risk and consequences of pneumococcal disease in HMs; (ii) barriers to pneumococcal vaccination in the hemato-oncology clinical setting; and (iii) evidence and optimal timing of pneumococcal vaccines in HMs. The questionnaire was shared with the panel through an online survey platform (Delphi round 1). The consensus level was classified as high (≥80%), moderate (60%-79%), and low (< 60%). A Delphi round 2 meeting was conducted to discuss the questions that received near or no consensus to reach an agreement. The final draft of consensus statements was circulated among the experts for approval. Pneumonia with or without bacteremia and bacteremia without foci of infection are the most frequently reported clinical presentations of pneumococcal infections in patients with HMs. A high risk of pneumococcal disease has been observed in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Priming with PCV enhances the response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 (PPSV23) in patients with HMs. Experts agreed that PCV is beneficial and can be strongly recommended in patients with CLL, MM, and patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) would benefit from systematic revaccination with PCV after chemotherapy. The evidence is inadequate to consistently recommend pneumococcal vaccination to all patients with lymphoma, AML, and adults with ALL. This expert consensus will guide clinicians on the recommended approach for administering pneumococcal vaccination to patients with HMs.",0

"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is frequently employed for cardiac surgery, and selecting a suitable priming fluid is a prerequisite for CPB. Currently, the commonly used priming fluids in clinics are classified as crystalloids and colloids, including balanced crystalloids, albumin, dextran, gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch (HES). This network meta-analysis compared the effects of eight fluids used during CPB in adults to determine optimal priming fluid during CPB surgery. Randomised controlled trials assessing priming fluids for CPB in adult cardiac surgery published before 13 April 2023 were searched across Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, OVID EMbase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Various priming fluids were classified into eight categories, including balanced crystalloids, 0.9% NaCl, iso-oncotic human albumin, hyperoncotic human albumin, HES with molecular weight 130k, HES with molecular weight 200k, gelatin and dextran. The NMA of platelet counts revealed no significant differences in any result. In direct comparison results, only the comparison of HES with molecular weight 130k vs. gelatin (standard mean difference = -0.40, 95% confidence interval [95%CI: -0.63, -0.16) revealed a significant difference. According to the SUCRA, balanced crystalloids had the highest platelet count, followed by gelatin, and HES with a molecular weight of 130k had the lowest platelet, followed by HES with a molecular weight of 200k. Patients using dextran have a low mortality rate and a short mean CPB time, the use of balanced crystalloids is beneficial in terms of platelet count, and HES with molecular weight 130k is beneficial for postoperative urine volume at 24h. However, all priming fluids have pros and cons quite, and the optimal choice of priming fluids remains unsupported by current evidences. When performing CPB surgery, the type of priming fluid should be selected according to the actual situation in CPB for adult cardiac surgery. When dextran was used as the CPB priming fluid, patients had the lowest mortality and shortest mean CPB time.With iso-oncotic HA, patients had the shortest length of ICU stay, the least blood loss 24h after surgery, and the lowest chest tube output 24h after surgery.The use of balanced crystalloids was beneficial for platelet count, the use of L-HES was beneficial for urine output 24h after surgery, and the use of H-HES resulted in the shortest hospital stay.In summary, each of these fluids has pros and cons quite, and an optimal choice of priming fluids during CPB surgery remains unsupported by current evidence.When performing CPB surgery, the type of priming fluids should be selected according to the actual condition of the patient’s body.",0
"This study suggests a novel Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) diagnostic model, built solely on complete blood count (CBC) records. Using a dataset comprised of CBC records of 86 ALL and 86 control patients respectively, we identified the most ALL-specific parameters using a feature selection approach. Next, Grid Search-based hyperparameter tuning with a five-fold cross-validation scheme was adopted to build classifiers using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree algorithms. A comparison between the performances of the three models demonstrates that Decision Tree classifier outperformed XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms in ALL detection using CBC-based records.",0
"Pain is a prevalent, frequent, and often persistent symptom among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Despite its high prevalence, pain has remained understudied, and no evidence-based recommendations exist for how best to assess and treat pain in this population. Without proper assessment, clinical efforts to improve pain management in pediatric ALL will be ineffective. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to describe and identify gaps in measurement approaches that have been used to assess pain in pediatric ALL, evaluate the psychometric properties of available pediatric pain measures, and provide recommendations for clinical research and practice. Literature searches were performed following Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Domains of pain assessed, measures used to assess pain, measure format, respondent, and timing of pain assessment were extracted from studies that met inclusion criteria. The psychometric properties of included measures were then evaluated. A total of 238 full-text articles were screened and 123 met inclusion criteria. Most studies assessed pain using generic health-related quality of life instruments rather than pain-specific measures. A total of 39 measures were used across the 123 included studies, and the psychometric properties of the measures varied considerably. Recommendations include a selection of well-validated pain assessment measures that are currently available and can be used to facilitate best practices in ALL pain assessment. Clinicians and investigators are encouraged to utilize a multidimensional pain assessment approach to inform and enhance pain care in pediatric ALL.",0
" A near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy technique for the prediction of procyanidins in cocoa beans (Theobroma cacao) has been developed. A select group of cocoa liquors from different origins used for the manufacture of chocolate were analyzed to determine quantitative levels of procyanidin oligomers (monomer to decamer) using normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The calibration set included seasonal, environmental, and fermentation variations to cover the concentration range of procyanidins found at naturally occurring levels. The sample set was analyzed on FOSS NIR System II 6500 spectrophotometers and partial least-squares algorithms developed. Very good calibration statistics were obtained for the prediction of the total procyanidin oligomers (r2 = 0.983) with standard deviation/standard error of cross validation ratio (SD/SECV) of 5.68. A global version of this calibration, involving 20 Foss instruments produced a calibration r2 = 0.98 with a SD/ SECV = 6.20. Procyanidins have attracted increasing attention because of the rapidly growing body of evidence associating these compounds with a wide range of potential health benefits. A rapid method for the analysis of procyanidins in cocoa liquors would be beneficial in quality-control environments and would provide cost benefits to manufacturing operations.",1
"In the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches, the step of target identification is a challenging process, because it aims at identifying robust tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) specific for the pathological population and causing no off-target effects. Here we propose CD72 as a novel and robust TAA for pediatric acute leukemias. We provided an outline of CD72 expression assessed by flow cytometry on a variety of cancer cell lines and primary samples, including normal bone marrow (BM) samples and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. We analyzed CD 72 expression on a cohort of 495 pathological pediatric BM aspirates, including: 215 B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (BCP-ALL), 156 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), 88 T-lineage ALLs or lymphoblastic lymphomas with BM infiltration, 13 B-lineage lymphoblastic lymphomas with BM infiltration, 9 myelodysplastic syndromes with increased blasts (5%-9% blasts on BM: MDS-IB1) and 14 non-hematopoietic solid tumors infiltrating BM. Results showed that CD72 is highly expressed in almost all BCP-ALL and the majority of AML at diagnosis, including BCP-ALL cases characterized by CD19 loss. These findings support a potential role for advanced diagnostics and novel immunotherapy approaches, providing a pan-ALL and AML target.",0
