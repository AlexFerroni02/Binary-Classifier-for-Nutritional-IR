"Influence of glucose on cyanidin 3-glucoside absorption in rats Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various health effects. However their mechanisms of absorption are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of glucose on anthocyanin absorption in rats. We first studied anthocyanin bioavailability in rats that received by gastric intubation approximately 53 micromol cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) equivalents from a red orange extract with or without 2.51 mmol glucose. Neither 24-h urinary anthocyanin excretion nor plasma anthocyanin concentration was significantly affected by simultaneous ingestion of glucose. The influence of glucose (12, 42 or 72 mM) on intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc (pure or from a red orange extract; approximately 12.3 microM) was further studied using an in situ intestinal perfusion model. Absorption of pure Cy 3-glc from the intestinal lumen was not significantly affected by the amount of glucose. However, intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc from the red orange extract (6.49 +/- 1.44%, n = 6) was significantly less than that of pure Cy 3-glc (17.5 +/- 1.3%, n = 7) (p < 0.01) suggesting that the red orange extract contained other components that were able to interfere with Cy 3-glc intestinal absorption. This study has thus shown that glucose did not interfere with anthocyanin glucoside absorption.",1

"Determination of anthocyanins and related components in red wines by micro- and capillary HPLC Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and quantification of components present in a very small amounts.",1
"Pharmacokinetics of soybean isoflavones in plasma, urine and feces of men after ingestion of 60 g baked soybean powder (kinako) To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have biological effects.",0

"Phlorin screening in various citrus species and varieties Phlorin (3,5-dihydroxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside), an orange peel marker, has been searched in 45 species and varieties of Citrus. The phlorin content was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography in juices and aqueous peel extracts of these different fruits. The phlorin content in C. reticulata peel extract varies from 0 to 1012 mg L(-)(1) with a mean of 162 mg L(-)(1). On the contrary, phlorin was not found in mandarin and clementine juices except for mandarin ""Commune"" and ""Beauty"" (33 and 30 mg L(-)(1), respectively). In the 14 species of oranges and varieties, phlorin was detected in juices and peel extracts with a mean of 22 and 492 mg L(-)(1), respectively, while for grapefruits, means were 108 mg L(-)(1) in juices and 982 mg L(-)(1) for peel extracts. Tangors and tangelos which are hybrids (C. reticulata x C. sinensis and C. reticulata x C. paradisi, respectively) are characterized by the systematic presence of phlorin in peels (mean: 406 and 659 mg L(-)(1), respectively) while in juices its presence could be variable (0-73 mg L(-)(1)). These heterogeneity and values may be explained by the genetic variability of these hybrids and the phlorin content of their parentage group.",1
"Simultaneous separation of flavanone glycosides and polymethoxylated flavones in citrus juices using liquid chromatography We present a simultaneous liquid chromatographic method for the separation of two flavonoid compound families, flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), which are usually found in citrus fruits species and varieties. This technique permits the quantitation of six FGs (narirutin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, poncirin) and six PMFs (sinensetin, hexamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, scutellarein, heptamethoxyflavone and tangeretin). This technique, to be used to characterize a citrus juice by its polyphenolic profile, has been applied to the determination of flavonoid compounds in grapefruit- and orange juice. Differentiation of orange juice varieties and mixtures containing tangor juice using polyphenolic profiles and flavonoid content has been achieved.",1
"Bioavailability of trans-resveratrol from red wine in humans Many in vitro studies demonstrated significant biological effects of trans-resveratrol. Thus, understanding the rate of intestinal absorption and metabolization in vivo of trans-resveratrol is the prerequisite to evaluate its potential health impact. Bioavailability studies mainly in animals or in humans using the pure compound at very high doses were performed. In this work, trans-resveratrol bioavailability from a moderate consumption of red wine in 25 healthy humans has been studied by three different experiments. The wine ingestion was associated to three different dietary approaches: fasting, a standard meal, a meal with high and low amount of lipids. Trans-resveratrol 3- and 4'-glucuronides were synthesized, purified, and characterized as pure standards. Bioavailability data were obtained by measuring the concentration of free, 3-glucuronide and 4'-glucuronide trans-resveratrol by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), both with ultraviolet (UV) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection, in serum samples taken at different times after red wine administration. Free trans-resveratrol was found, in trace amounts, only in some serum samples collected 30 min after red wine ingestion while after longer times resveratrol glucuronides predominated. Trans-resveratrol bioavailability was shown to be independent from the meal or its lipid content. The finding in human serum of trans-resveratrol glucuronides, rather than the free form of the compound, with a high interindividual variability, raises some doubts about the health effects of dietary resveratrol consumption and suggests that the benefits associated to red wine consumption could be probably due to the whole antioxidant pool present in red wine.",1
"Effect of processing and storage on the antioxidant ellagic acid derivatives and flavonoids of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) jams From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.",1
"Nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) undergoing different cooking methods and germination The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and restaurants.",0
"Changes in phenolic content of tomato products during storage The effect of storage on the total polyphenol content and individual phenolic compounds as well as on the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity of ketchups and tomato juices was studied. The total polyphenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction was determined using DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. Individual polyphenols were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole. All analyses were carried out for ketchups and tomato juices after storage for 3, 6, and 9 months. The total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction decreased during storage of ketchups and tomato juices. Ketchups, in general, showed a slightly greater stability during storage than tomato juices. The most significant decrease was observed for quercetin followed by caffeic and ferulic acids, whereas glycosilated polyphenols showed greater stability during storage.",1
"Phytoestrogen content of beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils Phytoestrogens are secondary plant metabolites that have received increasing attention for their bioactivity, in particular due to their structural and functional similarity to 17beta-estradiol. Although urinary and plasma phytoestrogens can be used as biomarkers for dietary intake, this is often not possible in large epidemiological studies or in the assessment of general exposure in free-living individuals. Accurate information about dietary phytoestrogens is therefore important, but there are very limited data concerning food contents. In this study was analyzed a comprehensive selection of tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils for their phytoestrogen content using a newly developed sensitive method based on LC-MS incorporating (13)C 3-labeled standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analyzed, although the contents in gin and bitter (beer) were below the limit of quantification (1.5 microg/100 g). Lignans were the main type of phytoestrogens detected. Tea and coffee contained up to 20 microg/100 g phytoestrogens and beer (except bitter) contained up to 71 microg/100 g, mainly lignans. As these beverages are commonly consumed, they are a main source of dietary lignans. The results published here will contribute to databases of dietary phytoestrogen content and allow a more accurate determination of phytoestrogen exposure in free-living individuals.",1

"Identification and quantification of the conjugated metabolites derived from orally administered hesperidin in rat plasma Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using these authentic compounds, the concentrations of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from orally administered hesperidin.",1
"Flaxseed influences urinary lignan excretion in a dose-dependent manner in postmenopausal women Dietary estrogens, such as lignans, are similar in structure to endogenous sex steroid hormones and may act in vivo to alter hormone metabolism and subsequent cancer risk. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary intake of a lignan-rich plant food (flaxseed) on urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal women. This randomized, cross-over trial consisted of three 7-week feeding periods during which 31 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 52-82 years, consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5, or 10 grams of ground flaxseed per day. Urine samples collected for 2 consecutive days during the last week of each feeding period were analyzed for lignan content (enterodiol, enterolactone, and matairesinol) by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared with the 0-gram flaxseed diet, consumption of 5 or 10 grams of flaxseed significantly increased excretion of enterodiol by 1,009 and 2,867 nmol/day, respectively; significantly increased excretion of enterolactone by 21,242 and 52,826 nmol/day, respectively; and significantly increased excretion of total lignans (enterodiol + enterolactone + matairesinol) by 24,333 and 60,640 nmol/day, respectively. Excretion of matairesinol was not significantly altered by flaxseed consumption. Consumption of flax, a significant source of dietary estrogens, in addition to their habitual diets increased excretion of enterodiol and enterolactone, but not matairesinol, in a dose-dependent manner in this group of postmenopausal women. Urinary excretion of lignan metabolites is a dose-dependent biomarker of flaxseed intake within the context of a habitual diet.",1

"Total and individual carotenoids and phenolic acids content in fresh, refrigerated and processed spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) The carotenoid and phenolic acid contents in fresh, stored and processed (blanched, frozen and boiled) spinach were comparatively determined by spectrophotometric and HPLC analyses. The major carotenoids identified after HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene (18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid (1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type. After storage of spinach at different temperatures (4°C or -18°C) the amount of total phenolic compounds decreased by around 20%, while the amount of individual phenolic acids increased by four times on average.",1
"Optimisation of gradient HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds and favonoids in beer using a CoulArray detector A method was developed for simultaneous analysis of natural antioxidants in beer using multichannel electrochemical detection with a CoulArray detector, which enables selective and sensitive antioxidant detection in gradient HPLC and facilitates the identification of analytes based on the ratios of signals recorded at different potentials applied to the detection cells arranged in series. The separation conditions were optimised for 27 phenolic compounds including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides identified in beer samples. Separation selectivities of 11 columns with different stationary phase chemistries were compared, and the pH and gradient programs were optimised for the individual columns to provide best resolution and high number of resolved peaks, using the window-diagram approach. The effects of pH on the sensitivity of electrochemical coulometric detection were considered in the optimisation approach. The optimised conditions were applied to the analysis of real beer samples.",0
"Polyphenolic profiles and antioxidant activities of heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. cordiformis) and Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant power and photochemiluminescence methods.",1
"Phenolic acids, syringaldehyde, and juglone in fruits of different cultivars of juglans regia L Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid (cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).",1
"Relationship among antioxidant activity, vasodilation capacity, and phenolic content of red wines The relationship among antioxidant activity, based on the electron-spin resonance determination of the reduction of Fremy's radical, vasodilation activity, and phenolic content was investigated in 16 red wines. The wines were selected to provide a range of origins, grape varieties, and vinification methods. Sensitive and selective HPLC methods were used for the analysis of the major phenolics in red wine: free and conjugated myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin; (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, caftaric acid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol, and trans-resveratrol glucoside. Total anthocyanins were measured using a colorimetric assay. The total phenolic content of the wines was determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay and also by the cumulative measurements obtained by HPLC. The 16 wines exhibited a wide range in the values of all parameters investigated. However, the total phenol contents, measured both by HPLC and colorimetrically, correlated very strongly with the antioxidant activity and vasodilation activity. In addition, the antioxidant activity was associated with gallic acid, total resveratrol, and total catechin. In contrast, only the total anthocyanins were correlated with vasodilation activity. The results demonstrate that the different phenolic profiles of wines can produce varying antioxidant and vasodilatant activities, which opens up the possibility that some red wines may provide enhanced health benefits for the consumer.",1
"Rat gastrointestinal tissues metabolize quercetin Quercetin and quercetin glycosides from food or dietary supplements appear in body tissues almost exclusively as glucuronated, sulfated, and methylated quercetin conjugates, suggesting that the in vivo bioactivity of quercetin may be due to its metabolites. In this study, pre- and postabsorptive metabolism of orally ingested quercetin was examined by comparing the metabolite pattern in gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, contents, and internal tissues. F344 rats (n = 6) were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 0.45% quercetin and the metabolite patterns were determined in the tissues and contents of stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon and in liver, kidney, and plasma using LC-MS/MS. GI contents contained predominantly unmetabolized quercetin at 94-100%, whereas quercetin in GI tissues was present as 11 different sulfated, glucuronated, and methylated metabolites at 32% in stomach, 88% in small intestine, 27% in cecum, and 46% in colon. Quercetin was further metabolized postabsorption and found in liver, kidney, and plasma almost exclusively as sulfated methyl-quercetin glucuronide. The unique pattern of quercetin metabolites in each GI tissue indicates extensive biotransformation before absorption and distribution in rats.",0
Identification and analysis of absorbed and metabolic components in rat plasma after oral administration of 'Shuangdan' granule by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The results proved that the established method could be used to identify the structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 'Shuangdan' granule.,0

"Anthocyanin composition in black, blue, pink, purple, and red cereal grains Anthocyanin pigments from a wide variety of edible and ornamental black, blue, pink, purple, red, and white wheat, barley, corn, rice, and wild rice were identified and quantified to evaluate their potential as natural colorants or functional food ingredients. The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly and exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and black rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as blue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 anthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. The remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of spectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most abundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in blue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and delphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.",1

"Polyphenol profiles of French cider apple varieties (Malus domestica sp.) The cortex of 14 French apple varieties (12 cider and 2 juice varieties), one English cider variety, and one dessert apple (i.e., Golden Delicious) were studied for their polyphenol composition. Total polyphenols were assayed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the precise polyphenolic composition (monomeric catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) was obtained by HPLC following thiolysis. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid were methylated under the conditions of thiolysis. Depending on the variety, the global polyphenol concentration varied from 1 to 7 g per kilogram of fresh cortex. Cider varieties globally showed a higher polyphenol concentration than the dessert apple Golden Delicious, bitter varieties being the more concentrated. The proportion of the polyphenol classes varied greatly from one cultivar to another. For all varieties, procyanidins were always the predominant class. They were mainly constituted of (-)-epicatechin units with a small proportion of (+)-catechin as a terminal unit. The average degree of polymerization ranged between 4.2 and 7.5 depending upon the variety with an exception for the sharp varieties Guillevic and Avrolles which showed significant concentrations of procyanidins with DPn of 40 and 50, respectively.",1

"A new process to develop a cocoa powder with higher flavonoid monomer content and enhanced bioavailability in healthy humans Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are warranted.",0
"Antioxidant properties of roasted coffee residues The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.",0
"Quantitation of polymethoxylated flavones in orange juice by high-performance liquid chromatography A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature. The HPLC procedure is considerably faster than the TLC procedure with equal or superior precision and accuracy.",1
"Dietary flaxseed supplementation ameliorates inflammation and oxidative tissue damage in experimental models of acute lung injury in mice Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P = 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.",0

"Determination of some pharmacologically active phenolic acids in juices by high-performance liquid chromatography Several phenolic acids, e.g. caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and ellagic acid, which occur naturally, are inhibitors of carcinogenesis. In this paper we present a new method for the simultaneous determination of all of these compounds, except ellagic acid, in juices by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ultraviolet detection and involving isocratic elution, and we have devised an HPLC method for the determination of ellagic acid in juices. The experimental results showed that cherry juice contains a high concentration of chlorogenic acid and the content of bound gallic acid in black and green grape juices is high compared to that of other phenolic acids.",1
"Screening flavonoid metabolites of naringin and narirutin in urine after human consumption of grapefruit juice by LC-MS and LC-MS/MS The main flavonoids in grapefruit juice, naringin and narirutin, were quantified by LC-MS with structural differentiation by LC-MS/MS. After human consumption of grapefruit juice, urine samples were collected for 24 hours and screened for flavonoid metabolites by LC-MS. The metabolite structures (glucuronides, sulfates, and glucuronide sulfates) were then confirmed via their unique fragmentation patterns by LC-MS/MS. To further verify the identity of the common aglycon (naringenin) shared by the metabolites, enzymatic hydrolysis was performed and the resulting products were analyzed. This work demonstrates that LC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques can be used for fast metabolite screening without extensive sample preparation.",1

"Concentrations of Proanthocyanidins in Common Foods and Estimations of Normal Consumption Proanthocyanidins (PAs) have been shown to have potential health benefits. However, no data exist concerning their dietary intake. Therefore, PAs in common and infant foods from the U.S. were analyzed. On the bases of our data and those from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) of 1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to 6-mo-old and 6- to 10-mo-old infants was estimated to be 1.3 mg and 26.9 mg, respectively, based on the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics. This study supports the concept that PAs account for a major fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in Western diets.",1
"Influence of cultivar on quality parameters and chemical composition of strawberry fruits grown in Brazil Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 (cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289 (mean 221) mg/100 g.",1
"Antioxidant capacity of 26 spice extracts and characterization of their phenolic constituents Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values (0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation. This study provides direct comparative data on antioxidant capacity and total and individual phenolics contents of the 26 spice extracts.",1
"Plasma profiling of intact isoflavone metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometric identification of flavone glycosides daidzin and genistin in human plasma after admin The roles of isoflavones in the prevention of several hormone-dependent cancers and osteoporosis are of great interest. Despite many pharmacokinetics studies of the isoflavones, the actual types of conjugates circulating in the body and the position(s) of conjugation sites on the flavone skeleton are still uncertain because, in general, conjugated compounds in biological fluids have been evaluated by measuring the free aglycones obtained after selective enzymatic hydrolysis. Using an high-performance (HPLC)-UV-diode-array detector (DAD) method combined with solid-phase extraction, we have obtained HPLC profiles of isoflavone glycosides [daidzin (Din) and genistin (Gin)] and of intact isoflavone metabolites in human plasma: daidzein, genistein, daizein-7-glucuronide, daidzein-4'-glucuronide, genistein-7-glucuronide, genistein-4'-glucuronide, daidzein-7-sulfate, daidzein-4'-sulfate, genistein-7-sulfate, and genistein-4'-sulfate. We investigated the plasma profile of intact isoflavone metabolites in plasma obtained 1 to-7 h after orally administration of 50 g of kinako (baked soybean powder) to two healthy volunteers. The results of DAD analysis indicated that the main isoflavone metabolite peaks were identified on the HPLC chromatogram. Furthermore, the intact glycosides Din and Gin were detected in 1-h plasma samples by their positive electrospray ionization mass spectra, demonstrating that the glycosides Din and Gin can be absorbed from the gut.",1
"Effect of Thermal and High-Pressure Processing on the Nutritional Value and Quality Attributes of a Nectarine Puree with Industrial Origin during the Refrigerated Storage The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine (Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity optimization.",0

"Composition and stability of anthocyanins in blue-grained wheat Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential end uses.",0
"Phenolic compounds in white grapes grown in New York Phenolic compounds in 21 grape cultivars grown in New York during the 1985 season were analyzed by using column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. Trans -caffeoyl tartaric acid, cis -coumaroyl tartaric acid, and trans -coumaroyl tartaric acid were the major components of acidic phenolics, while catechin, epicatechin, and two unidentified compounds were the major constituents in the neutral phenolics. One of the unidentified compounds was tentatively identified as a catechin-gallate and the others as isomers of catechin-catechin-gallate. There were large differences in the phenolic make-up of the individual cultivars. Mean values of individual phenolics were higher in the New York grapes than in those from the western United States and Europe.",0
"Varietal differences among the polyphenol profiles of seven table grape cultivars studied by LC-DAD-MS-MS Polyphenols present in red table grape varieties Red Globe, Flame Seedless, Crimson Seedless, and Napoleon, and the white varieties Superior Seedless, Dominga, and Moscatel Italica were analyzed by HPLC-DAD-MS. The anthocyanins peonidin 3-glucoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside (and their corresponding p-coumaroyl derivatives), malvidin 3-glucoside, petunidin 3-glucoside, and delphinidin 3-glucoside were found. In addition, caffeoyltartaric acid, p-coumaroyltartaric acid, and the flavonols quercetin 3-glucuronide, quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-galactoside, kaempferol 3-glucoside, and isorhamnetin 3-glucoside were detected. Flavan-3-ols were also detected, and were identified as gallocatechin, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, procyanidin B4, procyanidin C1, catechin, and epigallocatechin. These phenolics were present only in the skin, as the flesh of these grape cultivars was almost devoid of these compounds. Anthocyanins were the main phenolics in red grapes ranging from 69 (Crimson Seedless) to 151 (Flame Seedless) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes, whereas flavan-3-ols were the most abundant phenolics in the white varieties ranging from 52 (Dominga) to 81 (Moscatel Italica) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes. Total phenolics ranged from 115 (Dominga) to 361 (Flame Seedless) mg/kg fresh weight of grapes. This means that a serving of unpeeled table grapes (200 g) could provide up to 72 mg of total phenolics (Flame Seedless). These results indicate that the intake of unpeeled table grapes should be recommended in dietary habits as a potential source of antioxidant and anticarcinogenic phenolic compounds.",1
"Characterization and quantification of phenolic compounds in olive oils by solid-phase extraction, HPLC-DAD, and HPLC-MS/MS A simple and reproducible method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils by solid-phase extraction (SPE), high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) in tandem mode was developed. The polar fraction was obtained from samples of three different virgin olive oils. Detection and quantification were performed at 280, 240, and 320 nm. For identification purposes, HPLC-MS/MS was equipped with turbo ion spray source in the negative-ion mode. Twenty compounds of twenty-three detected and quantified were characterized. The method showed satisfactory linearity (r > 0.99), good recovery, satisfactory precision, and appropriate limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ).",1
"Phytochemical phenolics in organically grown vegetables Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic agents in pac choi.",0
"Identification of nobiletin metabolites in mouse urine Nobiletin, a major component of citrus polymethoxyflavones, has many potential significant health benefits. While the biological activities of nobiletin have been widely reported, its in vitro and in vivo metabolic fate has been rarely studied. To explore the biotransformation mechanism of nobiletin we conducted an investigation into its metabolic profile in mouse urine, by various analytical techniques. Due to sample amount limitations for isolating and characterizing an individual metabolite, two possible nobiletin metabolites were prepared in a similar multi-step organic synthetic route: 3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (3'-demethylnobiletin) and 4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxyflavone (4'-demethylnobiletin). Normal phase (silica gel) and C(18) reverse phase chromatography, as well as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry, were employed in the separation of 3'-demethylnobiletin and 4'-demethylnobiletin, however, without success due to the structural similarities of these mono-demethylated nobiletins. Using a chiral packed column eluted under supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) conditions, a clear separation was achieved. Thus, by comparing the SFC profiles of metabolite mixtures with the synthesized standard compounds, the major nobiletin metabolite of mouse urine is identified as 4'-demethylnobiletin, whereas 3'-demethylnobiletin is a minor metabolite. In this study, the concentration of 4'-demethylnobiletin in mouse urine is 28.9 microg/mL.",0
"Blackberry anthocyanins are mainly recovered from urine as methylated and glucuronidated conjugates in humans The consumption of anthocyanins has been shown to prevent certain chronic diseases. However, anthocyanin metabolism has not yet been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate anthocyanin urinary excretion in humans receiving a meal containing blackberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Five healthy volunteers were fed 200 g of blackberries (960 mumol of anthocyanins). Urine samples were collected and rapidly treated by solid-phase extraction. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-vis detection, respectively. In addition to native cyanidin 3-glucoside, several other anthocyanin metabolites were identified in the urine: methylated glycosides, glucuronides of anthocyanidins and anthocyanins, a sulfoconjugate of cyanidin, and anthocyanidins. Total urinary excretion of blackberry anthocyanin metabolites was 0.160 +/- 0.020% (n = 5) of the amount of anthocyanins ingested. Monoglucuronides of anthocyanidins represented >60% of this excretion. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins was maximal between 2 and 4 h after the meal, but continued during the 24 h of the experiment. This study highlighted the influence of aglycon structure on anthocyanin urinary excretion. It demonstrated that anthocyanins are not only methylated but also glucuroconjugated and sulfoconjugated in humans and that the main metabolites of blackberry anthocyanins in human urine were anthocyanidin monoglucuronides.",1
"Flaxseed influences urinary lignan excretion in a dose-dependent manner in postmenopausal women Dietary estrogens, such as lignans, are similar in structure to endogenous sex steroid hormones and may act in vivo to alter hormone metabolism and subsequent cancer risk. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary intake of a lignan-rich plant food (flaxseed) on urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal women. This randomized, cross-over trial consisted of three 7-week feeding periods during which 31 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 52-82 years, consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5, or 10 grams of ground flaxseed per day. Urine samples collected for 2 consecutive days during the last week of each feeding period were analyzed for lignan content (enterodiol, enterolactone, and matairesinol) by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared with the 0-gram flaxseed diet, consumption of 5 or 10 grams of flaxseed significantly increased excretion of enterodiol by 1,009 and 2,867 nmol/day, respectively; significantly increased excretion of enterolactone by 21,242 and 52,826 nmol/day, respectively; and significantly increased excretion of total lignans (enterodiol + enterolactone + matairesinol) by 24,333 and 60,640 nmol/day, respectively. Excretion of matairesinol was not significantly altered by flaxseed consumption. Consumption of flax, a significant source of dietary estrogens, in addition to their habitual diets increased excretion of enterodiol and enterolactone, but not matairesinol, in a dose-dependent manner in this group of postmenopausal women. Urinary excretion of lignan metabolites is a dose-dependent biomarker of flaxseed intake within the context of a habitual diet.",0
"Measurement of intact sulfate and glucuronide phytoestrogen conjugates in human urine using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with [13C(3)]isoflavone internal standards A method has been developed for the analysis of phytoestrogens and their conjugates in human urine using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Stable isotopically labeled [13C(3)]daidzein and [13C(3)]genistein were synthesized and used as internal standards for isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Free aglycons and intact glucuronide, sulfate, diglucuronide, disulfate, and mixed sulfoglucuronide conjugates of isoflavones and lignans were observed in naturally incurred urine samples. Sample pretreatment was not necessary, other than addition of internal standards and pH adjustment. Urine was injected directly onto the analytical column. The limits of detection were generally <50ng/ml, precision was generally <10% CV for conjugates. Total hydrolyzed daidzein and genistein were measured against quality assurance urine sample and were accurate to within 12%. The accuracy of conjugate measurement can not be ascertained, as no reference samples are available. The mean sum of daidzein and its conjugates was within 20% of the hydrolyzed value. Concentrations of the free aglycons of up to 22% of genistein and 18% of daidzein were observed. The average pattern was ca. 54% 7-glucuronide, 25% 4(')-glucuronide, 13% monosulfates, 7% free daidzein, 0.9% sulfoglucuronides, 0.4% diglucuronide, and <0.1% disulfate. Selective enzymatic deconjugation with glucuronidase and mixed glucuronidase/sulfatase were used to validate the accuracy of the quantitation of the intact daidzein conjugates. There were no apparent sex differences, or conditioning effects on the conjugation profile of isoflavones after chronic dosing.",1
"Phenolic profiles of raw apricots, pumpkins, and their purees in the evaluation of apricot nectar and jam authenticity The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.",1
"In vitro antioxidant activities of barley, husked oat, naked oat, triticale, and buckwheat wastes and their influence on the growth and biomarkers of antioxidant status in rats The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS (4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).",1
"Metabolism of antioxidant and chemopreventive ellagitannins from strawberries, raspberries, walnuts, and oak-aged wine in humans: Identification of biomarkers and individual variability Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.",1

"Determination of total content of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity in vegetables - evaluation of spectrophotometric methods This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods (catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.",1

"Effect of freezing and storage on the phenolics, ellagitannins, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of red raspberries Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per serving.",0
"The differential tissue distribution of the citrus flavanone naringenin following gastric instillation Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.",1
"Effect of processing on the phytochemical profiles and antioxidant activity of corn for production of masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.",1
"Flavonoids in vegetable foods commonly consumed in Brazil and estimated ingestion by the Brazilian population The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory (18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.",1

"Phenolic composition of strawberry genotypes at different maturation stages The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green and ripe fruit were detected.",0
"Chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-rutinoside and black tea phenols are extensively metabolized in humans Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid (major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.",0
"Effect of storage on secoiridoid and tocopherol contents and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.",1
"Changes in volatile and phenolic compounds with malaxation time and temperature during virgin olive oil production Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids (FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde (3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil extraction.",0
"An LC-MS method to determine concentrations of isoflavones and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates in urine Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in biological fluids.",1
"Flavonoids in Pigmented Orange Juice and Second-Pressure Extracts Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from SPEs was proposed.",0
"Influence of domestic processing and storage on flavonol contents in berries Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry (9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during storage.",0
"Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 % w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order to prevent chronic diseases.",0
"Activity and concentration of polyphenolic antioxidants in apple juice. 1. Effect of existing production methods Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.",1

"Strawberry consumption is associated with increased antioxidant capacity in serum Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < .01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant capacity in a healthy population.",0

"Isolation and identification of ten metabolites of breviscapine in rat urine Breviscapine, is the total flavonoid components (the content of scutellarin > or =85%) extracted from the dried whole plant of Erigeron breviscapus (VANT.) HAND.-MAZZ, and its preparations are generally used in the clinic for the treatment of cerebral and cardio-vascular diseases in China. In this paper, the metabolites of breviscapine in the urine of rats after oral administration were investigated. The ten metabolites were isolated by open-column chromatography and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by MS, NMR spectroscopy including (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and NOESY (nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), enzymatic hydrolysis and chemical evidence. The ten metabolites were identified as scutellarein-6,7-di-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-1), scutellarein (M-2), 6-O-methyl-scutellarin (M-3), 6-O-methyl-scutellarein (M-4), scutellarein-6-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-5), scutellarein-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-6), scutellarin (M-7), scutellarein-7-O-sulfate (M-8), apigenin-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-9), and apigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-10) respectively. The results of this study indicated that the metabolites of brevisvapine were excreted in rats urine as glucuronidated, sulfated or methylated forms, as well as the aglycone of scutellarin-scutellarein after oral administration, and the metabolic pathways were also proposed.",1
"Lignan contents of Dutch plant foods: a database including lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan precursors, but now several new precursors have been identified, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database including all four major enterolignan precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-three solid foods and twenty-six beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans was flaxseed (301,129 microg/100 g), which contained mainly secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29,331 microg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg/100 g. However, many vegetables and fruits had similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of lignans (185-2321 microg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91 microg/100 ml (red wine). Only four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol. Thus, available databases largely underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods.",1
"Changes in phytochemical and antioxidant activity of selected pepper cultivars (Capsicum species) as influenced by maturity The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.",1
"Comparative assessment of distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins in rabbit and rat ocular tissues Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous and lens. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BCAs were absorbed and distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier in both rats and rabbits.",1
"Proanthocyanidin glycosides and related polyphenols from cacao liquor and their antioxidant effects Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.",1

Identification and analysis of absorbed and metabolic components in rat plasma after oral administration of 'Shuangdan' granule by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The results proved that the established method could be used to identify the structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 'Shuangdan' granule.,1

"Novel biomarkers of the metabolism of caffeic acid derivatives in vivo The purpose of this study was to investigate biomarkers of the bioavailability and metabolism of hydroxycinnamate derivatives through the determination of the pharmacokinetics of their urinary elimination and identification of the metabolites excreted. Coffee was used as a rich source of caffeic acid derivatives and human supplementation was undertaken. The results show a highly significant increase in the excretion of ferulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic acid (3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid), and vanillic acid postsupplementation relative to the levels presupplementation. Thus, ferulic, isoferulic, and dihydroferulic acids are specific biomarkers for the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary caffeic acid esters. Isoferulic acid is a unique biomarker as it is not a dietary component, however, dihydroferulic acid may well derive from other flavonoids with a structurally related B-ring. 3-Hydroxyhippuric acid has also been identified as an indicator for bioavailability and metabolism of phenolic compounds, and shows a highly significant excretion increase postsupplementation. The results reveal isoferulic acid (and possibly dihydroferulic acid) as novel markers of caffeoyl quinic acid metabolism.",1
"The absorption, metabolism and excretion of flavan-3-ols and procyanidins following the ingestion of a grape seed extract by rats Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.",1
"Primary and secondary metabolite composition of kernels from three cultivars of Portuguese chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) at different stages of industrial transformation Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was much less significant.",1
Effect of domestic processing and cooking methods on phytic acid and polyphenol contents of pea cultivars (Pisum sativum) All the pea varieties differed significantly (p < 0.05) in their phytic acid content. The field pea cultivars had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of phytic acid and polyphenols than those of vegetable pea varieties. All the domestic processing and cooking methods could reduce the contents of phytic acid and polyphenols but germination for 48 hours seemed to have a marked lowering effect on the levels of these antinutrients in peas.,1

"Antioxidant activity in common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Beans were pearled to evaluate the feasibility of increasing antioxidant activity and phenolic antioxidants. Phenolics were concentrated mostly in the hull fraction at about 56 mg of catechin equivalents per gram of sample. The methanolic extracts of the pearled bean samples were screened for antioxidant potential using the beta-carotene-linoleate and the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. The pearled material, also referred to as milled samples, exhibited antioxidant activity that correlated with phenolic content and inhibited DPPH significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Phenolics and antioxidant activities were also examined in chromatographic fractions of methanolic extracts of manually obtained hulls that represented a model used previously to ascertain antimutagenic activity. Fractions extracted with ethyl acetate/acetone and acetone displayed antioxidant activity, which implies potent free radical scavenging activity with antimutagenic activity.",1
"Identification and quantification of phenolic compounds in berries of Fragaria and Rubus species (family Rosaceae) High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by acid hydrolysis of the extracts.",0
"Urinary and plasma levels of resveratrol and quercetin in humans, mice, and rats after ingestion of pure compounds and grape juice The present study investigates the bioavailability of resveratrol and quercetin in humans, mice, and rats after oral ingestion of grape juice preparations or pure aglycones. Oral administration of resveratrol and quercetin to humans yielded detectable levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their derivatives in the plasma and urine. Urinary levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their metabolites were observed in human subjects receiving 600 and 1200 mL of grape juice, whereas quercetin metabolites were identified in urine samples even after receiving 200 mL of grape juice. The cumulative amounts of resveratrol and quercetin excreted in the urine of mice receiving concentrated grape juice for 4 days were 2.3 and 0.7% of the ingested doses, respectively. After i.g. administration of resveratrol to rats (2 mg/kg), up to 1.2 microM resveratrol was observed in the plasma. The study demonstrates that the glycoside forms of resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice are absorbed to a lesser extent than the aglycones.",0

"Development of a stable isotope dilution analysis with liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry detection for the quantitative analysis of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in foods and model systems A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative determination of the di- and trihydroxybenzenes catechol (1), pyrogallol (2), 3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder, bread crust, potato crisps, fruits, and cigarette smoke and human urine. Model precursor studies revealed the carbohydrate/amino acid systems as well as the plant polyphenols catechin and epicatechin as precursors of catechol and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid as a precursor of catechol and 4-ethylcatechol, and gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid as precursors of pyrogallol.",1
"Molecular definition of the taste of roasted cocoa nibs (Theobroma cacao) by means of quantitative studies and sensory experiments Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.",1

"Effect of extraction method on the concentrations of selected bioactive compounds in mandarin juice A mandarin-type citrus fruit, ponkan (Citrus reticulata), was processed by in-line, chopper pulper, and hand-press extractions to investigate the effect of extraction method on the concentrations of bioactive compounds in processed juice. Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line (8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the others. The inhibitory effect of hand-press juice extract on platelet cyclooxygenase activity was remarkable among juice extracts. All juice extracts effectively inhibited polymorphonuclear 5-lipoxygenase activity at nearly the same rate.",1
"Determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids of apple and pear by high-performance liquid chromatography A new HPLC stationary phase has been applied to the analysis of phenolic acids and flavonoids with diode array and mass spectrometric detection. The separation of 26 standard compounds was achieved within 1 h. The stationary phase displayed excellent resolution especially of flavonol glycosides. The analytical system has been used for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple pomace and apple juice, and in extracts of pear fruits of different cultivars. Apple pomace was found to be a promising source of phenolics. However, yields are affected by the drying conditions applied. Furthermore, the applicability of the analytical system for the authenticity control of apple and pear juice was demonstrated by determination of characteristic quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosides, and dihydrochalcones, respectively. Since isorhamnetin-3-glucoside was present in all pear cultivars investigated, the usefulness of arbutin as a specific marker of pear products appears to be doubtful.",1
"Possible role of plant phenolics in the production of trichothecenes by Fusarium graminearum strains on different fractions of maize kernels Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.",1
"Determination of Stilbenes (-viniferin, trans-astringin, trans-piceid, cis- and trans-resveratrol, -viniferin) in Brazilian Wines Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.",0

"Development of a quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection measurement system for phenolic acids A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.",0
"Variance of common flavonoids by brand of grapefruit juice Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, respectively.",0
"Black tea represents a major source of dietary phenolics among regular tea drinkers The phenolic composition and antioxidant activities [TEAC, ORAC, FRAP] of consumer brews (1 tea bag in 230 ml for 1 min) of seven different brands of black tea from the British market were investigated. The main phenolic compounds identified were epigallocatechin gallate, four theaflavins, as well as epicatechin gallate, theogallin (tentative assignment), quercetin-3-rutinoside and 4-caffeoyl quinic acid. Thearubigins represented an estimated 75-82% of the total phenolics. Further, polyphenol fractions were in decreasing order theaflavins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, gallic acids and hydroxycinnamates. On average, a cup of a consumer brew of black tea is providing polyphenols at the level of 262mg GAE/serving, of which 65 mg were assigned to individual polyphenols. The antioxidant activity of black tea preparations is higher than that of most reported dietary agents on a daily basis. Correlations were observed between the antioxidant activities and the sum of all quantified polyphenols by HPLC analysis as well as with the total phenolics. Treatment of the black tea brew with simulated gastric juice resulted in a significant increase of the identified theaflavins implying a partial cleavage of thearubigins in the environment of the gastric lumen. Therefore, black tea can be considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and/or antioxidants.",1

"Validation of a reversed phase high performance thin layer chromatographic-densitometric method for secoisolariciresinol diglucoside determination in flaxseed The validation of a HPTLC-densitometric method for the determination of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed was performed improving the reproducibility of a previously reported HPTLC densitometric procedure by the use of fully wettable reversed phase plates (silica gel 60 RP18W F(254S), 10cmx10cm) with MeOH:HCOOH 0.1% (40:60, v/v) mobile phase. The analysis required only the alkaline hydrolysis in aqueous medium of undefatted samples and densitometry at 282nm of HPTLC runs. The method was validated following the protocol proposed by the Société Francaise des Sciences et Techniques Pharmaceutiques (SFSTP) giving rise to a dependable and high throughput procedure well suited to routine application. SDG was quantified in the range of 321-1071ng with RSD of repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 3.61% and accuracy inside the acceptance limits. Flaxseed of five cultivars of different origin was elected as test-bed.",1
"Absorption, metabolism, and antioxidant effects of pomegranate (Punica granatum l.) polyphenols after ingestion of a standardized extract in healthy human volunteers The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo antioxidant effects.",1
"Structural identification of novel glucoside and glucuronide metabolites of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in mouse urine using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside metabolite of EGCG in mammals. Our results indicate that glucosidation represents a novel pathway in the metabolism of EGCG in mice.",0

"Survey of the Free and Conjugated Myricetin and Quercetin Content of Red Wines of Different Geographical Origins Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical regions.",0

"Effect of processing and storage on the stability of flaxseed lignan added to bakery products This study investigated the effects of processing and storage on the stability of purified, flaxseed-derived secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) added to milk prior to the manufacture of different dairy products. We analyzed the effect of high-temperature pasteurization, fermentation, and milk renneting as well as storage on the stability of SDG added to milk, yogurt, and cheese. Also, the stability of SDG in whey-based drinks was studied. Added SDG was found to withstand the studied processes well. In edam cheese manufacture, most of the added SDG was retained in the whey fraction and 6% was found in the cheese curd. SDG was also relatively stable in edam cheese during ripening of 6 weeks at 9 degrees C and in yogurt during storage of 21 days at 4 degrees C. Up to 25% of added SDG was lost in whey-based drinks during storage of 6 months at 8 degrees C. We conclude that SDG can be successfully supplemented in dairy-based products.",1
"Multivariate methods for characterization and classification of espresso coffees from different botanical varieties and types of roast by foam, taste, and mouthfeel Three espresso coffee (EC) samples of different botanical varieties and types of roast were prepared in standard conditions using an experimental EC prototype: Arabica coffee, Robusta Natural blend, and Robusta Torrefacto blend (a special roast by adding sugar). The ECs were characterized with regard to the physical parameters, amount of total solids, total solids on filtrate, lipids, caffeine, trigonelline, and chlorogenic acids by HPLC, and sensory descriptive analysis related to foam appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate the EC samples. Arabica and Robusta samples were separated successfully by principal component 1 (55.3% of variance) including physicochemical and sensory parameters related to foam and taste of ECs. Torrefacto and Robusta Natural EC samples were separated by principal component 2 (20.7% of total variance) including mouthfeel and other attributes of color foam. Some interesting correlations among sensory and physicochemical variables were found. A very simple discriminate function was obtained by discriminate analysis allowing the classification of each EC sample into its respective group with a success rate of 100%.",1
"Jam Processing and Storage Effects on Blueberry Polyphenolics and Antioxidant Capacity Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics and antioxidant capacity.",1
"Analysis of phenolic compounds in the evaluation of commercial quince jam authenticity The phenolic compounds present in 17 samples of Portuguese commercial and three homemade quince jams were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, to determine their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the complete definition of quince jams profiles, one of them including an Amberlite XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.",1
"Phase II-Inducing, Polyphenols Content and Antioxidant Capacity of Corn (Zea mays L.) from Phenotypes of White, Blue, Red and Purple Colors Processed into Masa and Tortillas White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching (PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and capacity to induce QR.",1
"Chemical composition of selected edible nut seeds Commercially important edible nut seeds were analyzed for chemical composition and moisture sorption. Moisture (1.47-9.51%), protein (7.50-21.56%), lipid (42.88-66.71%), ash (1.16-3.28%), total soluble sugars (0.55-3.96%), tannins (0.01-0.88%), and phytate (0.15-0.35%) contents varied considerably. Regardless of the seed type, lipids were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (>75% of the total lipids). Fatty acid composition analysis indicated that oleic acid (C18:1) was the main constituent of monounsaturated lipids in all seed samples. With the exception of macadamia, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the major polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the case of walnuts, in addition to linoleic acid (59.79%) linolenic acid (C18:3) also significantly contributed toward the total polyunsaturated lipids. Amino acid composition analyses indicated lysine (Brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, pine nut, and walnut), sulfur amino acids methionine and cysteine (almond), tryptophan (macadamia, pecan), and threonine (peanut) to be the first limiting amino acid as compared to human (2-5 year old) amino acid requirements. The amino acid composition of the seeds was characterized by the dominance of hydrophobic (range = 37.16-44.54%) and acidic (27.95-33.17%) amino acids followed by basic (16.16-21.17%) and hydrophilic (8.48-11.74%) amino acids. Trypsin inhibitory activity, hemagglutinating activity, and proteolytic activity were not detected in the nut seed samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms (Aw range = 0.08-0.97) indicated a narrow range for monolayer water content (11-29 mg/g of dry matter). No visible mold growth was evident on any of the samples stored at Aw < 0.53 and 25 degrees C for 6 months.",1
"The impact of packaging materials on the antioxidant phytochemical stability of aqueous infusions of green tea (Camellia sinensis) and Yaupon Holly (Ilex vomitoria) during cold storage Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.",1
"Isoflavone levels in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and Hawaii Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving sizes.",0
"Secoiridoids, tocopherols, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils extracted from destoned fruits The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.",1
"Antimutagenic, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity of ethyl acetate extracts from white, yellow and red onions The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.",1

"Ferulic acid dehydromers from wheat bran: isolation, purification and antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diferulic acid Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major dimers released were: trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), (Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid (5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.",0
"LC/MS/MS quantitation assay for pharmacokinetics of naringenin and double peaks phenomenon in rats plasma A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.",1
"Rapid, direct determination of polyphenols in tea by reversed-phase column liquid chromatography Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD are below 5%).",0
"Steryl phenolic acid esters in cereals and their milling fractions The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate sources.",0

"Chlorogenic acids and lactones in regular and water-decaffeinated arabica coffees The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final beverage, suggesting the need for further study.",1
"Consumption of both black tea and green tea results in an increase in the excretion of hippuric acid into urine A major portion of the catechins in green tea is not absorbed in the small intestine. Bacteria in the colon convert nonabsorbed catechins into simpler phenolic compounds, which may also be absorbed. During the production of black tea, most catechins are polymerized to complex molecules called thearubigins. Little is known about the microbial degradation of these complex polyphenols, but hippuric acid has been identified as a major excretion product associated with black tea consumption.",1
"Phenolic composition of strawberry genotypes at different maturation stages The effects of maturation (green, pink, and ripe) on phenolic composition of strawberry cultivars Camarosa, Dorit, Chandler, and Osmanli and their hybrids were investigated using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, ellagic acid, cyanidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin were individually quantified for each stage. The highest amounts of anthocyanins were obtained from ripe fruits whereas ellagic acid was found as the main phenolic in the green fruits. Phenolic concentrations were found statistically different in green and ripe fruits. One hybrid was found to have higher phenolic contents than the other genotypes. The p-hydroxybenzoic and p-coumaric acid levels changed during maturation, but no differences in contents of flavonoids in green and ripe fruit were detected.",1
"Capillary electrophoretic determination of resveratrol in wines A rapid and sensitive capillary electrophoretic method for analysis of resveratrol in wine was established. The protocol consists of sample preparation using a C-18 solid-phase extraction cartridge. Baseline separation of trans- and cis-resveratrol from other compounds in wine was achieved in approximately 8 min using a micellar mode. The limits of detection for trans- and cis-resveratrol were 0.1 and 0.15 micromol/L, respectively. Recovery rates for trans-resveratrol using the protocol described ranged from 94.6 +/- 8.5 to 101.9 +/- 7.2%. These procedures were used to analyze the trans- and cis-resveratrol levels in 26 wines. It was found that the concentration of trans-resveratrol ranged from 0.987 to 25.4 micromol/L, whereas the concentration of cis-resveratrol was much lower.",1
"High-performance thin-layer chromatographic-densitometric determination of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in flaxseed A HPTLC-densitometric method, based on an external standard approach, was developed in order to obtain a novel procedure for routine analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed with a minimum of sample pre-treatment. Optimization of TLC conditions for the densitometric scanning was reached by eluting HPTLC silica gel plates in a horizontal developing chamber. Quantitation of SDG was performed in single beam reflectance mode by using a computer-controlled densitometric scanner and applying a five-point calibration in the 1.00-10.00 microg/spot range. As no sample preparation was required, the proposed HPTLC-densitometric procedure demonstrated to be reliable, yet using an external standard approach. The proposed method is precise, reproducible and accurate and can be employed profitably in place of HPLC for the determination of SDG in complex matrices.",1
"Vitisin A content in Chilean wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and contribution to the color of aged red wines Vitisin A was prepared from malvidin 3-glucoside and pyruvic acid in model wine medium, isolated by countercurrent chromatography, and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The synthesized compound was used as a reference standard to quantify vitisin A in Chilean wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, including a vertical row of wines from the same vineyard over 16 years. Maximum vitisin A content was reached within the first year of storage. Importantly, up to half of the initial amount of vitisin A in young wines was still present in 15 year old wines. Although vitisin A was found to be much more stable as compared to other monomeric C-4 underivatized anthocyanins, it also slowly degrades after reaching its peak concentration. The ""color activity concept"" was applied to vitisin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, malvidin 3-(6' '-acetylglucoside), and polymeric pigments isolated by countercurrent chromatography in order to estimate their contribution toward the overall color expression of wines. It was found that vitisin A is only a minor contributor to the visually perceived color of aged red wines (color contribution approximately 5%). The major contributor is the polymeric fraction (color contribution approximately 70-90%).",1
"Structure-Antioxidant Efficiency Relationships of Phenolic Compounds and Their Contribution to the Antioxidant Activity of Sea Buckthorn Juice The phenolic composition of juice derived from fruits of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array and electrochemical detection. Flavonols were found to be the predominating polyphenols while phenolic acids and catechins represent minor components. Of the seven flavonols identified, isorhamnetin 3-O-glycosides were the most important representatives quantitatively. However, because of their structural properties, they were poor radical scavengers as shown by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Phenolic compounds such as quercetin 3-O-glycosides, catechins, and hydroxybenzoic acids with a catechol structure exhibited good antioxidant capacities, but their concentration in sea buckthorn juice was small. These phenolic compounds, determined by HPLC, accounted for less than 5% of the total antioxidant activity of the filtered juice. Ascorbic acid was shown to be the major antioxidant in sea buckthorn juice. Because of its high concentration of 1.22 g/L, it contributes approximately 75% to total antioxidant activity. The remaining difference can be attributed to higher molecular weight flavan-3-ols (proanthocyanidins), which were determined photometrically after acid depolymerization to colored anthocyanidins.",1
"Phenolics and betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta vulgaris) root: distribution and effect of cold storage on the content of total phenolics and three individual compounds The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and the main known ferulic acid ester (beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.",1

"Phenolic compounds, tocopherols and other minor components in virgin olive oils of some Tunisian varieties The phenols, α-tocopherols, fatty acids and oxidative stability of six monovarietal virgin olive oils (VOOs) were determined. Fourteen phenolic compounds were detected and quantified by solid phase extraction and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones were the main components in all samples. Pinoresinol was the most abundant component in lignan fraction. The total phenol content of these monovarietal oils varied from 66.82 mg/kg in ""Neb Jmel"" oil to 662.74 mg/kg in ""El Hor"" oil. A wide range of α-tocopherol contents was also noticed; it varied from 141.94 mg/kg in ""Semni"" variety to 364.23 mg/kg in ""Jdallou"" variety. With regard to pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids were found at variable concentrations: with median values of 11.33 and 3.10 mg/kg, respectively. Among the studied varieties, ""Oueslati"" and El Hor were characterized by the lowest levels of palmitic and linoleic acids and the highest values of oleic acid.",0
"Extraction and quantification of phytoestrogens in foods using automated solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.",1
"Influence of industrial processing on orange juice flavanone solubility and transformation to chalcones under gastrointestinal conditions Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble chalcones.",1
"HPLC-DAD-ESIMS analysis of phenolic compounds in nectarines, peaches, and plums The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl (350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant (125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially rich in phenolics.",0

"Determination of anthocyanidins in berries and red wine by high-performance liquid chromatography A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of anthocyanidins from berries and red wine is described. Delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and malvidin contents of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), black currant (Ribes nigrum), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa cv. Jonsok), and a Cabernet sauvignon (Vitis vinifera) red wine were determined. The aglycon forms of the anthocyanins present in the samples were revealed by acid hydrolysis. A reversed phase analytical column was employed to separate the anthocyanidins before identification by diode array detection. The suitability of the method was tested by determining the recovery (95-102% as aglycons and 69-104% from glycosides) for each anthocyanidin. Method repeatability was tested by charting the total aglycon content of two samples over a period of 14 analyses and determining the coefficients of variation (1.41% for bilberry and 2.56% for in-house reference material). The method developed proved thus to be effective for reliable determination of anthocyanidins from freeze-dried berry samples and red wine. The total anthocyanidin content of the tested samples was as follows: in-house reference material, 447 +/- 8 mg/100 g; strawberry, 23.8 +/- 0.4 mg/100 g; black currant, 135 +/- 3 mg/100 g; bilberry, 360 +/- 3 mg/100 g; and Cabernet sauvignon red wine, 26.1 +/- 0.1 mg/100 mL.",1

"High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of phenolic compounds in berries with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection: Ribes species High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric (MS) detection was used to study phenolic compounds in berries of black, green, red, and white currants (Ribes spp.). UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for the first time.",1
"Quantitation of polyphenols in different apple varieties Forty-one apple samples, representing eight of the most widely cultivated varieties in western Europe, were collected in Trentino, Italy. Samples were extracted from fresh fruit with a mixture of acetone/water to achieve a good extraction of polyphenols, including proanthocyanidin oligomers which were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC. Up to 20 compounds including catechin, epicatechin, B2 procyanidin, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, anthocyanins, and dihydrochalcones were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and LC-MS. Total polyphenol content was independently measured with an optimized Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The mean content of total polyphenols lay between 66.2 and 211.9 mg/100 g of FW depending on the variety. With chromatographic analysis, it was possible to explain the whole amount of total polyphenols measured by the FC assay. Flavanols (catechin and proanthocyanidins) are the major class of apple polyphenols (71-90%), followed by hydroxycinnamates (4-18%), flavonols (1-11%), dihydrochalcones (2-6%), and in red apples anthocyanins (1-3%).",0
"Influence of domestic processing and storage on flavonol contents in berries Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry (9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during storage.",1
"High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed by alkaline extraction A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside (1.6-5.0 mg/g).",1
"Berry phenolics and their antioxidant activity Phenolic profiles of a total of 26 berry samples, together with 2 apple samples, were analyzed without hydrolysis of glycosides with HPLC. The phenolic contents among different berry genera varied considerably. Anthocyanins were the main phenolic constituents in bilberry, bog-whortleberry, and cranberry, but in cowberries, belonging also to the family Ericaceae genus Vaccinium, flavanols and procyanidins predominated. In the family Rosaceae genus Rubus (cloudberry and red raspberry), the main phenolics found were ellagitannins, and in genus Fragaria (strawberry), ellagitannins were the second largest group after anthocyanins. However, phenolic acids were dominant in rowanberries (genus Sorbus) and anthocyanins in chokeberry (genus Aronia). In the family Grossulariaceae genus Ribes (currants and gooseberry), anthocyanins predominated, as well as in crowberries (family Empetraceae genus Empetrum). In apples, hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic subgroup. Extraction methods for berries and apples were studied to produce phenolic extracts with high antioxidant activity. Evaluation of antioxidant activity was performed by autoxidazing methyl linoleate (40 degrees C, in the dark). The extraction method affected remarkably both the phenolic composition and the antioxidant activity, but with statistical analysis the observed activity could not be well explained with the contents of individual phenolic subgroups.",1
"Catechin Contents of Foods Commonly Consumed in The Netherlands. 1. Fruits, Vegetables, Staple Foods, and Processed Foods Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially beneficial to human health. To enable epidemiological evaluation of these compounds, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 24 types of fruits, 27 types of vegetables and legumes, some staple foods, and processed foods commonly consumed in The Netherlands. Most fruits, chocolate, and some legumes contained catechins. Levels varied to a large extent: from 4.5 mg/kg in kiwi fruit to 610 mg/kg in black chocolate. (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin were the predominant catechins; GC, EGC, and ECg were detected in some foods, but none of the foods contained EGCg. The data reported here provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic diseases.",1
"Pharmacokinetics in mice and growth-inhibitory properties of the putative cancer chemopreventive agent resveratrol and the synthetic analogue trans 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.",1

"Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their tannin content using the proposed method.",0

"A metabolite profiling approach to identify biomarkers of flavonoid intake in humans Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.",0
"Levels of stilbene oligomers and astilbin in French varietal wines and in grapes during noble rot development Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.",1
"Quantitative analysis of flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables and beverages by high-performance liquid chromatography with photo-diode array and mass spectrometric detection A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with photo-diode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection was developed to determine and quantify flavonols, flavones, and flavanones in fruits, vegetables and beverages. The compounds were analysed as aglycones, obtained after acid hydrolysis of freeze-dried food material. Identification was based on retention time, UV and mass spectra by comparison with commercial standards, and the UV peak areas were used for quantitation of the flavonoid contents. Examples of HPLC-MS, analyses of orange pulp, tomato, and apple are presented. The method has been used to screen foods on the Danish market, and the contents of flavones, flavonols, and flavanones were measured.",0
"Influence of cultivar, maturity, and sampling on blackberry (Rubus L. hybrids) anthocyanins, polyphenolics, and antioxidant properties Total anthocyanin pigments increased from 74.7 to 317 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW) from underripe to overripe for Marion blackberries and from 69.9 to 164 mg/100 g FW for Evergreen blackberries. Total phenolics did not show a marked change with maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant activities, while increasing with ripening, also did not show the marked change that total anthocyanins exhibited. The impact of variation due to plots, subsampling, sample preparation, and measurement on Marion composition was examined in detail. Plot-to-plot and sample differences were the major contributors to variation, with sample preparation being an important contributor for some parameters. Measurement variation was a relatively small component of the total variation. Total anthocyanins for 11 blackberry cultivars ranged from 131 to 256 mg/100 g FW (mean = 198), total phenolics ranged from 682 to 1056 mg GAE/100 g FW (mean = 900), oxygen radical absorbance capacity ranged from 37.6 to 75.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 50.2), and ferric reducing antioxidant power ranged from 63.5 to 91.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 77.5).",1

"Antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin contents of selected commercially available cocoa-containing and chocolate products in the United States In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing products in the United States.",1

"Absorption, tissue distribution and excretion of pelargonidin and its metabolites following oral administration to rats Recent reports have demonstrated various cardiovascular and neurological benefits associated with the consumption of foods rich in anthocyanidins. However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue distribution are only beginning to accumulate. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels reaching 0.5 and 0.15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the overall uptake of the administered pelargonidin was 18 % after 2 h, with the majority of the detected levels located in the stomach. However, the amounts recovered dropped to 1.2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered pelargonidin.",1
"Identification and characterization of methylated and ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins formed in humans, mice, and rats (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant tea catechin, has been proposed to be beneficial to human health based on its strong antioxidative and other biological activities in vitro. Inadequate knowledge regarding the bioavailability and biotransformation of EGCG in humans, however, has limited our understanding of its possible beneficial health effects. In this study, 4',4' '-di-O-methyl-EGCG (4',4' '-DiMeEGCG) was detected in human plasma and urine by LC/MS/MS following green tea ingestion. Both 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG reached peak plasma values (20.5 +/- 7.7 and 145.4 +/- 31.6 nM, respectively, in 4 subjects) at 2 h after the dose. The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. (-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another possible ring-fission metabolite, (-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.",1

"Phase I dose escalation pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers of resveratrol, a potential cancer chemopreventive agent The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.",1
"Effect of processing on the phytochemical profiles and antioxidant activity of corn for production of masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.",0

A total of 35 volatiles were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.",1
"Black tea represents a major source of dietary phenolics among regular tea drinkers The phenolic composition and antioxidant activities [TEAC, ORAC, FRAP] of consumer brews (1 tea bag in 230 ml for 1 min) of seven different brands of black tea from the British market were investigated. The main phenolic compounds identified were epigallocatechin gallate, four theaflavins, as well as epicatechin gallate, theogallin (tentative assignment), quercetin-3-rutinoside and 4-caffeoyl quinic acid. Thearubigins represented an estimated 75-82% of the total phenolics. Further, polyphenol fractions were in decreasing order theaflavins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, gallic acids and hydroxycinnamates. On average, a cup of a consumer brew of black tea is providing polyphenols at the level of 262mg GAE/serving, of which 65 mg were assigned to individual polyphenols. The antioxidant activity of black tea preparations is higher than that of most reported dietary agents on a daily basis. Correlations were observed between the antioxidant activities and the sum of all quantified polyphenols by HPLC analysis as well as with the total phenolics. Treatment of the black tea brew with simulated gastric juice resulted in a significant increase of the identified theaflavins implying a partial cleavage of thearubigins in the environment of the gastric lumen. Therefore, black tea can be considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and/or antioxidants.",0

"Steryl phenolic acid esters in cereals and their milling fractions The steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains and their milling fractions were analyzed using a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat bran or pearling dust of barley. The results indicated that rye and wheat and especially their bran fractions are comparable to corn as steryl ferulate sources.",1

"Changes in the phytochemical composition and profile of raw, boiled, and roasted peanuts Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not observed in the raw peanut extracts.",1
"Nondestructive determination of lignans and lignan glycosides in sesame seeds by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 (coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs for high quality sesame.",1
"Quercetin from shallots (Allium cepa L. var. aggregatum) is more bioavailable than its glucosides The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 +/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to the food matrix as a key factor.",1
"Effect of drying of figs (Ficus carica L.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, and phenolic compounds Fresh figs were subjected to two different drying processes: sun-drying and oven-drying. To assess their effect on the nutritional and health-related properties of figs, sugars, organic acids, single phenolics, total phenolics, and antioxidant activity were determined before and after processing. Samples were analyzed three times in a year, and phenolic compounds were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). In figs, monomer sugars predominate, which is important nutritional information, and the content of sugars as well as organic acids in fresh figs was lower than in dried fruits. However, the best sugar/organic acid ratio was measured after the sun-drying process. Analysis of individual phenolic compounds revealed a higher content of all phenolic groups determined after the oven-drying process, with the exception of cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside. Similarly, higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were detected after the drying process. With these results it can be concluded that the differences in analyzed compounds in fresh and dried figs are significant. The differences between the sun-dried and oven-dried fruits were determined in organic acids, sugars, chlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, luteolin-8-C-glucoside, and total phenolic contents. The results indicate that properly dried figs can be used as a good source of phenolic compounds.",1
"Metabolism of phenolic compounds during loquat fruit development Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.",0

"Identification and antioxidant activity of flavonoid metabolites in plasma and urine of eriocitrin-treated rats Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.",1
"Factors affecting the caffeine and polyphenol contents of black and green tea infusions The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared according to the instructions given on their packaging.",1

"Isolation and identification of urinary metabolites of kakkalide in rats Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone (M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), 5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A (M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13).

"Chlorogenic acid bioavailability largely depends on its metabolism by the gut microflora in rats Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites (ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.",0
"Urinary excretion of 13 dietary flavonoids and phenolic acids in free-living healthy subjects - variability and possible use as biomarkers of polyphenol intake Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment methods.

"Metabolic profiling of flavonol metabolites in human urine by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry Twenty-one flavonol metabolites have been identified by LC/ESI-MS/MS in human urine, including isomers, after the consumption of cooked onions. Metabolites identified include quercetin monoglucuronides, methyl quercetin monoglucuronides, a quercetin monoglucuronide sulfate, quercetin diglucuronides, a methyl quercetin diglucuronide, quercetin glucoside sulfates, methyl quercetin, quercetin, and kaempferol monoglucuronides. The fragmentation patterns of flavonol metabolites obtained by MS/MS were distinctive for some isomers, indicating that fragmentation patterns may be useful predictors of conjugation position. Two isomers of sulfate quercetin glucosides were also found in urine, suggesting that many of the quercetin glucosides in onion are absorbed intact and undergo metabolism to the sulfate conjugate. Additionally, the interindividual variation in urinary quercetin metabolite profiles was determined by comparing the relative level of six different quercetin metabolites excreted in the urine of healthy volunteers. The ranges of quercetin metabolites excreted were similar among volunteers, yet notable differences in the levels of metabolites among individuals were observed. This study demonstrates the potential of monitoring the range of quercetin metabolites to reveal information on interindividual biotransformation capacity in response to dietary manipulations and as a biomarker for flavonol consumption.",1
"Phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of Georgia-grown blueberries and blackberries Blueberries and blackberries grown at various locations in Georgia were collected and analyzed for flavonoids, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols, and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Each sample was analyzed for phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and ellagic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array detection was used for analysis. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on retention time and UV spectra by comparison with pure commercial standards. Phenolic acids ranged from 0.19 to 258.90 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), and flavonoids ranged from 2.50 to 387.48 mg/100 g FW. Total polyphenols ranged from 261.95 to 929.62 mg/100 g FW, and total anthocyanins ranged from 12.70 to 197.34 mg/100 g FW. TEAC values varied from 8.11 to a maximum of 38.29 microM/g FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are rich sources of antioxidants.",0
"Effects of Roasting on Taste-Active Compounds of TurkisH Hazelnut Varieties (Corylus avellana L.) The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due to the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic acids was not noteworthy.",1
"Red wine anthocyanins are rapidly absorbed in humans and affect monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels and antioxidant capacity of plasma Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.",1

"Identification of metabolites of tectoridin in-vivo and in-vitro by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry In this work, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem ion-trap mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) was used to investigate the in-vivo and in-vitro metabolism of tectoridin. After oral administration of a single dose (100 mg kg(-1)) of tectoridin to healthy rats, faeces and urine samples were collected for 0-48 h and 0-24 h, respectively. Tectoridin was also incubated with rat intestinal flora and rat liver microsomes. Samples from in-vivo and in-vitro metabolism studies were purified using a C(18) solid-phase extraction cartridge, then separated using a reverse-phase C(18) column with methanol/ water (30:70, v/v, adjusted to pH 10.0 with ammonia water) as mobile phase and detected by an on-line MS(n) system. The structure of the metabolites was elucidated by comparing their molecular weights, retention times and full-scan MS(n) spectra with those of the parent drug. The results revealed six metabolites of tectoridin in urine (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin, glucuronide-conjugated tectorigenin and sulfate-conjugated tectorigenin); three metabolites in faeces (tectorigenin, di-hydroxylated tectorigenin and sulfateconjugated tectorigenin); one metabolite in the intestinal flora incubation mixture (tectorigenin), and four in the liver microsomal incubation mixture (tectorigenin, hydrogenated tectorigenin, mono-hydroxylated tectorigenin and di-hydroxylated tectorigenin). Except for tectorigenin, all other metabolites of tectoridin are reported for the first time.",1
"Quantification of lignans in food using isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease prevention.",0
"Quantification of polyphenolics and their antioxidant capacity in fresh plums Total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of 11 cultivars of fresh plums were determined using spectrophotometric methods. Identification and quantification of individual polyphenolics were performed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector. The total phenolic contents of various cultivars widely varied from 125.0 to 372.6 mg/100 g expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The level of total flavonoids in fresh plums ranged between 64.8 and 257.5 mg/100 g expressed as catechin equivalents. Antioxidant capacity, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), ranged from 204.9 to 567.0 mg/100 g with an average of 290.9 mg/100 g of fresh weight. Cv. Beltsville Elite B70197 showed the highest amounts of total phenolics and total flavonoids and the highest VCEAC. A positive relationship (correlation coefficient r (2)() = 0.977) was presented between total phenolics and VCEAC, suggesting polyphenolics would play an important role in free radical scavenging. The level of IC(50) value of superoxide radical anion scavenging activity of the plum cultivars ranged from 13.4 to 45.7 mg of VCEAC/100 g. Neochlorogenic acid was the predominant polyphenolic among fresh plums tested. Flavonols found in plum were commonly quercetin derivatives. Rutin was the most predominant flavonol in plums. Various anthocyanins containing cyanidin aglycon and peonidin aglycon were commonly found in all plums except for cv. Mirabellier and NY 101.",0
"A liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QTOF)-based metabolomic approach reveals new metabolic effects of catechin in rats fed high-fat diets Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.",0
"Monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines and grapes from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet Sauvignon The monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric flavan-3-ol composition of wines, grape seeds, and skins from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Graciano, Tempranillo, and Cabernet Sauvignon has been studied using (1) fractionation by polyamide column chromatography followed by HPLC/ESI-MS analysis, (2) fractionation on C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges followed by reaction with vanillin and acid-catalyzed degradation in the presence of toluene-alpha-thiol (thiolysis). The content of monomers ((+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin), procyanidin dimers (B3, B1, B4, and B2), trimers (T2 and C1), and dimer gallates (B2-3-O-gallate, B2-3'-O-gallate, and B1-3-O-gallate) ranged from 76.93 to 133.18 mg/L in wines, from 2.30 to 8.21 mg/g in grape seeds, and from 0.14 to 0.38 mg/g in grape skins. In wines, the polymeric fraction represented 77-84% of total flavan-3-ols and showed a mean degree of polymerization (mDP) value of 6.3-13.0. In grapes, the polymeric fraction represented 75-81% of total flavan-3-ols in seeds and 94-98% in skins and showed mDP values of 6.4-7.3 in seeds and 33.8-85.7 in skins. All the monomeric flavan-3-ols and oligomeric procyanidins found in wines were also present in seeds, although differences in their relative abundances were seen. The skin polymeric proanthocyanidins participated in the equilibration of the wine polymeric proanthocyanidin fraction, especially contributing to the polymer subunit composition and mDP.",1
"Viscous food matrix influences absorption and excretion but not metabolism of blackcurrant anthocyanins in rats The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a simultaneous intake of food and anthocyanins (ACNs) on ACN absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Blackcurrant ACNs (BcACNs) were dissolved in water with or without the addition of oatmeal and orally administered to rats, providing approximately 250 mg total ACNs per kilogram BW. Blood, urine, digesta, and tissue samples of the stomach, jejunum, and colon were subsequently collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 24 h. Identification and quantification of ACNs were carried out by Reversed phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Four major ACNs were present in the blackcurrant extract: delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside. In plasma, the 4 ACNs of blackcurrant were identified and quantified. The time to reach maximal total ACN plasma concentration (C(max) BcACN/water = 0.37 +/- 0.07 micromol/L; C(max) BcACN/oatmeal = 0.20 +/- 0.05 micromol/L) occurred faster after BcACN/water (t(max)= 0.25 h), than after BcACN/oatmeal administration (t(max)= 1.0 h). In digesta and tissue samples, the 4 original blackcurrant ACNs were detected. The relative concentration of rutinosides in the digesta increased during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract, while the glucosides decreased. Maximum ACN excretion in urine occurred later after BcACN/oatmeal than after BcACN/water administration (3 compared with 2 h). The 4 original ACNs of blackcurrant in their unchanged form, as well as several metabolites, were identified in the urine samples of both groups. The simultaneous intake of food affects ACN absorption and excretion in the urine, but not metabolism.",1
"Antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice and its relationship with phenolic composition and processing The antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices was evaluated by four different methods (ABTS, DPPH, DMPD, and FRAP) and compared to those of red wine and a green tea infusion. Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity (18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.",1
"Determination of free and total phenolic acids in plant-derived foods by HPLC with diode-array detection A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify free and total phenolic acids (m-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid) in plant foods. Free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and 10% acetic acid. Bound phenolic acids were liberated using first alkaline and then acid hydrolysis followed by extraction with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate (1:1). All fractions were quantified separately by HPLC. After HPLC quantification, results of alkali and acid hydrolysates were calculated to represent total phenolic acids. Ellagic acid was quantified separately after long (20 h) acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the determination of phenolic acids in plant foods. DAD response was linear for all phenolic acids within the ranges evaluated, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.999. Coefficients of variation for 4-8 sample replicates were consistently below 10%. Recovery tests of phenolic acids were performed for every hydrolysis condition using several samples. Recoveries were generally good (mean >90%) with the exceptions of gallic acid and, in some cases, caffeic acid samples.",1
"Antioxidant effectiveness as influenced by phenolic content of fresh orange juices Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular biomolecules.",1
"Isoflavone aglycon and glucoconjugate content of high- and low-soy UK foods used in nutritional studies The isoflavone aglycon and glucoconjugate content of commercially prepared and ""home-prepared"" high- and low-soy foods selected for use in an on-going nutritional study were measured by LC-MS. The daidzin, daidzein, 6""-O-malonyldaidzin, 6""-O-acetyldaidzin, genistein, genistin, 6""-O-malonylgenistin, 6""-O-acetylgenistin, glycitin, glycitein, 6""-O-malonylglycitin, and 6""-O-acetylglycitin content are expressed in terms of individual isoflavones, total isoflavone equivalents, and milligrams of isoflavones per portion served. Soybeans (774 mg x kg(-1) total isoflavones) and soybean-containing foods had the highest isoflavone content of the foods examined. The low-soy foods all contained very low concentrations (<8 mg x kg(-1) total isoflavones) of the isoflavone aglycons and glucoconjugates. High- and low-soy 11 day rotating menus were constructed from the analyzed foods to deliver 100.0 and 0.5 mg of isoflavones per day, respectively.",1
"Occurrence of flavonols in tomatoes and tomato-based products The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of free flavonols.",1
"Total phenol, catechin, and caffeine contents of teas commonly consumed in the United Kingdom Levels of total phenol, catechins, and caffeine in teas commonly consumed in the United Kingdom have been determined using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect in various population groups.",0

"Characterization of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in some cultivars of Ribes, Aronia, and Sambucus and their antioxidant capacity Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.",0
"Identification and quantification of low molecular weight phenolic antioxidants in seeds of evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L.) Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, respectively.",0
"Effect of drying conditions and storage period on polyphenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and ascorbic acid of prunes In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.",0
"Metabolomics provide new insight on the metabolism of dietary phytochemicals in rats Foods of plant origin contain a large number of phytochemicals that may positively affect health. Phytochemicals are largely excreted in urine as metabolites that are formed in host tissues or by the microbiota and constitute a great proportion of the urinary metabolome. The latter can be characterized by a metabolomics approach. In this work, we compared the metabolism of lignins to that of the structurally related ferulic acid (FA) and sinapic acid (SA). Five groups of rats (n = 5) were fed for 2 d a purified diet alone [control (C)] or supplemented with lignin-enriched wheat bran (3% of the diet, wt:wt), poplar wood lignins (0.42%), FA (0.42%), or SA (0.42%). The metabolomes of urine samples collected after 1 and 2 d of supplementation were analyzed by high-resolution MS (liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight). Comparing metabolic fingerprints by gathering semiquantitative information on several hundreds of metabolites and using multivariate statistical analysis (partial least squares for discriminant analysis) showed the similarity between both lignin-supplemented and C groups and confirmed that lignins are largely inert and not absorbed in the body. One the other hand, metabolic fingerprints of the 2 phenolic acid-supplemented groups were clearly distinct from the C group. Differences between the groups were mainly from nonmetabolized FA and SA and metabolites excreted in urine. Thirteen of them were identified as sulfate esters and glucuronide and glycine conjugates of the same phenolic acids, and of dihydrosinapic, vanillic, and benzoic acids. This study shows that metabolomics allows the identification of new metabolites of phytochemicals and can be used to distinguish individuals fed different phytochemical-containing foods.",1
"Flavonoids in baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.): changes during plant growth and storage The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds enhanced.",0
"The potent in vitro antioxidant ellagitannins from pomegranate juice are metabolised into bioavailable but poor antioxidant hydroxy-6H-dibenzopyran-6-one derivatives by the colonic microflora of healt The antiatherogenic activity of pomegranate juice has been attributed to its antioxidant polyphenols.

"trans-Resveratrol, quercetin, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin content in south Italian monovarietal wines: relationship with maceration time and marc pressing during winemaking The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese was observed.",1
"Oxidative metabolites of the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone in rat bile and urine Recent studies have shown that the mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) are biotransformed in vitro by hepatic microsomes from rats and humans to various metabolites carrying one additional hydroxy group either at the aromatic or at the aliphatic moiety. To clarify whether these metabolites are also formed in vivo, each lignan was administered intraduodenally at a dose of 10 mg/kg of bw to bile duct-catheterized female Wistar rats and the 6 h bile analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. With END-dosed rats, three products of aromatic and two of aliphatic monohydroxylation were found, whereas six aromatic and five aliphatic monohydroxylated biliary metabolites were detected after administration of ENL. The metabolites hydroxylated at the aromatic rings were unequivocally identified by comparison with synthetic reference compounds. The structures of the in vivo metabolites arising from aliphatic hydroxylation could not be completely elucidated; they were identical with some of the formerly reported microsomal products according to GC retention times and mass spectra. Significant amounts of most of the metabolites of the mammalian lignans identified in bile were also found in the urine of female rats after oral administration of 10 mg/kg of bw END or ENL and in the urine of female and male Wistar rats after they had been fed a diet containing 5% flaxseed. Thus, the mammalian lignans END and ENL give rise to several hydroxylated metabolites in vivo, which may contribute to the biological effects of these important food constituents.",0
"Identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in rat urine by HPLC-MS(n) This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found and identified in rat urine for the first time.",0
"Antioxidant activity of some foods containing phenolic compounds This study was designed to determine the total phenols (TP) and total antioxidant activity (TAA) of some liquid and solid plant foods that are commonly consumed in Turkey. Total phenols were analysed according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method and antioxidant activities of these compounds in aqueous phase were assessed by measuring their direct ABTS.- radical scavenging abilities. Total phenols varied from 68 to 4162 mg/l for liquid foods and from 735 to 3994 mg/kg for solid foods. TAA of liquid and solid foods ranged between 0.61-6.78 mM and 0.63-8.62 mM, respectively. Total antioxidant activities of foods were well correlated with total phenols (r2 = 0.95). According to content of total phenols per serving, liquid foods were in the order of black tea > instant coffee > coke > red wine > violet carrot juice > apricot nectar > Turkish coffee > grape molasses > sage > white wine > linden flower, and solid foods were in the order of red grape > raisins > tarhana > dried black plum > dried apricot > grape > fresh paprika > fresh black plum > Urtica sp. > cherry > fresh apricot > paprika pickle > paprika paste.",1
"Characterization of Phenolic Profiles of Northern European Berries by Capillary Electrophoresis and Determination of their Antioxidant Activity Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, and morin.",1

"Urinary lignan and isoflavonoid excretion in premenopausal women consuming flaxseed powder Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids (daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan matairesinol with flaxseed. Excretion was not altered by phase of menstrual cycle or duration of flaxseed consumption.",1
"Influence of cooking process on phenolic marker compounds of vegetables Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts consumed are therefore overestimated.",1
"Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tatricum Gaertn.) as a source of dietary rutin and quercitrin Two samples of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) from China and one from Luxembourg were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to reveal the possibilities of growing tartary buckwheat herb as a possible source of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin. The content of rutin was determined as up to 3% dry weight (DW) in tartary buckwheat herb. Quercitrin values were in the range of 0.01-0.05% DW. Only traces of quercetin were detected in just some of the samples. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained more rutin (about 0.8-1.7% DW) than common buckwheat seeds (0.01% DW). Rutin and quercetin content in seeds depends on variety and growing conditions. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained traces of quercitrin and quercetin, which were not found in common buckwheat seeds.",1
"Polyphenol profiles of apple juices Focusing on 17 constituents, the polyphenol profiles of juices freshly made from various dessert (n = 4) and cider apple cultivars (n = 7) as well as commercially available apple juices (n = 24) were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and (HPLC)-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI(neg)-MS/MS) analyses. Significant differences in the total polyphenol content as well as the profiles of the apple cultivars under study were observed. For dessert apples the total polyphenol content ranged from 154 to 178 mg/L, whereas for 'old' German cider apple cultivars 261-970 mg/L were determined. Boskoop showed the highest (970 mg/L) and Granny Smith the lowest (154 mg/L) polyphenol content of the freshly prepared samples under study. Hydroxycinnamic acids, with chlorogenic acid as dominating constituent, ranged from 57 to 68 mg/L as well as from 134-593 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that from cider apples, respectively. Dessert apple juices showed lower contents of dihydrochalcones (10-35 mg/L) and flavan-3-ols (50-95 mg/L) compared to that of cider apples (34-171 mg/L and 70-393 mg/L, respectively). Quercetin and its derivatives were found from 0.4-4 mg/L and 0.4-27 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that of cider apples, respectively. Compared with freshly made juices, lower contents of polyphenols were determined in the commercial samples under study. Amounts ranging from 110-459 mg/L, dominated by chlorogenic acid with concentrations from 53-217 mg/L, were determined. Information about cultivar-typical apple polyphenol content and profile is important for bioactivity studies and, consequently, essential for the development of consumer-relevant products with particular nutritional functionalities.",1
"Solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry determination of kaempferol and quercetin in human urine after consumption of Ginkgo biloba tablets A method was developed for the quantification of the flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol in human urine using a solid-phase extraction procedure followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Deuterated internal standards of the analytes were spiked into the samples prior to extraction. The limit of detection of the method was ca. 10 pg on column and precision of the method for quantification in a sample of urine was +/-9.40% for kaempferol and +/-7.34% for quercetin (n = 6). The levels of quercetin and kaempferol found in urine samples were only a small fraction of the amount ingested. The treatment of urine samples with beta-glucuronidase markedly increased the levels of flavonoids detected, supporting the view that kaempferol and quercetin are eliminated in the urine as glucuronides.",1
"Characterization of isoflavones and their conjugates in female rat urine using LC/MS/MS Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.",1
"Antioxidant phenols in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flour: comparative spectrophotometric study among extraction methods of free and bound phenolic compounds Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices (absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts (scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.",1

The Cerezlik 5025 peanut (1.92 +/- 0.01 microg/g) and Ohadi pistachio genotype (1.67 +/- 0.01 microg/g) had significantly higher trans-resveratrol contents. Peanuts contained 0.03-1.92 microg/g (av = 0.84 microg/g) of trans-resveratrol, whereas pistachio contained 0.09-1.67 microg/g (av = 1.15 microg/g). With exposure to UV light for 1 min, trans-resveratrol concentrations of samples ranged from 0.02 to 1.47 microg/g and those of cis-resveratrol from 0.008 to 0.32 microg/g. The occurrence of resveratrol in peanut and pistachio was confirmed by total ion chromatograms (TIC) of bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide derivatives of resveratrol isomers and comparison of the mass spectral fragmentation data with those of a resveratrol standard. Formation of the cis-isomer in pistachios was higher than in peanuts.",0

"Tissue distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rat Sesame exhibits many beneficial physiological effects, which are mostly related to its lignan compounds, such as sesaminol glucosides. This investigation studies the distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside from sesame in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In order to investigate the distribution of sesaminol triglucoside (p.o. 500 mg/kg) in SD rats, the changes in concentration of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites were determined in tissues and plasma within 24 h period after tube-feeding to SD rats. Results showed that sesaminol triglucoside may be deglycosylated to form sesaminol first by intestinal microflora and then incorporated via lymphatic absorption into the cardiovascular system, transported to other tissues. The concentrations of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rectum, caecum, colon, and small intestines are higher than those in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. Its concentration in brain is low but detectable. Glucuronidation and sulfation was the main metabolic pathway for sesaminol in urine, and fecal elimination was a major route of elimination. From LC/MS/MS analysis of rat organs, sesaminol triglucoside can be converted to mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END), and enterolactone (ENL), by rat intestinal microflora. In the plasma, concentrations of END and ENL were 5.9 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 micromol/mL, respectively.",1

"Flavonoid metabolites in human plasma and urine after the consumption of red onions: analysis by liquid chromatography with photodiode array and full scan tandem mass spectrometric detection Blood was collected from six human volunteers 1 h after the ingestion of lightly fried red onions, which are rich in anthocyanins and flavonols. Urine excreted 0-4 h after ingestion was also collected. Plasma and urine were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC with photodiode array and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Twenty-three flavonols as a range of mixed sulphate, methyl, glucuronide and glucoside derivatives of quercetin were detected. The availability of reference compounds facilitated the identification of quercetin-3-glucuronide. quercetin-3'-glucuronide, quercetin-4'-glucuronide, quercetin-3'-sulphate and isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide in samples from all volunteers. Samples from one volunteer also contained trace amounts of quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-glucoside and the aglycone quercetin. Despite a high dosage, neither anthocyanins nor anthocyanin metabolites accumulated in either plasma or urine in detectable quantities.",1
"Effect of processing on the flavonoid content in buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) grain Six flavonoids have been isolated and identified in buckwheat grain. These are rutin, orientin, vitexin, quercetin, isovitexin, and isoorientin. Rutin and isovitexin are the only flavonoid components of buckwheat seeds while hulls contain all six identified compounds. The total flavonoid concentration in the seeds was 18.8 and in the hulls 74 mg/100 g of dry matter. Dehulling the grain by using different temperature regimes resulted in drastic reductions of the total flavonoid concentration in the grain (by 75% of the control) and smaller but significant (15-20%) reduction in the hulls.",1
"Anthocyanin excretion by humans increases linearly with increasing strawberry dose A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.",0
"High-amylose corn exhibits better antioxidant activity than typical and waxy genotypes The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) corn genotypes.",0
"Identification of flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans (Vigna sinensis) by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.",0
"Effect of processing and storage on the antioxidant ellagic acid derivatives and flavonoids of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) jams From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.",0
"Composition and stability of anthocyanins in blue-grained wheat Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential end uses.",1

"Comparison of sample preparation methods for analysis of isoflavones in foodstuffs Due to the lack of one universally applicable and commonly used reference method, sample preparation in isoflavone (IF) analysis has been performed by many different methods which renders comparison and quality assessment of published IF contents in foodstuffs difficult. In the present work, the impact of different experimental parameters on the IF concentrations determined in soybeans, tofu, soy drink and textured vegetable protein by different extraction and hydrolysis methods was assessed and IF contents obtained by optimized orthogonal methods were compared. Chromatographic analysis was performed by HPLC-UV-ESI-MS. If possible sources of error - which are also pointed out in this work - are avoided, IF contents obtained by extraction, acid-, base- and enzymatic hydrolysis are similar. However, these sample preparation methods differ in the amount of time, standard compounds and instruments required, ruggedness, and in their applicability to analysis of complex composite samples containing soy as minor ingredient. Enzymatic hydrolysis with Helix pomatia juice after extraction by sonication with first 50, then 80% aqueous acetonitrile in the presence of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and after adjustment to </=10% organic solvent turned out to be the method of choice if only aglucone equivalent contents are required. The advantages of this method are short chromatographic run times, smallest danger of coelution, lowest achievable limits of quantitation and therefore best suitability for work-up of complex composite samples and that only aglucone standards are needed for quantitation.",1
"Polyphenolic composition of raisins The polyphenolics of raisins were extracted, separated by HPLC, and characterized by their UV-vis spectra, and their concentrations measured. Color measurements and browning indices were also determined. Samples (n = 20) included sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins. Comparisons were also made with fresh and frozen Thompson Seedless grapes. Golden raisins (which are treated with SO(2)) had the highest amount of hydroxycinnamic acids and the highest lightness values. In comparison with fresh grapes, percent losses of the two major hydroxycinnamics (caftaric and coutaric acids) in sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins were on the order of 90%. Flavonols were not influenced by processing as much as hydroxycinnamics, while procyanidins and flavan-3-ols were completely degraded in all raisin samples. Formation of hydroxymethylfurfural and loss of amino acids in sun-dried and dipped raisins are ascribed to Maillard browning reactions.",0
"Identification of isomeric flavonoid glucuronides in urine and plasma by metal complexation and LC-ESI-MS/MS Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.",1

Previously, we have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the direct simultaneous analysis of the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols using single sample analysis. This method can also be used for thorough investigations of the metabolite profiles of many other dietary constituents.",1

"Comparison of the total phenolic and ascorbic acid content of freeze-dried and air-dried marionberry, strawberry, and corn grown using conventional, organic, and sustainable agricultural practices Secondary phenolic metabolites play an important role in plant defense mechanisms, and increasing evidence indicates that many are important in human health. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of various agricultural practices on levels of secondary plant metabolites. To address this issue, the total phenolic (TP) content of marionberries, strawberries, and corn grown by sustainable, organic, or conventional cultural practices were measured. Additionally, the effects of three common postharvest processing treatments (freezing, freeze-drying, and air-drying) on the TP content of these agricultural products were also investigated. Statistically higher levels of TPs were consistently found in organically and sustainably grown foods as compared to those produced by conventional agricultural practices. In all samples, freeze-drying preserved higher levels of TPs in comparison with air-drying.",1

"Lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities of common foods in the United States Both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) assay with fluorescein as the fluorescent probe and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride as a peroxyl radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, spices, cereals, infant, and other foods. Most of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORAC(FL) values (H-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.87 to 2641 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, whereas lipophilic ORAC(FL) values (L-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 micromol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORAC(FL) values were <10% of the H-ORAC(FL) values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated by combining L-ORAC(FL) and H-ORAC(FL). Differences of ORAC(FL) values in fruits and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods to evaluate the impact of processing on ORAC(FL). The data demonstrated that processing can have significant effects on ORAC(FL). Considering all of the foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORAC(FL) showed a very weak correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996).",1

"Gallic acid metabolites are markers of black tea intake in humans Gallic acid is one of the main phenolic components of black tea. The objective of this study was to identify urinary gallic acid metabolites with potential for use as markers of black tea intake. In an initial study, nine compounds, assessed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found to increase in concentration in urine after 3 cups of black tea over 3 h. A subsequent study employed a controlled crossover design in which 10 subjects consumed 5 cups per day of black tea or water for 4 weeks in random order. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected at the end of each period. Of the 9 candidate compounds identified in the initial study, only 3 were present at higher concentrations in urine of all 10 subjects during tea-drinking in comparison to water-drinking periods. These compounds were identified as 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and 3, 4-O-dimethylgallic acid, all methyl ether derivatives of gallic acid. It is suggested that these compounds have the potential to be used as markers of black tea intake.",1
"Influence of two fertilization regimens on the amounts of organic acids and phenolic compounds of tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC) A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, two isomeric forms of 1,2-disinapoylgentiobiose, 1-sinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In general, internal leaves exhibited more constant chemical profiles.",1
"Changes in the phytochemical composition and profile of raw, boiled, and roasted peanuts Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not observed in the raw peanut extracts.",0

"Superoxide radical scavenging activity of the major polyphenols in fresh plums The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) = 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums. However, they showed relatively low contribution to the total SRSA.",0

"Polyphenolic content in five Tuscany cultivars of Olea europaea L In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.",1
"Literature data may underestimate the actual antioxidant capacity of cereals Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.",0
"Quantification of genistein and genistin in soybeans and soybean products It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate cancers are greater than the Japanese.",1

"Changes in polyphenolic content and radical-scavenging activity of sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) during storage at optimal and low temperatures Polyphenolic content and radical-scavenging activities (RSA) of four sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivars were characterized after storage at optimal (15 degrees C) or low temperature (5 degrees C) for 0, 13, 26, and 37 days. The polyphenolic content increased during storage in three cultivars but not in 'Murasakimasari'. The change in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) correlated very well with polyphenolic content. The increases in polyphenolics and the RSA in 'Benimasari' were significantly greater during storage at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. The main polyphenolic components in all cultivars were chlorogenic acid (ChA) and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA). ChA level increased more at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, whereas that of 3,5-diCQA was greater at 15 degrees C. Caffeoylquinic acids and RSA in 'Murasakimasari', which contains a large amount of anthocyanin in flesh tissue, were extremely high at the beginning of storage and remained nearly constant or decreased over time. A non-caffeoylquinic acid component that increased during storage, especially in 'J-Red' at 15 degrees C, was purified by successive chromatographic steps. The isolate was identified as caffeoyl sucrose [CSu, 6-O-caffeoyl-(beta- d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1))-alpha-D-glucopyranoside] by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). These results suggest that storage under cultivar-dependent, controlled temperature is one approach for increasing desirable physiologic function associated with RSA of polyphenolic compounds in sweet potato roots.",1

"Identification by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analyses and quantification of constituents of fennel teas and decoctions Qualitative and quantitative differences among the constituents in various fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., family Apiaceae) teas prepared by classical infusion, microwave decoction, and dissolution are reported. Different commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were found in two teas. Quality, activity, and safety of the content of the investigated preparations are also discussed.",0

"Ferulic acid release and 4-vinylguaiacol formation during brewing and ferrmentation: indications for feruloyl estrease activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae The release of ferulic acid and the subsequent thermal or enzymatic decarboxylation to 4-vinylguaiacol are inherent to the beer production process. Phenolic, medicinal, or clove-like flavors originating from 4-vinylguaiacol frequently occur in beer made with wheat or wheat malt. To evaluate the release of ferulic acid and the transformation to 4-vinylguaiacol, beer was brewed with different proportions of barley malt, wheat, and wheat malt. Ferulic acid as well as 4-vinylguaiacol levels were determined by HPLC at several stages of the beer production process. During brewing, ferulic acid was released at the initial mashing phase, whereas moderate levels of 4-vinylguaiacol were formed by wort boiling. Higher levels of the phenolic flavor compound were produced during fermentations with brewery yeast strains of the Pof(+) phenotype. In beer made with barley malt, ferulic acid was mainly released during the brewing process. Conversely, 60-90% of ferulic acid in wheat or wheat malt beer was hydrolyzed during fermentation, causing higher 4-vinylguaiacol levels in these beers. As cereal enzymes are most likely inactivated during wort boiling, the additional release of ferulic acid during fermentation suggests the activity of feruloyl esterases produced by brewer's yeast.",1

"Effect of freezing and storage on the phenolics, ellagitannins, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity of red raspberries Scottish-grown red raspberries are a rich source of vitamin C and phenolics, most notably, the anthocyanins cyanidin-3-sophoroside, cyanidin-3-(2(G)-glucosylrutinoside), and cyanidin-3-glucoside, and two ellagitannins, sanguiin H-6 and lambertianin C, which are present together with trace levels of flavonols, ellagic acid, and hydroxycinnamates. The antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per serving.",1
"Determination of Stilbenes (-viniferin, trans-astringin, trans-piceid, cis- and trans-resveratrol, -viniferin) in Brazilian Wines Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.",1
"Olive oils rich in natural catecholic phenols decrease isoprostane excretion in humans This study was undertaken to evaluate, in humans, the antioxidant activity of olive oil phenolics, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone that share an orthodiphenolic (catecholic) structure. Human volunteers were administered olive oil samples containing increasing amounts of an olive oil phenolic extract that was characterized by gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry. The administration of phenol-rich oils was dose-dependently associated with a decreased urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), a biomarker of oxidative stress. Also, a statistically significant negative correlation between homovanillyl alcohol (HValc, hydroxytyrosol's major metabolite, formed through the COMT system) and F(2)-isoprostanes excretion was found. Thus, the administration of oil samples with increasing, albeit low, concentrations of orthodiphenolic compounds, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone, results in a dose-dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha). The statistically significant negative correlation between 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and HValc urinary concentrations suggests that this metabolite better reflects the in vivo activities of hydroxytyrosol.",0
"Anthocyanins, phenolics, and antioxidant capacity in diverse small fruits: vaccinium, rubus, and ribes Fruits from 107 genotypes of Vaccinium L., Rubus L., and Ribes L., were analyzed for total anthocyanins (ACY), total phenolics (TPH), and antioxidant capacities as determined by oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.",1

"Total phenolic content and antioxidant properties of eclipse black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) as affected by processing methods The effects of soaking, boiling, and steaming processes on the phenolic components and antioxidant activity of black beans were investigated. All processed beans exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower antioxidant activities than raw beans in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). Steaming processes resulted in a greater retention of TPC and ORAC values than the boiling processes. Pressure boiling shortened processing time compared to regular boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, but significantly increased in ORAC as compared to the regular boiling method. Pressure steaming resulted in significant decreases in TPC, DPPH, while significantly increased in ORAC compared to regular steaming. Greater TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values were detected in boiling water than in the soaking and steaming water. Mass balance analysis showed that boiling caused more dry solid loss than steaming. All of these results indicated that processing methods significantly changed contents and activities of antioxidant components of black beans. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in appearance and texture of the cooked product, shortening processing time, and in greater retention of TPC and antioxidant activities. Steam processing may be used to develop high-quality health-promoting black bean products.",1
"Phenolics and betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta vulgaris) root: distribution and effect of cold storage on the content of total phenolics and three individual compounds The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and the main known ferulic acid ester (beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.",0

"Polyphenols from alcoholic apple cider are absorbed, metabolized and excreted by humans We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) (maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin = 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.",1
"Avenanthramides in oats (Avena sativa) and structure-antioxidant activity relationships Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and chlorobenzene, respectively.",0

"Quercetin glucuronides but not glucosides are present in human plasma after consumption of quercetin-3-glucoside or quercetin-4'-glucoside The nature of quercetin conjugates present in blood after consumption of quercetin glucosides is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed plasma of volunteers that had consumed 325 micromol of either quercetin-3-glucoside or quercetin-4'-glucoside as an oral solution. Quercetin metabolites were extracted with acetonitrile/phosphoric acid and these extracts were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography with Coularray detection that distinguishes between the glucuronidated and the glucosylated forms of quercetin. No intact quercetin glucosides and only trace amounts of aglycone were found in human plasma, irrespective of the glucoside ingested. This was confirmed by spiking the plasma with glucoside standards. The major components in plasma had the same retention time as quercetin glucuronide standards. These plasma components disappeared after treatment of the plasma with bovine liver beta-glucuronidase, under reformation of quercetin, and showed the same oxidation pattern as the glucuronides. These results suggest that after consumption of quercetin glucosides, quercetin glucuronides are major metabolites in plasma.",1

"Elevated circulating LDL phenol levels in men who consumed virgin rather than refined olive oil are associated with less oxidation of plasma LDL In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null (0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = -0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.",1

"Chlorogenic acid bioavailability largely depends on its metabolism by the gut microflora in rats Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites (ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.",1
"Biotransformation of genistein in the rat: elucidation of metabolite structure by product ion mass fragmentology Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.",1
"Bioavailablility of elderberry anthocyanins Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.",1

"Protocatechuic acid is the major human metabolite of cyanidin-glucosides The metabolic fate of dietary anthocyanins (ACN) has not been fully clarified in humans. In all previous studies, the proportion of total ACN absorbed and excreted in urine was <1% intake. This study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of cyanidin-glucosides (CyG) contained in blood orange juice (BOJ). One liter of BOJ, containing 71 mg CyG, was consumed by 6 healthy, fasting volunteers. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at baseline and at different times up to 24 h after juice consumption. The content of native CyG, glucuronidated/methylated derivatives, and various phenolic acids was determined by HPLC/MS/MS. The serum maximal concentration of cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc) was 1.9 +/- 0.6 nmol/L and that of protocatechuic acid (PCA) was 492 +/- 62 nmol/L at 0.5 h and 2 h after juice consumption, respectively. The calculated total amounts in plasma corresponded for Cy-3-glc to 0.02% and for PCA to 44% of CyG ingested. CyG and glucuronidated/methylated metabolites, but not PCA, were detected in urine. ACN recovered in 24-h urine collections represented approximately 1.2% of the ingested dose. Both CyG (1.90 +/- 0.04 nmol/g) and PCA (277 +/- 0.2 nmol/g) were recovered in 24-h fecal samples. Data explained the metabolic fate of 74% of BOJ ACN. PCA was for the first time, to our knowledge, identified in humans as a CyG metabolite, accounting for almost 73% of ingested CyG. A high concentration of PCA may explain the short-term increased plasma antioxidant activity observed after intake of cyanidin-rich food and it can also contribute to the numerous health benefits attributed to dietary ACN consumption.",1

"Flavonoid quantification in onion by spectrophotometric and high performance liquid chromatography analysis Direct spectrophotometric determination of quercetin content in onions (Allium cepa L.) was investigated as a possible alternative to high-performance liquid chroma- tography (HPLC) analysis. Quercetin content in five onion varieties was monitored at 362 nm and quantified using simple spectrophotometric and HPLC methods. HPLC revealed that 3,4'-Qdg and 4'-Qmg comprised up to 93% of total flavonol content detected in the studied varieties. These major quercetin conjugates combined (3,4'-Qdg + 4'-Qmg) and total flavonol conjugates quantified by HPLC correlated closely with spectrophotometer values. Correlation coefficients were 0.96 (P < 0.0001) for 3,4'-Qdg + 4'-Qmg and 0.97 (P < 0.0001) for total flavonol conjugates in onion. Simple spectropho- tometric procedure proved to be a valid, efficient, and cost-effective method for the quantification of total quercetin in onion. Chemical names used: quercetin-3,4'-O- diglucoside (3,4'-Qdg); quercetin-4'-O-glucoside (4'-Qmg).",0
"A liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QTOF)-based metabolomic approach reveals new metabolic effects of catechin in rats fed high-fat diets Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.",1
"Total phenol, catechin, and caffeine contents of teas commonly consumed in the United Kingdom Levels of total phenol, catechins, and caffeine in teas commonly consumed in the United Kingdom have been determined using reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect in various population groups.",1
"Lignan contents of Dutch plant foods: a database including lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan precursors, but now several new precursors have been identified, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database including all four major enterolignan precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-three solid foods and twenty-six beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans was flaxseed (301,129 microg/100 g), which contained mainly secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29,331 microg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg/100 g. However, many vegetables and fruits had similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of lignans (185-2321 microg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91 microg/100 ml (red wine). Only four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol. Thus, available databases largely underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods.",0
"Cultural system affects fruit quality and antioxidant capacity in strawberries Cultural system [hill plasticulture (HC) versus matted row (MR)] and genotype interactions affected strawberry fruit quality. In general, fruit soluble solids content, total sugar, fructose, glucose, ascorbic acid, titratable acid, and citric acid contents were increased in the HC system. Fruit from HC also had higher flavonoid contents and antioxidant capacities. Strawberry fruit contains flavonols as well as other phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins and phenolic acids. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate were the predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit. The content of cyanidin-based anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins in either system. Strawberry fruit from the HC system had significantly higher amounts of p-coumaroylglucose, dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate. Fruits from plants grown in the MR system generally had the lowest contents of phenolic acids, flavonols, and anthocyanins. Strawberry fruit grown under HC conditions had significantly higher peroxyl radicals (ROO*) absorbance capacity (ORAC).",1

"Compositional changes induced by UV-B radiation treatment of common bean and soybean seedlings monitored by capillary electrophoresis with diode array detection In this work, a new CE method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for the monitoring and quantitation of flavonoids in different beans treated and untreated with UV-B radiation. Flavonoid concentration was monitored in UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively. The proposed method shows (i) the potentialities of bean sprouts as a natural source of bioactive compounds (antioxidants); (ii) the technological role of UV-B treatment for sprout isoflavone enrichment; and (iii) the good capabilities of CE-DAD to monitor this process.",0

"Analysis of phenolic compounds in the evaluation of commercial quince jam authenticity The phenolic compounds present in 17 samples of Portuguese commercial and three homemade quince jams were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, to determine their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the complete definition of quince jams profiles, one of them including an Amberlite XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all the samples presented a similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds, several unidentified characteristic procyanidin polymers, and sodium benzoate as preservative of quince jams. Several samples also contained arbutin, suggesting that these quince jam samples were fraudulently adulterated with pear puree.",0
"Determination of isoflavones in soy and selected foods containing soy by extraction, saponification, and liquid chromatography: Collaborative study Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone values of 47-3099 microg/g.",1
"Frozen storage effects on anthocyanins and volatile compounds of raspberry fruit The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place during processing and the storage period.",1
"Rapid and complete extraction of phenols from olive oil and determination by means of a coulometric electrode array system Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.",1
"Evaluation of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil by direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon (3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.",0

Common bean effects on health have been related to its dietary fiber content and other active compounds. This study assessed the content of flavonoids, coumestrol, phenolic acids, galactooligosaccharides, and phytic acid in wild and cultivated Mexican common bean seeds (raw and cooked) and that of flavonoids, coumestrol, and phenolic acids in germinated bean seeds. The presence of isoflavones in raw bean seeds was not confirmed by the UV spectra. Quercetin, kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.",0
"Phytochemicals and antioxidant activity of milled fractions of different wheat varieties The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher (p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions (1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was >80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.",1

The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit time.",1
"Catechin and epicatechin concentrations of red wines: regional and cultivar-related differences Employing gradient elution HPLC with direct injection of 20 µL of sample and diode array detection, the (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin concentrations were determined in >800 red wines from different wine-producing regions. The concentrations of both were highest in wines vinted from Pinot noir in all regions where this cultivar is grown, with red Burgundy and Canadian wines having the highest concentrations. Among wines vinted exclusively or predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, the highest catechin concentrations were found in wines from Washington State and Bordeaux (Medoc) with highest values for epicatechin in wines from Bordeaux and Canada. Next to wines from Pinot noir, those from Merlot had the highest in concentrations and wines from Shiraz the lowest. The ratio catechin: epicatechin showed considerable variation among the different cultivars, highest values for this ratio being found in wines from Pinot Noir and lowest in wines from Shiraz. Regression analysis revealed a variable but significant relationship between the two compounds, with the correlation coefficient ranging between 0.460 (Rhone Valley) to 0.917 (Oregon Pinot noir). Their relationship demonstrated a significant independent component, probably a consequence of genetic factors determining their concentrations in individual cultivars. However, their distribution is reminiscent of the pattern shown by resveratrol free isomers, suggesting that, in addition to cultivar, fungal pressure and climatic stress may promote their synthesis by Vitis vinifera .",0

Total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibers, total phenols, epicatechin, gallic and p-coumaric acids, and concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.",0
"Antioxidant activity in fruits and leaves of blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry varies with cultivar and developmental stage Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves (205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, and red raspberries.",1

"Aglycones and sugar moieties alter anthocyanin absorption and metabolism after berry consumption in weanling pigs To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight (BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and metabolism of ACNs.",0
"Isolation and identification of urinary metabolites of kakkalide in rats Kakkalide is a major isoflavonoid from the flowers of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, possessing the protective effect against ethanol-induced intoxication and hepatic injury. The metabolism of kakkalide was investigated in rats. Thirteen metabolites were isolated by using solvent extraction and repeated chromatographic methods and identified by using spectroscopic methods including UV, IR, mass spectrometry, NMR, and circular dichroism experiments. Four new compounds were identified as irisolidone-7-O-glucuronide (M-1), tectorigenin-7-O-sulfate (M-2), tectorigenin-4'-O-sulfate (M-3), and biochanin A-6-O-sulfate (M-4) together with nine known compounds identified as irisolidone (M-5), tectorigenin (M-6), tectoridin (M-7), 5,7-dihydroxy-8,4'-dimethoxyisoflavone (M-8), isotectorigenin (M-9), biochanin A (M-10), genistein (M-11), daidzein (M-12), and equol (M-13). The metabolic pathway of kakkalide was proposed, which is important to understand its metabolic fate and disposition in humans.",0
"Bioavailability of ellagic acid in human plasma after consumption of ellagitannins from pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) juice Ellagic acid (EA) and hydrolyzable ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols found in fruits and nuts and implicated with potent antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherosclerotic biological properties. Unfortunately, there are no reports on the bioavailability studies of EA or ETs in the human body. We conducted in vivo studies whereby a human subject consumed pomegranate juice (PJ) (180 ml) containing EA (25 mg) and ETs (318 mg, as punicalagins, the major fruit ellagitannin).",1

"Identification of metabolites in human plasma and urine after consumption of a polyphenol-rich juice drink A polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was developed as a potential approach to increase intake of dietary polyphenols. Analysis of the beverage by HPLC with PDA, fluorescence, and MS detection facilitated the identification/partial identification of 40 flavonoids and related phenolic compounds. The main constituents were (-)-epigallocatechin and other green tea flavan-3-ols, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside, gallic acid, hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and procyanidins, with trace levels of several flavonols and purple grape juice anthocyanins also being present. Healthy human subjects (n = 10) consumed 350 mL of the P-R juice drink, after which plasma and urine samples were collected over a 0-24 h period. HPLC-MS analysis identified 13 metabolites in plasma and a further 20 in urine. Qualitatively, the profiles of the glucuronide, sulfated, and methylated metabolites were very similar to those detected in earlier investigations when the main components in the juice drink were consumed separately in feeding studies with coffee, green tea, orange juice, and apple cider.",0
"Content of the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 25 edible berries The amounts of quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol aglycons in 25 edible berries were analyzed by an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV detection and identified with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry detection. Sixteen species of cultivated berries and nine species of wild berries were collected in Finland in 1997. Quercetin was found in all berries, the contents being highest in bog whortleberry (158 mg/kg, fresh weight), lingonberry (74 and 146 mg/kg), cranberry (83 and 121 mg/kg), chokeberry (89 mg/kg), sweet rowan (85 mg/kg), rowanberry (63 mg/kg), sea buckthorn berry (62 mg/kg), and crowberry (53 and 56 mg/kg). Amounts between 14 and 142 mg/kg of myricetin were detected in cranberry, black currant, crowberry, bog whortleberry, blueberries, and bilberry. Kaempferol was detected only in gooseberries (16 and 19 mg/kg) and strawberries (5 and 8 mg/kg). Total contents of these flavonols (100-263 mg/kg) in cranberry, bog whortleberry, lingonberry, black currant, and crowberry were higher than those in the commonly consumed fruits or vegetables, except for onion, kale, and broccoli.",1
"Resveratrol glucosides are important components of commercial wines Using a direct-injection HPLC method with isocratic elution and UV detection, the isomers of free resveratrol and their glucosides (polydatin) have been assayed in nearly 700 commercial red wines from most of the world9s areas of production. The highest concentrations of polydatin were found in wines from the Midi and Rhone Valley of France, Canada, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and South America. In the last three regions, the polydatin concentrations exceeded those of free resveratrol which were the lowest of all categories examined, suggesting that the high sugar content of warm climate grapes may favor the glycosylation of resveratrol. In nine regions, the concentration of cis -polydatin exceeded that of trans -polydatin, the reverse being the case in five, yet in all trans -resveratrol concentrations exceeded those of cis -resveratrol. There was only a weak negative correlation overall between polydatin and resveratrol concentrations when all wines were included in the analysis. The low values for both polydatin and resveratrol in Californian wines are consistent with the notion that, despite high sugar content, some grapes may fail to express resveratrol synthetic enzymes due to genetic characteristics or to lack of environmental stress, and consequently little of the free resveratrol is available for glycosylation. The influence of cultivar was examined in wines from several regions. Among wines from California, Australia, South America and Canada, highest polydatin concentrations were found respectively in those from Zinfandel, Shiraz, Merlot and Pinot noir. Wines from the Northern Rhone Valley (predominantly Shiraz) had lower concentrations than those from the Southern Rhone where Mourvedre, Grenache, Carignane and Cinsault predominate. The high polydatin and very low resveratrol concentrations of Vintage Ports highlight enological techniques, particularly duration of fermentation, as important modulating factors. The concentrations of polydatin present in most red wines are likely to add significantly to the presumed health benefits attributable to resveratrol.",0
"Effects of food processing on flavonoids and lycopene status in a Mediterranean tomato variety This research is focused on the antioxidant properties of dietary components, in particular phenolics and carotenoids and the assessment of the contribution of the combined antioxidants to the total antioxidant activity (TAA) of tomato fruit. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of processing on the antioxidant properties of tomato. The effects of three different methods of processing fresh tomatoes into tomato sauce were investigated with respect to the antioxidant properties of the fruit. Identification and quantification of the main carotenoids and flavonoids present in tomatoes was achieved by HPLC analysis and the effect on the concentration and availability of these compounds was investigated at different stages of the processing. The processing affected mainly naringenin causing a reduction in the concentration. Conversely, levels of chlorogenic acid were increased suggesting an improvement in availability of this compound to extraction. The concentration of all-trans-lycopene was also increased following processing. Less than 10% isomerisation of all-trans-lycopene to the cis form was detected for all the methods analysed. The effects of processing on the overall antioxidant activity support the theory of a general improvement in availability of individual antioxidants. For both hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts TAA values were increased.",1
"Quantification of the predominant monomeric catechins in baking chocolate standard reference material by LC/APCI-MS Catechins are polyphenolic plant compounds (flavonoids) that may offer significant health benefits to humans. These benefits stem largely from their anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and antimutagenic properties. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of flavonoid-containing foods is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Chocolate is a natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material. This is the first reported use of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry for the quantitative determination of monomeric catechins in chocolate and the only report certifying monomeric catechin levels in a food-based Standard Reference Material.",1
"Chocolate intake increases urinary excretion of polyphenol-derived phenolic acids in healthy human subjects Proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in chocolate, are not depolymerized in the stomach and reach the small intestine intact, where they are hardly absorbed because of their high molecular weight. In vitro and in vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.",0
"A urinary profile study of dietary phytoestrogens. The identification and mode of metabolism of new isoflavonoids The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with soya.",1
"Urinary excretion of the main anthocyanin in lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, and its metabolites In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries ( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in several studies.",1

"Urinary excretion of anthocyanins in humans after cranberry juice ingestion Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.",0

"Detection and quantification of glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seed by LC-DAD-ESI/MS A screening method using LC-DAD-ESI/MS was applied to the analysis of flavonoids in celery, Chinese celery, and celery seeds (Apium graveolens L. and varieties). Fifteen flavonoid glycosides were detected in the three celery materials. They were identified as luteolin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-apiosylglucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-glucoside, and more than 10 malonyl derivatives of these glycosides. The identification of the malonyl derivatives was confirmed by their conversion into glycosides upon heating and by comparison of some of the malonates with malonates that had previously been identified in red bell pepper and parsley. The concentrations of the glycosides and the malonyl glycosides in the three materials were estimated by comparison to aglycone standards. This is the first report of the presence of these glycosylated flavonoid malonates in celery.",1
"Effect of Various Compounds on Virgin Olive Oil Stability Measured by Rancimat Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.",1
"From plums to prunes: influence of drying parameters on polyphenols and antioxidant activity Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 degrees C until 50% of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 degrees C; (ii) air temperature at 60 degrees C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed plums.",1
"The metabolism of ellagic acid in the rat 1. Following oral administration of ellagic acid to the rat, 10% of the dose was excreted as 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one in urine and faeces. A second metabolite was detected in urine and faeces but not identified. Both metabolites were of microfloral origin, as their formation was not observed in germ-free rats but was demonstrated when ellagic acid was incubated in vitro with micro-organisms from rat gastro-intestinal tract. 2. Following intraperitoneal, but not oral, administration of ellagic acid, a third metabolite was detected in urine. 3. Unchanged ellagic acid was not detected in faeces or urine of any normal rat examined, but small amounts were detected in the faeces of germ-free animals. 4. Following oral administration of ellagic acid, two conjugates of 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one were detected in bile, whereas intraperitoneal administration resulted in the biliary excretion of three conjugates of an unidentified metabolite.",1

"Determination of unusual soya and non-soya phytoestrogen sources in beer, fish products and other foods Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices (30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.",0

"Aspalathin, a flavonoid in Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), is absorbed by pig intestine as a C-glycoside Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos extracts.",1
"Separation of flavanone-7-O-glycoside diastereomers and analysis in citrus juices by multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial sources.",1
"Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of oleuropein and its metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma and urine after oral administration We describe a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the secoiridoid oleuropein and its bioactive metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma and urine. Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly found as glucuronides.",1
"Targeted metabolic profiling of phenolics in urine and plasma after regular consumption of cocoa by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.",0

"Effect of milk on the urinary excretion of microbial phenolic acids after cocoa powder consumption in humans Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.",1
"Content of the flavonols myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol in Finnish berry wines The amounts of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were analyzed in 16 red and 2 white berry and grape wines after acid hydrolysis using an RP-HPLC method with diode array detection. The red berry wines analyzed were made mainly from black currant, crowberry, and bog whortleberry, i.e., berries rich in flavonols. The red grape wines were made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot grapes in several countries. The white wines studied were gooseberry and white currant wines and Chardonnay and Riesling wines. The amount of myricetin ranged from 3.8 to 22.6 mg L(-1) in red berry wines and from 0 to 14.6 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. The amount of quercetin was from 2.2 to 24.3 mg L(-1) red berry wines and from <1.2 to 19.4 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. Low levels of kaempferol were found in all red berry wines and in 9 red grape wines. The total concentration of these flavonols was from 6 to 46 mg L(-1) (mean 20 mg L(-1)) in red berry wines and from 4 to 31 mg L(-1) (mean 15 mg L(-1)) in red grape wines. Small amounts of quercetin were found in white currant and gooseberry wines, whereas no flavonols were detected in white grape wines. These results demonstrate that the contents of flavonols in red",1
"Flavonoids detection by HPLC-DAD-MS-MS in lemon juices from Sicilian cultivars High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and spectral data and literature references both suggested a 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to be readily differentiated.",1
"Quantification of flavonoid constituents in Citrus fruits Twenty-four flavonoids have been determined in 66 Citrus species and near-citrus relatives, grown in the same field and year, by means of reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Statistical methods have been applied to find relations among the species. The F ratios of 21 flavonoids obtained by applying ANOVA analysis are significant, indicating that a classification of the species using these variables is reasonable to pursue. Principal component analysis revealed that the distributions of Citrus species belonging to different classes were largely in accordance with Tanaka's classification system.",1
"Antioxidant capacity of oat (Avena sativa L.) extracts. 2. In vitro antioxidant activity and contents of phenolic and tocol antioxidants Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the groat, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.",1

"Influence of storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation in potato tubers (Solanum tuburosum L.) The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.",0

"The pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered as SE5-OH tablets to healthy postmenopausal women The soy isoflavone metabolite, S-(-)equol, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor (ER)beta and also antagonizes in vivo the action of dihydrotestosterone. It is therefore of interest as a potential new therapeutic agent in hormone-dependent conditions and is under development as a nutraceutical. Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Three participants were determined to be equol-producers, representing a 25% frequency, and equol-producer status had no effect on natural S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics.",1
"Varietal differences in phenolic content and antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of onions Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.",1
"Pharmacokinetics of soybean isoflavones in plasma, urine and feces of men after ingestion of 60 g baked soybean powder (kinako) To take advantage of the various pharmacologic activities of soy bean isoflavones, more detailed studies of the absorption and excretion rates of these compounds in humans and subsequent evaluation of their bioavailabilities are required. We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have biological effects.",1
Processing of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sorghum products alters procyanidin oligomer and polymer distribution and content Sorghum procyanidins were characterized and quantified from two brown sorghum varieties and their processed products by normal phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The DP of the procyanidins was determined by thiolysis. Quantification was done by using purified oligomeric and polymeric cocoa procyanidins as external standards. Sorghum procyanidins were composed mostly of high MW (DP > 10) polymers. Significant differences were observed in levels as well as distribution of the different MW procyanidins between the sorghums. Processing of the sorghum brans into cookies and bread significantly reduced the levels of procyanidins; this effect was more pronounced in the higher MW polymers. Cookies had a higher retention of procyanidins (42-84%) than bread (13-69%). Extrusion of sorghum grain resulted in an increase in the levels of procyanidin oligomers with DP </= 4 and decrease in polymers with DP >/= 6. This suggests a possible breakdown of the high MW polymers to the lower MW constituents during extrusion. Processing changes not only the content of procyanidins in sorghum products but also the relative ratio of the different molecular weights.,1

"Sterol ferulates, sterols, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinols from wheat, rye, and corn bran oils and their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus activation Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate (5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol (10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol (19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- (14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters.

"Chemometric studies of vinegars from different raw materials and processes of production The phenolic composition, aroma compounds, and organic acid content of 83 vinegars have been determined. Multivariate analysis techniques have been used to classify these vinegar samples according to raw material (white wine, red wine, apple, honey, alcohol, balsamic, and malt) and production process (with and without aging in wood). Cluster analysis grouped the samples according to production process. Only apple and balsamic vinegars were separated from wine vinegars. Alcohol, honey, and malt vinegars were grouped with no aged wine vinegars. Linear discriminate analysis allowed a 88% differentiation according to raw material and 100% according to aging in wood. Besides, from the results obtained, a major role of the volatile compounds in the differentiation of the vinegar samples according to their aging period in wood can be seen.",1
"Yoghurt impacts on the excretion of phenolic acids derived from colonic breakdown of orange juice flavanones in humans Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of (i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic microbiota.",0
"Stability of Cocoa Antioxidants and Flavan-3-ols over Time Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and flavan-3-ol content.",0

"Extraction and quantification of lignan phytoestrogens in food and human samples Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, identified in urine are presented.",0
"Phenolic acid metabolites as biomarkers for tea- and coffee-derived polyphenol exposure in human subjects Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. Many of the demonstrated activities are consistent with favourable effects on the risk of chronic diseases. 4-O-methylgallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid are potential biomarkers of exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid is derived from chlorogenic acid in coffee. Our major objective was to explore the relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid in human subjects. The relationships of long-term usual (111 participants) and contemporaneously recorded current (344 participants) tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid were assessed in two populations. 4OMGA was related to usual (r 0.50, P<0.001) and current (r 0.57, P<0.001) tea intake, and isoferulic acid was related to usual (r 0.26, P=0.008) and current (r 0.18, P<0.001) coffee intake. Overall, our present results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker for black tea-derived polyphenol exposure, but isoferulic acid may be of limited usefulness as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.",1

"Identification of isomeric flavonoid glucuronides in urine and plasma by metal complexation and LC-ESI-MS/MS Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.",0
"Determination of lignans and isoflavonoids in human female plasma following dietary supplementation Plasma levels of the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone, and also the isoflavonic phyto-oestrogens daidzein, equol and genistein, are reported for postmenopausal Australian women consuming a traditional diet supplemented with linseed, soya flour or clover sprouts. Analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, after enzymatic hydrolysis and ion-exchange chromatography. Following linseed supplementation, combined levels of enterolactone and enterodiol reached 500 ng/ml, whereas after soya flour or clover sprouts the respective concentrations of equol, daidzein and genistein reached 43, 312 and 148 ng/ml. Not all subjects were able to produce equol from daidzein. The possible relationship and role of these weak dietary oestrogens as restraining factors in the development of hormone-dependent cancers in Asian populations is discussed.",0

"Soy consumption alters endogenous estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women Isoflavones are soy phytoestrogens that have been suggested to be anticarcinogenic. Our previous study in premenopausal women suggested that the mechanisms by which isoflavones exert cancer-preventive effects may involve modulation of estrogen metabolism away from production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites [16alpha-(OH) estrone, 4-(OH) estrone, and 4-(OH) estradiol] (X. Xu et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 7: 1101-1108, 1998). To further evaluate this hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone feeding study was performed in 18 healthy postmenopausal women. The study consisted of three diet periods, each separated by a washout of approximately 3 weeks. Each diet period lasted for 93 days, during which subjects consumed their habitual diets supplemented with soy protein isolate providing 0.1 (control), 1, or 2 mg isoflavones/kg body weight/day (7.1 +/- 1.1, 65 +/- 11, or 132 +/- 22 mg/day). A 72-h urine sample was collected 3 days before the study (baseline) and days 91-93 of each diet period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Compared with the soy-free baseline and very low isoflavone control diet, consumption of 65 mg isoflavones increased the urinary 2/16alpha-(OH) estrone ratio, and consumption of 65 or 132 mg isoflavones decreased excretion of 4-(OH) estrone. When compared with baseline values, consumption of all three soy diets increased the ratio of 2/4-(OH) estrogens and decreased the ratio of genotoxic: total estrogens. These data suggest that both isoflavones and other soy constituents may exert cancer-preventive effects in postmenopausal women by altering estrogen metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.",1

"Metabolic analysis of four phenolic acids in rat by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry A liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS(n)) method was established for the analysis of danshensu, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid in rat plasma, bile, urine and feces after oral administration or intravenous injection. Liquid-liquid extraction was employed for the preparation of biosamples, and the chromatographic separation was carried out using an Agilent Zorbax Extend C(18) reversed phase column and acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. Totally nineteen metabolites were detected and identified as prototype, methylated, hydroxylated, sulfated and glucuronized conjugates. The metabolism of the individual phenolic acids in biosamples was investigated, and the metabolic pathway was proposed. By comparing the metabolism of different compounds which shared similar structures, we were able to find that methylation was the main pathway of danshensu metabolism, and the double bond on the side chain was critical for the drug excretion via bile and the formation of glucuronized conjugates. The results proved that the established method was simple, sensitive and reliable, which could be used to detect and identify the structures of metabolites and to better understand their in vivo metabolism.",1
"Anthocyanins exist in the circulation primarily as metabolites in adult men Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 (nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 (nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.",0
"Influence of jam processing on the radical scavenging activity and phenolic content in berries Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for all of the berry types.",1

"Optimisation of gradient HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds and favonoids in beer using a CoulArray detector A method was developed for simultaneous analysis of natural antioxidants in beer using multichannel electrochemical detection with a CoulArray detector, which enables selective and sensitive antioxidant detection in gradient HPLC and facilitates the identification of analytes based on the ratios of signals recorded at different potentials applied to the detection cells arranged in series. The separation conditions were optimised for 27 phenolic compounds including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides identified in beer samples. Separation selectivities of 11 columns with different stationary phase chemistries were compared, and the pH and gradient programs were optimised for the individual columns to provide best resolution and high number of resolved peaks, using the window-diagram approach. The effects of pH on the sensitivity of electrochemical coulometric detection were considered in the optimisation approach. The optimised conditions were applied to the analysis of real beer samples.",1
"Presence of virgin olive oil phenolic metabolites in human low density lipoprotein fraction: determination by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry The biological benefits of olive oil in preventing the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) would seem to be linked to its high monounsaturated fatty acid contents, but also to its respective phenolic compounds contents. One prerequisite to assess the in vivo physiological significance of phenolic compounds is to determine their presence in human LDL following the ingestion of virgin olive oil. In this work, olive oil phenolic metabolites were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) detection, after solid phase extraction (SPE). Quantitative methods were developed in carrying out linearity, precision, sensitivity and recovery tests. The results from two methods of LDL separation were compared and shorter LDL isolation procedure showed a better recovery for antioxidants compounds in LDL. The metabolites identified in LDL were: hydroxytyrosol monoglucuronide, hydroxytyrosol monosulfate, tyrosol glucuronide, tyrosol sulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate. The fact that olive oil phenolic metabolites are able to bind LDL strengthens claims that these compounds act as in vivo antioxidants.",1
"Extraction and quantification of lignan phytoestrogens in food and human samples Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, identified in urine are presented.",1
"Anthocyanin absorption, metabolism, and distribution from a wild blueberry-enriched diet (Vaccinium angustifolium) is affected by diet duration in the Sprague-Dawley rat The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) (WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the present experimental conditions.",1
"Stability of Cocoa Antioxidants and Flavan-3-ols over Time Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and flavan-3-ol content.",1

"Characterization of major anthocyanins and the color of red-fleshed budd blood orange (Citrus sinensis) High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood (Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside (33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.",1
"Absorption, conjugation and excretion of the flavanones, naringenin and hesperetin from alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice in human subjects We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in dose.",0
"Novel approach to the detection and quantification of phenolic compounds in olive oil based on 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 31P NMR spectroscopy has been employed to detect and quantify phenolic compounds in the polar fraction of virgin olive oil. This novel analytical method is based on the derivatization of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of phenolic compounds with 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyldioxaphospholane and the identification of the phosphitylated compounds on the basis of the 31P chemical shifts. Quantification of a large number of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil can be accomplished by integration of the appropriate signals in the 31P NMR spectrum and the use of the phosphitylated cyclohexanol as internal standard. Finally, the validity of this technique for quantitative measurements was thoroughly examined.",0

"Mangiferin and hesperidin metabolites are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of pigs after oral ingestion of a Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush tea) extract Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin (norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in vivo.",1
"Urinary excretion of strawberry anthocyanins is dose dependent for physiological oral doses of fresh fruit There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion (Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.",1
"Antioxidant Capacities and Phenolics Levels of French Wines from Different Varieties and Vintages Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins [(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.",1

"Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil Antioxidant activity of the phenolic fraction of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was measured by means of a chemical and an electrochemical method. Both methods were tested in predicting the oxidative spoilage and stability to oxidation of 22 EVOO samples and resulted correlated with peroxide values and oxidative stability measured by Rancimat. The main phenolic compounds of EVOOs were detected by HRGC. To study the contribution of single polyphenols (PPs) to antioxidant activity of phenolic fraction and oxidative stability of EVOOs, multivariate statistical analyses were applied on HRGC data. An isomer of oleuropein aglycon was shown to affect significantly antioxidant activity of phenolic fraction but not oil stability to oxidation. No individual compounds was identified as the main cause of the overall antioxidant activity, and the total polyphenol determination by the Folin reagent was better correlated to antioxidant activity and oxidative stability than each tested PP or PPs groups such as o-diphenols.",1
"Nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) undergoing different cooking methods and germination The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and restaurants.",1
"Comparison of the main bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities in garlic and white and red onions after treatment protocols Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in garlic than in onions. Quercetin quantity was the highest in red onion among the studied vegetables. The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 to 112 kDa.",1

"Low-density lipoprotein antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds and polyphenol oxidase activity in selected clingstone peach cultivars The antioxidant potential of eight clingstone peach cultivars was investigated by determining phenolic compounds and inhibition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. Cultivars low in polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were also selected to minimize enzymatic browning. Inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 17.0 to 37.1% in peach flesh extract, from 15.2 to 49.8% in whole peach extract, and from 18.2 to 48.1% in peel extract. Total phenols were 432.8-768.1 mg/kg in flesh extract, 483.3-803.0 mg/kg in whole extract, and 910.9-1922.9 mg/kg in peel extract. The correlation coefficient between relative LDL antioxidant activity and concentration of total phenols was 0.76. Peel PPO activity was higher than flesh activity in most cultivars. The lowest PPO and specific activities were found in the Walgant cultivar, followed by Kakamas and 18-8-23. These three cultivars combine the desirable characteristics of strong antioxidant activity, low PPO activity, and lower susceptibility to browning reactions.",1

"Identification, quantitative determination, and antioxidative activities of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune (Prunus domestica L.) Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed antioxidative activities which were almost the same.",0
"Yoghurt impacts on the excretion of phenolic acids derived from colonic breakdown of orange juice flavanones in humans Human urine was collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of (i) water, (ii) orange juice, and (iii) orange juice plus 150 mL of full fat natural yoghurt. The orange juice contained 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic microbiota.",1

"Simultaneous separation of flavanone glycosides and polymethoxylated flavones in citrus juices using liquid chromatography We present a simultaneous liquid chromatographic method for the separation of two flavonoid compound families, flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), which are usually found in citrus fruits species and varieties. This technique permits the quantitation of six FGs (narirutin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, poncirin) and six PMFs (sinensetin, hexamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, scutellarein, heptamethoxyflavone and tangeretin). This technique, to be used to characterize a citrus juice by its polyphenolic profile, has been applied to the determination of flavonoid compounds in grapefruit- and orange juice. Differentiation of orange juice varieties and mixtures containing tangor juice using polyphenolic profiles and flavonoid content has been achieved.",0
"Anthocyanin excretion by humans increases linearly with increasing strawberry dose A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.",1
"Effect of ripeness and postharvest storage on the phenolic profiles of cherries (Prunus avium L.) The phenolic compounds hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavan-3-ols of sweet cherry cultivars Burlat, Saco, Summit, and Van harvested in 2001 and 2002 were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Phenolics were analyzed at partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these compounds.",1
"Content of CYP3A4 inhibitors, naringin, naringenin and bergapten in grapefruit and grapefruit juice products The flavonoids, naringin and naringenin and the furanocoumarin, bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen), were detected in some fresh grapefruit and commercial grapefruit juices but were not detected in other fruit juices tested (orange; orange with apple base; dark grape; orange and mango with apple base; orange, peach, passion fruit juice). The contents of these three grapefruit constituents in commercial juice and fresh grapefruit varied from brand to brand and also from lot to lot. Juice was prepared from the fresh fruit via different methods (by hand, squeezer or blender). The naringin content, after hand-squeeze, ranged from 115 to 384 mg/l. With hand-squeeze juice production, bergapten was not detected (less than 0.5 mg/l) in two varieties of grapefruit, and naringenin was usually not in detectable levels (less than 2 mg/l) in three varieties. All three constituents were present in New Zealand grapefruit preparations (including juice by hand-squeeze) and different lots showed variation in content (1.5-, 2.3- and 4.7-fold for naringin, naringenin and bergapten, respectively). Differences in the concentrations of these three constituents, which have potential for drug interaction, may contribute to the variability in pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 drugs and some contradictory results of drug interaction studies with grapefruit juice.",1

"LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of ethyl gallate and its major metabolite in rat plasma A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of ethyl gallate, a pharmacologically active constituent isolated from Lagerstroemia speciosa (Linn.) Pers. This method was used to examine the pharmacokinetics of ethyl gallate and its major metabolite gallic acid in rat plasma using propyl gallate as an internal standard. After precipitation of the plasma proteins with acetonitrile, the analytes were separated on a Zorbax SB-C(18) column (3.5 microm, 2.1 x 50 mm) with an isocratic mobile phase consisted of methanol-acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate (10 : 25 : 65, v/v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The Agilent G6410A triple quadrupole LC/MS system was operated under the multiple-reaction monitoring mode using the electrospray ionization technique in negative mode. The lower limits of quantification of gallic acid and ethyl gallate of the method were 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of the assay were less than 8.0%. This method has been applied successfully to a pharmacokinetic study involving the intragastric administration of ethyl gallate to rats.",1
"Isoflavone levels in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and Hawaii Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving sizes.",1

"Phytochemical phenolics in organically grown vegetables Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic agents in pac choi.",1

"Flavonoid content of U.S. fruits, vegetables, and nuts Analytical data are reported for 20 flavonoids (as aglycones) determined for more than 60 fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts collected from four regions across the United States at two times of the year. Sample collection was designed and implemented by the Nutrient Data Laboratory (USDA). Analyses of eight flavan-3-ols (catechin, catechin gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and gallocatechin gallate), six anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin), two flavanones (hesperetin and naringenin), two flavones (apigenin and luteolin), and two flavonols (myricetin and quercetin) were performed by the Food Composition Laboratory (USDA) using a hydrolysis method for the anthocyanidins, flavones, and flavonols and a direct extraction method for the flavan-3-ols and flavanones. Experimental results compare favorably (few statistically significant differences) to literature values in the flavonoid and proanthocyanidin database previously compiled by the Nutrient Data Laboratory. The results of this study showed a seasonal variation only for blueberries. This study also showed that the variation in the flavonoid content of foods, as purchased by the U.S. consumer, is very large.

Quercetin, kaempferol, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and vanillic acid mean contents were 10.9, 52.3, 10.1, 9.6, 5.4, and 18.2 microg/g, respectively; raffinose, stachyose, verbascose, and phytic acid mean contents were 8.5, 56.3, 5.5, and 11.5 mg/g, respectively, in raw seeds. All compounds were affected by autoclaving, and germination resulted in a de novo synthesis of flavonols, phytoestrogens, and phenolic acids. The impact on health of common bean seed is affected by dietary burden, specific compounds content, and processing. On the other hand, germinated bean seed or beans sprouts may be sources of antioxidants and phytoestrogens.",1

"Antioxidant activity and total phenolics in selected cereal grains and their different morphological fractions The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.",0
"Pistachio skin phenolics are destroyed by bleaching resulting in reduced antioxidative capacities Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 (25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from pistachio consumption.",1
"Pelargonidin is absorbed and metabolized differently than cyanidin after marionberry consumption in pigs Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.",1
"Metabolic analysis of four phenolic acids in rat by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry A liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS(n)) method was established for the analysis of danshensu, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid in rat plasma, bile, urine and feces after oral administration or intravenous injection. Liquid-liquid extraction was employed for the preparation of biosamples, and the chromatographic separation was carried out using an Agilent Zorbax Extend C(18) reversed phase column and acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. Totally nineteen metabolites were detected and identified as prototype, methylated, hydroxylated, sulfated and glucuronized conjugates. The metabolism of the individual phenolic acids in biosamples was investigated, and the metabolic pathway was proposed. By comparing the metabolism of different compounds which shared similar structures, we were able to find that methylation was the main pathway of danshensu metabolism, and the double bond on the side chain was critical for the drug excretion via bile and the formation of glucuronized conjugates. The results proved that the established method was simple, sensitive and reliable, which could be used to detect and identify the structures of metabolites and to better understand their in vivo metabolism.",0

"The antioxidative substances in cacao liquor The antioxidative substances contained in cacao liquor, which is one of the major ingredients of chocolate, were separated by column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Three major compounds were purified and two of them were identified by 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectra as (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (CA). Their antioxidative activity was measured by monitoring the peroxide value of linoleic acid and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance values of erythrocyte ghost membranes and microsomes. EC and CA had strong antioxidative effects in all three methods, but one unidentified peak was found to be less effective. Additionally, we analyzed the polyphenol concentration of cacao liquor extractions produced in several countries. The total polyphenol concentration was 7.0 to 13.0%, catechin concentration was 0.31 to 0.49%, and epicatechin concentration was 0.35 to 1.68% in the extractions. It is believed that chocolate is stable against oxidative deterioration on account of the presence of these polyphenolic compounds, and it is also expected to have a protective role against lipid peroxidation in living systems.",1

"Quantitative determination of isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol in rat plasma by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and its application to the pharmacokin A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the quantification of quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in rat plasma. After being treated with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase, the analytes were extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with the internal standard (IS; baicalein). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Diamonsil C(18) column with a mobile phase consisting of 2% formic acid/methanol (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min, with a split of 200 microL to the mass spectrometer. Validation results indicated that the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1 ng . mL(-1). The assay exhibited a linear range of 1-200 ng . mL(-1) and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9980 or better for each analyte. Quality control samples (1, 5, 20 and 100 ng . mL(-1)) in six replicates from each of three different runs demonstrated an intra-assay precision (RSD) of 1.1-8.9%, an inter-assay precision of 1.6-10.8%, and an overall accuracy (bias) of <13.4%. The extraction recovery of each analyte and internal standard was 70-80%. In the present study, we have investigated the pharmacokinetic profiles of isorhamnetin after oral application in rats equipped with a jugular catheter. After oral dosing of isorhamnetin, the mean values (n = 10) of C(max) were 57.8, 64.8 and 75.2 ng . mL(-1) which were achieved at a T(max) of 8.0, 6.4 and 7.2 h for oral doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg . kg(-1) body weight, respectively. The corresponding mean values for isorhamnetin area under the curver (AUC) from 0 to 60 h were 838.2, 1262.8, 1623.4 ng . h . mL(-1). Our results further demonstrated that the samples analyzed showed isorhamnetin could not be transformed into quercetin or kaempferol in rats, indicating that the demethylation of the 3'-oxymethyl group of isorhamnetin does not occur in Wistar rats.",0

"Contribution of individual polyphenolics to total antioxidant capacity of plums To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant capacities of plums, the amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids and individual phenolic compounds, and vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) of eleven plum cultivars was determined. There was a good linear relationship between the amount of total phenolics and total antioxidant capacity (r2 = 0.9887). The amount of total flavonoids and total antioxidant capacity also showed a good correlation (r2 = 0.9653). Although the summation of individual antioxidant capacity was lower than the total antioxidant capacity of plum samples, there was a positive correlation (r2 = 0.9299) of total antioxidant capacity of plum samples with the sum of the VCEACs calculated from individual phenolics. Chlorogenic acids and glycosides of cyanidin, peonidin, and quercetin were major phenolics among eleven plum cultivars. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acids and anthocyanins showed higher correlation (r2) of 0.7751 and 0.6616 to total VCEAC, respectively, than that of quercetin glycosides (r2 = 0.0279). Chlorogenic acids were a major source of antioxidant activity in plums, and the consumption of one serving (100 g) of plums can provide antioxidants equivalent to 144.4-889.6 mg of vitamin C.",1
"Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 % w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order to prevent chronic diseases.",1
"Comparison of extraction methods for the quantification of selected phytochemicals in peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) Peanuts have been reported to contain bioactive phytochemicals, particularly isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and biochanin A) and trans-resveratrol. Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.",1

"Accumulation of quercetin conjugates in blood plasma after the short-term ingestion of onion by women Quercetin is a typical flavonoid present mostly as glycosides in plant foods; it has attracted much attention for its potential beneficial effects in disease prevention. In this study, we examined human volunteers after the short-term ingestion of onion, a vegetable rich in quercetin glucosides. The subjects were served diets containing onion slices (quercetin equivalent: 67.6-93.6 mg/day) with meals for 1 wk. Quercetin was only found in glucuronidase-sulfatase-treated plasma, and its concentration after 10 h of fasting increased from 0.04 +/- 0.04 microM before the trial to 0.63 +/- 0.72 microM after the 1-wk trial. The quercetin content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after glucuronidase-sulfatase treatment corresponded to <1% of the alpha-tocopherol content. Human LDL isolated from the plasma after the trial showed little improvement of its resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation. It is therefore concluded that conjugated metabolites of quercetin accumulate exclusively in human blood plasma in the concentration range of 10(-7) approximately 10(-6) M after the short-term ingestion of vegetables rich in quercetin glucosides, although these metabolites are hardly incorporated into plasma LDL.",1

"Major phenolics in apple and their contribution to the total antioxidant capacity The contribution of each phytochemical to the total antioxidant capacity of apples was determined. Major phenolic phytochemicals of six apple cultivars were identified and quantified, and their contributions to total antioxidant activity of apples were determined using a 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay and expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). Average concentrations of major phenolics and vitamin C in six apple cultivars were as follows (mg/100 g of fresh weight of apples): quercetin glycosides, 13.20; procyanidin B(2), 9.35; chlorogenic acid, 9.02; epicatechin, 8.65; phloretin glycosides, 5.59; vitamin C, 12.80. A highly linear relationship (r (2) > 0.97) was attained between concentrations and total antioxidant capacity of phenolics and vitamin C. Relative VCEAC values of these compounds were in the order quercetin (3.06) > epicatechin (2.67) > procyanidin B(2) (2.36) > phloretin (1.63) > vitamin C (1.00) > chlorogenic acid (0.97). Therefore, the estimated contribution of major phenolics and vitamin C to the total antioxidant capacity of 100 g of fresh apples is as follows: quercetin (40.39 VCEAC) > epicatechin (23.10) > procyanidin B(2) (22.07) > vitamin C (12.80) > phloretin (9.11) > chlorogenic acid (8.75). These results indicate that flavonoids such as quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B(2) rather than vitamin C contribute significantly to the total antioxidant activity of apples.",1
"Rat gastrointestinal tissues metabolize quercetin Quercetin and quercetin glycosides from food or dietary supplements appear in body tissues almost exclusively as glucuronated, sulfated, and methylated quercetin conjugates, suggesting that the in vivo bioactivity of quercetin may be due to its metabolites. In this study, pre- and postabsorptive metabolism of orally ingested quercetin was examined by comparing the metabolite pattern in gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, contents, and internal tissues. F344 rats (n = 6) were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 0.45% quercetin and the metabolite patterns were determined in the tissues and contents of stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon and in liver, kidney, and plasma using LC-MS/MS. GI contents contained predominantly unmetabolized quercetin at 94-100%, whereas quercetin in GI tissues was present as 11 different sulfated, glucuronated, and methylated metabolites at 32% in stomach, 88% in small intestine, 27% in cecum, and 46% in colon. Quercetin was further metabolized postabsorption and found in liver, kidney, and plasma almost exclusively as sulfated methyl-quercetin glucuronide. The unique pattern of quercetin metabolites in each GI tissue indicates extensive biotransformation before absorption and distribution in rats.",1

"Phytoestrogen content of foods consumed in Canada, including isoflavones, lignans, and coumestan Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, including coumestrol, were identified. The database will improve phytoestrogen intake estimation in future epidemiological and clinical studies particularly in Western populations.",1

"Flavanone plasma pharmacokinetics from blood orange juice in human subjects Some blood orange juice (BOJ) flavanones may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hypolipidaemic, vasoprotective and anticarcinogenic properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of hesperetin and naringenin in human subjects after BOJ intake. In a cross-over study, seven healthy female volunteers consumed 150 and 300 ml BOJ corresponding to about 51-102 mg hesperetin and to 6-12 mg naringenin, respectively. Plasma samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after BOJ administration and analysed for their content of hesperetin and naringenin by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. The plasma concentrations of these compounds were dose dependent and the peak concentration (Cmax) was reached in 5.1 (sd 0.6) h after BOJ intake. The Cmax of hesperetin was 43.4 (sd 32.4) and 79.8 (sd 60.1) ng/ml after 150 and 300 ml intake, respectively. For naringenin the plasma peak was 16.4 (sd 11.9) and 34.0 (sd 20.6) ng/ml. Moreover, the conjugated forms of these flavanones represent more than 95 % of the plasma concentration. The results indicate that both hesperetin and naringenin are bioavailable after BOJ intake; naringenin seemingly more so than hesperetin.",1

"Urinary excretion of lignans after administration of isolated plant lignans to rats: the effect of single dose and ten-day exposures The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a considerably higher excretion than after a single dose.

"Uptake and metabolism of epicatechin and its access to the brain after oral ingestion Epicatechin is a flavan-3-ol that is commonly present in green teas, red wine, cocoa products, and many fruits, such as apples. There is considerable interest in the bioavailability of epicatechin after oral ingestion. In vivo studies have shown that low levels of epicatechin are absorbed and found in the circulation as glucuronides, methylated and sulfated forms. Recent research has demonstrated protective effects of epicatechin and one of its in vivo metabolites, 3'-O-methyl epicatechin, against neuronal cell death induced by oxidative stress. Thus, we are interested in the ability of ingested epicatechin to cross the blood brain barrier and target the brain. Rats were administered 100 mg/kg body weight/d epicatechin orally for 1, 5, and 10 d. Plasma and brain extracts were analyzed by HPLC with photodiode array detection and LC-MS/MS. This study reports the presence of the epicatechin glucuronide and 3'-O-methyl epicatechin glucuronide formed after oral ingestion in the rat brain tissue.",1

"Hydroxytyrosol 4-b-D-glucoside, an important phenolic compound in olive fruits and derived products There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside (4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol [(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these products.",1

During refrigerated storage of fresh juice (4 degrees C), 50% of the soluble flavanones precipitate and integrate into the cloud fraction. Commercial orange juices contain only 81-200 mg/L soluble flavanones (15-33%) and the content in the cloud is higher (206-644 mg/L) (62-85%), showing that during industrial processing and storage the soluble flavanones precipitate and are included in the cloud. An in vitro simulation of orange juice digestion shows that a serving of fresh orange juice (240 mL) provides 9.7 mg of soluble hesperidin (4'-methoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) and 4.7 mg of the C-glycosylflavone vicenin 2 (apigenin, 6,8-di-C-glucoside) for freshly squeezed orange juice, whereas pasteurized commercial juices provide 3.7 mg of soluble hesperidin and a higher amount of vicenin 2 (6.3 mg). This means that although orange juice is a very rich source of flavanones, only a limited quantity is soluble, and this might affect availability for absorption (11-36% of the soluble flavanones, depending on the juice). The flavanones precipitated in the cloud are not available for absorption and are partly transformed to the corresponding chalcones during the pancreatin-bile digestion.",1
"Comparison of GC-MS and LC-MS methods for the analysis of antioxidant phenolic acids in herbs Two methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids in herb extracts. The methods were based on liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The methods were compared in terms of their linearity, repeatability, selectivity, sensitivity and the speed of the analysis. The sensitivity was good for both methods, with limits of detection of <80 ng/ml for most of the compounds. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas were on average 7.2% for the LC-TOFMS method and 1.4% for the GC-MS method. Both methods were found to be suitable for the determination of the target analytes, although GC-MS was better suited to the quantitative determination of compounds present at low concentrations.",1
"Chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-rutinoside and black tea phenols are extensively metabolized in humans Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid (major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.",1
"Evaluation of Phenolic Profile and Antioxidant Properties of Pardina Lentil As Affected by Industrial Dehydration This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols (17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.",1
"Polyphenol profiles of apple juices Focusing on 17 constituents, the polyphenol profiles of juices freshly made from various dessert (n = 4) and cider apple cultivars (n = 7) as well as commercially available apple juices (n = 24) were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and (HPLC)-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI(neg)-MS/MS) analyses. Significant differences in the total polyphenol content as well as the profiles of the apple cultivars under study were observed. For dessert apples the total polyphenol content ranged from 154 to 178 mg/L, whereas for 'old' German cider apple cultivars 261-970 mg/L were determined. Boskoop showed the highest (970 mg/L) and Granny Smith the lowest (154 mg/L) polyphenol content of the freshly prepared samples under study. Hydroxycinnamic acids, with chlorogenic acid as dominating constituent, ranged from 57 to 68 mg/L as well as from 134-593 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that from cider apples, respectively. Dessert apple juices showed lower contents of dihydrochalcones (10-35 mg/L) and flavan-3-ols (50-95 mg/L) compared to that of cider apples (34-171 mg/L and 70-393 mg/L, respectively). Quercetin and its derivatives were found from 0.4-4 mg/L and 0.4-27 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that of cider apples, respectively. Compared with freshly made juices, lower contents of polyphenols were determined in the commercial samples under study. Amounts ranging from 110-459 mg/L, dominated by chlorogenic acid with concentrations from 53-217 mg/L, were determined. Information about cultivar-typical apple polyphenol content and profile is important for bioactivity studies and, consequently, essential for the development of consumer-relevant products with particular nutritional functionalities.",0

"Urinary and plasma levels of resveratrol and quercetin in humans, mice, and rats after ingestion of pure compounds and grape juice The present study investigates the bioavailability of resveratrol and quercetin in humans, mice, and rats after oral ingestion of grape juice preparations or pure aglycones. Oral administration of resveratrol and quercetin to humans yielded detectable levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their derivatives in the plasma and urine. Urinary levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their metabolites were observed in human subjects receiving 600 and 1200 mL of grape juice, whereas quercetin metabolites were identified in urine samples even after receiving 200 mL of grape juice. The cumulative amounts of resveratrol and quercetin excreted in the urine of mice receiving concentrated grape juice for 4 days were 2.3 and 0.7% of the ingested doses, respectively. After i.g. administration of resveratrol to rats (2 mg/kg), up to 1.2 microM resveratrol was observed in the plasma. The study demonstrates that the glycoside forms of resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice are absorbed to a lesser extent than the aglycones.",1

"Anthocyanin composition in black, blue, pink, purple, and red cereal grains Anthocyanin pigments from a wide variety of edible and ornamental black, blue, pink, purple, red, and white wheat, barley, corn, rice, and wild rice were identified and quantified to evaluate their potential as natural colorants or functional food ingredients. The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly and exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and black rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as blue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 anthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. The remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of spectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most abundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in blue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and delphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.",0

"Identification of metabolites of (-)-epicatechin gallate and their metabolic fate in the rat After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' '-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate orally administered to the rat is proposed.",1
"Targeted metabolic profiling of phenolics in urine and plasma after regular consumption of cocoa by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.",1
"Variability of the polyphenolic composition of cider apple (Malus domestica) fruits and juices Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close to 80 and 30%, respectively.",0
"Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the isoflavone biochanin A in rats Biochanin A (BCA) is a dietary isoflavone present in legumes, most notably red clover, and in many herbal dietary supplements. BCA has been reported to have chemopreventive properties and is metabolized to the isoflavone genistein (GEN), BCA conjugates, and GEN conjugates. The metabolites may contribute to the chemopreventive effects of BCA. The absorption, metabolism, and disposition of BCA have not been determined in rats. Our objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered BCA by intravenous injection (1 and 5 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal injection (5 and 50 mg/kg), and orally (5 and 50 mg/kg). Plasma and bile samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed in vitro to determine conjugate concentrations for BCA and GEN. Equilibrium dialysis was used to determine protein binding. The BCA and GEN concentrations in plasma, urine, and bile were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters of BCA were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. Significant levels of BCA conjugates and GEN conjugates were detected in plasma and bile. Both BCA and GEN were found to have a high clearance and a large apparent volume of distribution; the bioavailability of both was poor (<4%). Reentry peaks were evident after oral administration of both BCA and GEN, suggesting enterohepatic cycling. The free fraction of BCA in rat plasma was 1.5%. A 2-compartment model that included both linear and nonlinear clearance terms and enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first evaluation of the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats.",1

"Quercetin pharmacokinetics in humans The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.",0
"Influence of glucose on cyanidin 3-glucoside absorption in rats Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various health effects. However their mechanisms of absorption are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of glucose on anthocyanin absorption in rats. We first studied anthocyanin bioavailability in rats that received by gastric intubation approximately 53 micromol cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) equivalents from a red orange extract with or without 2.51 mmol glucose. Neither 24-h urinary anthocyanin excretion nor plasma anthocyanin concentration was significantly affected by simultaneous ingestion of glucose. The influence of glucose (12, 42 or 72 mM) on intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc (pure or from a red orange extract; approximately 12.3 microM) was further studied using an in situ intestinal perfusion model. Absorption of pure Cy 3-glc from the intestinal lumen was not significantly affected by the amount of glucose. However, intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc from the red orange extract (6.49 +/- 1.44%, n = 6) was significantly less than that of pure Cy 3-glc (17.5 +/- 1.3%, n = 7) (p < 0.01) suggesting that the red orange extract contained other components that were able to interfere with Cy 3-glc intestinal absorption. This study has thus shown that glucose did not interfere with anthocyanin glucoside absorption.",0
"Metabolite profiling of hydroxycinnamate derivatives in plasma and urine after the ingestion of coffee by humans: identification of biomarkers of coffee consumption Human subjects drank coffee containing 412 mumol of chlorogenic acids, and plasma and urine were collected 0 to 24 h after ingestion and were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within 1 h, some of the components in the coffee reached nanomole peak plasma concentrations (C(max)), whereas chlorogenic acid metabolites, including caffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and sulfates of 3- and 4-caffeoylquinic acid lactones, had higher C(max) values. The short time to reach C(max) (T(max)) indicates absorption of these compounds in the small intestine. In contrast, dihydroferulic acid, its 4-O-sulfate, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate exhibited much higher C(max) values (145-385 nM) with T(max) values in excess of 4 h, indicating absorption in the large intestine and the probable involvement of catabolism by colonic bacteria. These three compounds, along with ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and dihydroferulic acid-4-O-glucuronide, were also major components to be excreted in urine (8.4-37.1 mumol) after coffee intake. Feruloylglycine, which is not detected in plasma, was also a major urinary component (20.7 mumol excreted). Other compounds, not accumulating in plasma but excreted in smaller quantities, included the 3-O-sulfate and 3-O-glucuronide of isoferulic acid, dihydro(iso)ferulic acid-3-O-glucuronide, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-glucuronide. Overall, the 119.9 mumol excretion of the chlorogenic acid metabolites corresponded to 29.1% of intake, indicating that as well as being subject to extensive metabolism, chlorogenic acids in coffee are well absorbed. Pathways for the formation of the various metabolites within the body are proposed. Urinary dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and feruloylglycine are potentially very sensitive biomarkers for the consumption of relatively small amounts of coffee.",1
"Effects of Genetic, Pre- and Post-Harvest Factors on Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Capacity of White Asparagus Spears The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.",1
"Absorption and pharmacokinetics of green tea catechins in beagles The present study evaluates for the first time in dogs, the kinetics of green tea catechins and their metabolic forms in plasma and urine. Ten beagles were administered 173 mg (12.35 mg/kg body weight) of catechins as a green tea extract, in capsules. Blood samples were collected during 24 h after intake and urine samples were collected during the following periods of time: 0-2, 2-6, 6-8 and 8-24 h. Two catechins with a galloyl moiety and three conjugated metabolites were detected in plasma. Most of the detected forms in plasma reached their maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at around 1 h. Median Cmax for ( - )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ( - )-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( - )-epigallocatechin glucuronide (EGC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin glucuronide (EC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin sulphate (EC-sulphate) were 0.3 (range 0.1-1.9), 0.1 (range 0-0.4), 0.8 (range 0.2-3.9), 0.2 (range 0.1-1.7) and 1 (range 0.3-3.4) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the plasma concentration v. time curves (AUC0 --> 24) were 427 (range 102-1185) micromol/l x min for EGC-glucuronide, 112 (range 53-919) micromol/l x min for EC-sulphate, 71 (range 26-306) micromol/l x min for EGCG, 40 (range 12-258) micromol/l x min for EC-glucuronide and 14 (range 0.1-124) micromol/l x min for ECG. The values of mean residence time (MRT0 --> 24) were 5 (range 2-16), 2 (range 1-11), 10 (range 2-13), 3 (range 2-16) and 2.4 (range 1-18) h for EGCG, ECG, EGC-glucuronide, EC-glucuronide and EC-sulphate, respectively. In urine, catechins were present as conjugated forms, suggesting bile excretion of EGCG and ECG. Green tea catechins are absorbed following an oral administration and EGC-glucuronide is the metabolic form that remains in the organism for a longer period of time, suggesting that this compound could suffer an enterohepatic cycle.",1
"High absorption but very low bioavailability of oral resveratrol in humans The dietary polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to have chemopreventive activity against cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers in model systems, but it is not clear whether the drug reaches the proposed sites of action in vivo after oral ingestion, especially in humans. In this study, we examined the absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of 14C-resveratrol after oral and i.v. doses in six human volunteers. The absorption of a dietary relevant 25-mg oral dose was at least 70%, with peak plasma levels of resveratrol and metabolites of 491 +/- 90 ng/ml (about 2 microM) and a plasma half-life of 9.2 +/- 0.6 h. However, only trace amounts of unchanged resveratrol (<5 ng/ml) could be detected in plasma. Most of the oral dose was recovered in urine, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis identified three metabolic pathways, i.e., sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation of the phenolic groups and, interestingly, hydrogenation of the aliphatic double bond, the latter likely produced by the intestinal microflora. Extremely rapid sulfate conjugation by the intestine/liver appears to be the rate-limiting step in resveratrol's bioavailability. Although the systemic bioavailability of resveratrol is very low, accumulation of resveratrol in epithelial cells along the aerodigestive tract and potentially active resveratrol metabolites may still produce cancer-preventive and other effects.",1
"Hydroxytyrosol excretion differs between rats and humans and depends on the vehicle of administration Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt (5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be carefully formulated.",0
"Storage effects on anthocyanins, phenolics and antioxidant activity of thermally processed conventional and organic blueberries Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for phytochemicals during their long-term storage.",1
"Multivariate methods for characterization and classification of espresso coffees from different botanical varieties and types of roast by foam, taste, and mouthfeel Three espresso coffee (EC) samples of different botanical varieties and types of roast were prepared in standard conditions using an experimental EC prototype: Arabica coffee, Robusta Natural blend, and Robusta Torrefacto blend (a special roast by adding sugar). The ECs were characterized with regard to the physical parameters, amount of total solids, total solids on filtrate, lipids, caffeine, trigonelline, and chlorogenic acids by HPLC, and sensory descriptive analysis related to foam appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate the EC samples. Arabica and Robusta samples were separated successfully by principal component 1 (55.3% of variance) including physicochemical and sensory parameters related to foam and taste of ECs. Torrefacto and Robusta Natural EC samples were separated by principal component 2 (20.7% of total variance) including mouthfeel and other attributes of color foam. Some interesting correlations among sensory and physicochemical variables were found. A very simple discriminate function was obtained by discriminate analysis allowing the classification of each EC sample into its respective group with a success rate of 100%.",0
"Phenolic acids in berries, fruits, and beverages The contents of soluble and total phenolic acids were analyzed in samples of 29 berries and berry products, 24 fruits and fruit peels, and 12 beverages. Variation of phenolic acids in berries was also studied. Soluble phenolic acids were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, and a tentative quantification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total phenolic acid content was determined by HPLC after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The content of total phenolic acids as aglycones in the above samples varied from 0 (pear cider) to 103 mg/100 g fresh weight (rowanberry). Besides rowanberry, the best phenolic acid sources among berries were chokeberry (96 mg/100 g), blueberry (85 mg/100 g), sweet rowanberry (75 mg/100 g), and saskatoon berry (59 mg/100 g). Among fruits, the highest contents (28 mg/100 g) were determined in dark plum, cherry, and one apple variety (Valkea Kuulas). Coffee (97 mg/100 g) as well as green and black teas (30-36 mg/100 g) were the best sources among beverages. Caffeic acid dominated in all of these samples except in tea brews. Variation in the phenolic acid contents of the berries was either small or moderate.",0

"Changes in volatile and phenolic compounds with malaxation time and temperature during virgin olive oil production Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids (FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde (3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil extraction.",1
"Table olives from Portugal: phenolic compounds, antioxidant potential, and microbial activity The phenolic compounds composition, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity of different table olives from Portugal, namely, natural black olives ""Galega"", black ripe olive ""Negrinha de Freixo"", Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) ""Azeitona de Conserva Negrinha de Freixo"" olives, and ""Azeitona de Conserva de Elvas e Campo Maior"" Designation of Origin (DO) olives, were investigated. The analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and seven compounds were identified and quantified: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, 5-O-caffeoilquinic acid, verbascoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, and luteolin. The antioxidant activity was assessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals, and the beta-carotene linoleate model system. The antioxidant activity was correlated with the amount of phenolics found in each sample. The antimicrobial activity was screened using Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). PDO and DO table olives revealed a wide range of antimicrobial activity. C. albicans was resistant to all the analyzed extracts.",1

"Changes in phenolic content of tomato products during storage The effect of storage on the total polyphenol content and individual phenolic compounds as well as on the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity of ketchups and tomato juices was studied. The total polyphenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction was determined using DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. Individual polyphenols were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole. All analyses were carried out for ketchups and tomato juices after storage for 3, 6, and 9 months. The total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction decreased during storage of ketchups and tomato juices. Ketchups, in general, showed a slightly greater stability during storage than tomato juices. The most significant decrease was observed for quercetin followed by caffeic and ferulic acids, whereas glycosilated polyphenols showed greater stability during storage.",0
"Induction of antioxidant flavonol biosynthesis in fresh-cut potatoes. Effect of domestic cooking The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.",1
"Isoflavonoid Content of Hong Kong Soy Foods Progress in understanding the effects of dietary soy isoflavones on chronic disease prevention in the Hong Kong Chinese population has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive soy isoflavone database. In this study, we determined the concentrations and distribution of isoflavones in 47 foods included in a soy food frequency questionnaire by reverse-phase HPLC. Results indicated that most soy products contained isoflavones ranging from 1 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight (bean strip noodle and egg bean curd) to 80 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight (oyster sauce soybean and sweet bean curd sheet). Among our food groups, mean isoflavone concentrations were lowest in the soy milk group (9.99 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight) and highest in the bean curd skin group (40 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight). The conjugation patterns of isoflavones varied within and between food groups as influenced by the types of soybeans and the processing or cooking techniques used. The isoflavone concentrations reported herein will be useful for ascertaining the relationship between exposure to dietary soy isoflavones and health effects in the Chinese population.",1

"Formation and identification of 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin in humans The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine within 8 h. The present structural information and concentration-time profile of this metabolite provide the basis for understanding the biotransformation of EGC and for future elucidation of its biological activities.",0
"Influence of sample preparation on assay of phenolic acids from eggplant Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction. The total amount of caffeic acid extracted from the Italian Neon cultivar was more that twice that of four other eggplant cultivars (Orient Express, Calliope Zebra Stripe, Orient Charm Neon, and Black Beauty).",1

"Separation and determination of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds in cranberry juice by high-performance liquid chromatography A HPLC method was developed for the separation and determination of flavonoid and phenolic antioxidants in cranberry juices. Free flavonoid and phenolic compounds were fractionated into neutral and acidic groups by means of a solid-phase extraction method, followed by subsequent HPLC separations. Combined flavonoids and phenolics were hydrolyzed by acid before HPLC analysis. This developed method provides a fast and high resolution of individual flavonoid and phenolic compounds. In cranberry fruit, flavonoids and phenolic acids exist predominantly in combined forms, such as glycosides and esters. A total of 400 mg of total flavonoids and phenolic compounds/l of sample was found in a freshly squeezed cranberry juice, which was distributed as about 44% of phenolic acids and 56% of flavonoids. Benzoic acid was the major phenolic compound. Major flavonoids in the freshly squeezed cranberry juice were quercetin and myricetin.",1

"Simultaneous determination of diosmin and diosmetin in human plasma by ion trap liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry: Application to a clinical pharm Diosmetin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) is the aglycone of the flavonoid glycoside diosmin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone-7-ramnoglucoside). Diosmin is hydrolyzed by enzymes of intestinal micro flora before absorption of its aglycone diosmetin. A specific, sensitive, precise, accurate and robust HPLC assay for the simultaneous determination of diosmin and diosmetin in human plasma was developed and validated. Plasma samples were incubated with beta-glucuronidase/sulphatase. The analytes were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether at pH 2, and separated on a C(18) reversed-phase column using a mixture of methanol/1% formic acid (58:42, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. APCI in the positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was employed. The selected transitions for diosmin, diosmetin and the internal standard (7-ethoxycoumarin) at m/z were: 609.0-->463.0, 301.2-->286.1 and 191, respectively. A good linearity was found in the range of 0.25-500ng/ml (R(2)>0.992) for both compounds. The intra-batch assay precision (CV) for diosmin and diosmetin ranged from 1.5% to 11.2% and from 2.8% to 12.5%, respectively, and the inter-batch precision were from 5.2% to 11.5% and 8.5% to 9.8%, respectively. The accuracy was well within the acceptable range the accuracies (from -2.7% to 4.2% and -1.6% to 3.5% for diosmin and diosmetin, respectively). The mean recoveries of diosmin, diosmetin and the internal standard were 87.5%, 89.2% and 67.2%. Stability studies showed that diosmin and diosmetin were stable in different conditions. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of diosmin in healthy volunteers following a single oral administration (Daflon).",0

"Quantitative analysis of plasma caffeic and ferulic acid equivalents by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid (FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites (sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM).

"Effect of drying of figs (Ficus carica L.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, and phenolic compounds Fresh figs were subjected to two different drying processes: sun-drying and oven-drying. To assess their effect on the nutritional and health-related properties of figs, sugars, organic acids, single phenolics, total phenolics, and antioxidant activity were determined before and after processing. Samples were analyzed three times in a year, and phenolic compounds were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). In figs, monomer sugars predominate, which is important nutritional information, and the content of sugars as well as organic acids in fresh figs was lower than in dried fruits. However, the best sugar/organic acid ratio was measured after the sun-drying process. Analysis of individual phenolic compounds revealed a higher content of all phenolic groups determined after the oven-drying process, with the exception of cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside. Similarly, higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were detected after the drying process. With these results it can be concluded that the differences in analyzed compounds in fresh and dried figs are significant. The differences between the sun-dried and oven-dried fruits were determined in organic acids, sugars, chlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, luteolin-8-C-glucoside, and total phenolic contents. The results indicate that properly dried figs can be used as a good source of phenolic compounds.",0
"Levels of stilbene oligomers and astilbin in French varietal wines and in grapes during noble rot development Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.",0

"High Performance Liquid Chromatographic Determination of Phenolic Acids in Fruits and Vegetables A simple isocratic HPLC technique has been developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids (PAs) in fruits and vegetables. Nine benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives were separated in less than 30 min, and the resolution was all more than 1.23. The ranges of linearity for PAs standards were 0.2-100 ng, even up to 600 ng (r = 0.983-1.000) and the detection limits were 0.02-0.24 mg/kg. Samples of fresh vegetables and fruits were extracted with 80% methanol and ethyl acetate, then purified with C18 Sep-Pak cartridge and determined by HPLC. This method was applied to the determination of PAs in 7 kinds of fruits and vegetables, i.e., apple, pear, Chinese cabbage, cauliflower, turnip, soybean sprout and white grape wine. The content of the 9 PAs varied widely in the 7 kinds of foods studied. The average concentrations of chlorogenic acid in apple (100.2 mg/kg) and pear (30.8 mg/kg) were quite high, and sinapinic acid was remarkable (42.5 mg/kg) in Chinese cabbage, and protocatechuic acid had the highest concentration of all the PAs in white wine.",1

"Piceid, the major resveratrol derivative in grape juices The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white wines.

"Alkylperoxyl radical scavenging activity of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) phenolics Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA > DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.",1

"Pomegranate juice and extracts provide similar levels of plasma and urinary ellagitannin metabolites in human subjects Pomegranate juice (PJ), a rich source of polyphenols including ellagitannins, has attracted much attention due to its reported health benefits. This has resulted in the consumption of liquid and powder pomegranate extracts as alternatives to PJ. Therefore establishing the bioavailability of polyphenols from these extract preparations is necessary. Sixteen healthy volunteers sequentially consumed, with a 1-week washout period between treatments, PJ (8 ounces, Wonderful fruit variety), a pomegranate polyphenol liquid extract (POMxl, 8 ounces), and a pomegranate polyphenol powder extract (POMxp, 1,000 mg). The three interventions provided 857, 776, and 755 mg of polyphenols as gallic acid equivalents, respectively. Plasma bioavailability, judged based on ellagic acid levels over a 6-hour period, did not show statistical differences in area under the curve for the three interventions: 0.14 +/- 0.05, 0.11 +/- 0.03, and 0.11 +/- 0.04 micromol . hour/L for PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, respectively. The time of maximum concentration was delayed for POMxp (2.58 +/- 0.42 hours) compared to PJ (0.65 +/- 0.23 hours) and POMxl (0.94 +/- 0.06 hours). Urolithin-A glucuronide, a urinary metabolite of ellagic acid, was not significantly different with the three interventions, reaching levels of approximately 1,000 ng/mL. This study demonstrates that ellagitannin metabolites, delivered from pomegranate fruits, as PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, reach equivalent levels with a delay in time of maximum concentration of POMxp compared to PJ and POMxl.",1
"A rapid LC/MS/MS quantitation assay for naringin and its two metabolites in rats plasma Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.",1
"Antioxidant properties of raw and processed cabbages To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant activities of cabbages, the amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity and individual phenolic compounds in raw and processed cabbages were determined.

Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids (108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.",1

"Analysis of vervain flavonoids by HPLC/diode array detector method. Its application to quality control A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid fraction. All of the analyzed vervain samples showed a common flavonoid pattern, in which hispidulin and jaceosidin were the major compounds and nepetin was the minor compound.",1

"Trans-resveratrol concentrations in berry skins and wines from grapes grown in Japan The resveratrol concentrations in 10 white, two pink and nine red wines, and in the skins of ripe and apparently healthy grapes of 16 white- and 20 pink- or red-skinned grape varieties grown in Japan (relatively humid and warm with heavy rainfall in the growing season) were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The resveratrol concentration in skins ranged from 0.5 (Pizzutello Bianco) to 14.1 (Mu11er-Thurgau) µg/g fresh skin, with an average of 4.12µg/g for the 36 skin samples, and that in wines from 1 (Delaware) to 244 (Cabernet Sauvignon) µg/L with an average of 81 µg/L for the 21 wine samples. These values are not markedly different from those in the literature pertaining to other grapegrowing and winemaking regions of the world. The average resveratrol concentration in red wines was about six-fold that in white wines. Little resveratrol (less than 0.01 µg/L) was found in grape juices. The effect of fermentation on the skins (maceration) on the resveratrol contents of wines was investigated. While no increase in resveratrol occurred during fermentation without skins, the resveratrol concentrations increased during fermentation on the skins. The rate of resveratrol extraction from skin to wine differed with grape variety and skin contact time.",0
"Antioxidant activity of some foods containing phenolic compounds This study was designed to determine the total phenols (TP) and total antioxidant activity (TAA) of some liquid and solid plant foods that are commonly consumed in Turkey. Total phenols were analysed according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method and antioxidant activities of these compounds in aqueous phase were assessed by measuring their direct ABTS.- radical scavenging abilities. Total phenols varied from 68 to 4162 mg/l for liquid foods and from 735 to 3994 mg/kg for solid foods. TAA of liquid and solid foods ranged between 0.61-6.78 mM and 0.63-8.62 mM, respectively. Total antioxidant activities of foods were well correlated with total phenols (r2 = 0.95). According to content of total phenols per serving, liquid foods were in the order of black tea > instant coffee > coke > red wine > violet carrot juice > apricot nectar > Turkish coffee > grape molasses > sage > white wine > linden flower, and solid foods were in the order of red grape > raisins > tarhana > dried black plum > dried apricot > grape > fresh paprika > fresh black plum > Urtica sp. > cherry > fresh apricot > paprika pickle > paprika paste.",0
"Microwave-assisted extraction of the main phenolic compounds in flaxseed A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time consumption.",0
"Dietary alkylresorcinols and lignans in the Spanish diet: development of the Alignia database The intake of alkylresorcinols and lignans in Spain is unknown due to the lack of information on the content of these compounds in particular foods. This paper describes the development of the first alkylresorcinol and lignan database adapted to the Spanish diet, including foods items especially relevant for this population. The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.",1
"Disposition and metabolism of [2-14C]quercetin-4'-glucoside in rats Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin diglucuronides in the gut, liver, and kidneys and glucuronyl sulfates of methylated quercetin in plasma. The main site of quercetin metabolism seemed to be the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin metabolites may have a major influence on the gut mucosal epithelium and on colonic disease.",1
"Identification and quantitation of ellagic acid in muscadine grape juice Muscadine grape juice will occasionally produce a sediment upon standing for long time periods. In order to seek approaches to elimination of this sediment, it was necessary first to identify it and then to quantitate the material responsible. The sediment was identified through various chemical and spectrophotometric means as ellagic acid. This material could be separated, identified, and quantitated in juice by using HPLC. A simple spectrophotometric assay also sufficed for quantitation. Different juice sources contained highly variable amounts of ellagic acid.",0
"Characterization of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in some cultivars of Ribes, Aronia, and Sambucus and their antioxidant capacity Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.",1
"Nutrients and antioxidant molecules in yellow plums (Prunus domestica L.) from conventional and organic productions: a comparative study Yellow plums (Prunus domestica L) conventionally and organically grown in the same farm were selected to study the influence of different agronomic practices on antioxidant vitamins (ascorbic acid, vitamin E, beta-carotene) and phenolics (total polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonols) concentration. Conventional plums were grown on tilled soil. Three organic cultivations were performed: tilled soil, soil covered with trifolium, and soil covered with natural meadow. Differences in macronutrients were marginal, whereas antioxidant vitamins and phenolic compounds concentration markedly differed among cultivations. Ascorbic acid, alpha-, gamma-tocopherols, and beta-carotene were higher in organic plums grown on soil covered with natural meadow. The highest phenolic acids content was detected in plums grown on soil covered with trifolium. Total polyphenols content was higher in conventional plums. Quercetin was higher in conventional plums, but myrecitin and kaempferol were higher in organic plums. Under the same cultivar and climate conditions, the type of soil management turned out of primary importance in influencing the concentration of health-promoting compounds.",1
"Effect of variety, processing, and storage on the flavonoid glycoside content and composition of lettuce and endive Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive (Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of flavonoids in salads.",1
"Viscous food matrix influences absorption and excretion but not metabolism of blackcurrant anthocyanins in rats The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a simultaneous intake of food and anthocyanins (ACNs) on ACN absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Blackcurrant ACNs (BcACNs) were dissolved in water with or without the addition of oatmeal and orally administered to rats, providing approximately 250 mg total ACNs per kilogram BW. Blood, urine, digesta, and tissue samples of the stomach, jejunum, and colon were subsequently collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 24 h. Identification and quantification of ACNs were carried out by Reversed phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Four major ACNs were present in the blackcurrant extract: delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside. In plasma, the 4 ACNs of blackcurrant were identified and quantified. The time to reach maximal total ACN plasma concentration (C(max) BcACN/water = 0.37 +/- 0.07 micromol/L; C(max) BcACN/oatmeal = 0.20 +/- 0.05 micromol/L) occurred faster after BcACN/water (t(max)= 0.25 h), than after BcACN/oatmeal administration (t(max)= 1.0 h). In digesta and tissue samples, the 4 original blackcurrant ACNs were detected. The relative concentration of rutinosides in the digesta increased during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract, while the glucosides decreased. Maximum ACN excretion in urine occurred later after BcACN/oatmeal than after BcACN/water administration (3 compared with 2 h). The 4 original ACNs of blackcurrant in their unchanged form, as well as several metabolites, were identified in the urine samples of both groups. The simultaneous intake of food affects ACN absorption and excretion in the urine, but not metabolism.",0
"Changes in phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of virgin olive oil during frying The concentration of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA) and its secoiridoid derivatives (3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA) in virgin olive oil decreased rapidly when the oil was repeatedly used for preparing french fries in deep-fat frying operations. At the end of the first frying process (10 min at 180 degrees C), the concentration of the dihydroxyphenol components was reduced to 50-60% of the original value, and after six frying operations only about 10% of the initial components remained. However, tyrosol (p-HPEA) and its derivatives (p-HPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EA) in the oil were much more stable during 12 frying operations. The reduction in their original concentration was much smaller than that for hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives and showed a roughly linear relationship with the number of frying operations. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract measured using the DPPH test rapidly diminished during the first six frying processes, from a total antioxidant activity higher than 740 micromol of Trolox/kg down to less than 250 micromol/kg. On the other hand, the concentration of polar compounds, oxidized triacylglycerol monomers (oxTGs), dimeric TGs, and polymerized TGs rapidly increased from the sixth frying operation onward, when the antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract was very low, and as a consequence the oil was much more susceptible to oxidation. The loss of antioxidant activity in the phenolic fraction due to deep-fat frying was confirmed by the storage oil and oil-in-water emulsions containing added extracts from olive oil used for 12 frying operations.",1
"Metabolism and disposition of resveratrol in rats: extent of absorption, glucuronidation, and enterohepatic recirculation evidenced by a linked-rat model Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide (RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.",1
"Occurrence of resveratrol in edible peanuts Resveratrol has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced cancer risk. This phytoalexin has been reported in a number of plant species, including grapes, and may be one of the compounds responsible for the health benefits of red wine. Analytical methods for measuring resveratrol in wine and peanuts were adapted to isolate, identify, and quantify resveratrol in several cultivars of peanuts. Aqueous ethanol (80% v/v) extracts from peanuts without seed coats were purified over alumina/silica gel columns and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column. Peanuts from each market type, Virginia, runner, and Spanish, produced in four different locations contained from 0.03 to 0.14 microg of resveratrol/g. Seed coats from runner and Virginia types contained approximately 0.65 microg/g of seed coat, which is equivalent to <0.04 microg/seed. Quantitative analysis of 15 cultivars representing 3 peanut market types, which had been cold stored for up to 3 years, indicated a range of 0.02-1.79 microg/g of peanut compared to 0.6-8.0 microg/mL in red wines.",1
"Identification of isoflavone metabolites dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 6'-OH-O-dma, and cis-4-OH-equol in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy using authentic reference compounds The metabolic products of daidzein and genistein, the principal isoflavones of soy, were examined. Six volunteers included soy into their normal diet for a 2-week period and urine samples were analyzed before and after soy consumption. Isolation and characterization of the urinary metabolites were carried out with absorption chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS). The structures of the isoflavones isolated were confirmed by using authentic reference compounds. Dihydrogenistein, 6'-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, and cis-4-OH-equol were identified, in addition to known isoflavonoids daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the known metabolites equol, O-desmethylangolensin, and dihydrodaidzein, by comparing the retention times and the spectra of the urinary compounds with those of the synthesized reference standards. The mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol were also identified. Derivatization of the isoflavones for GC-MS was examined by comparing two silylating reagents, N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and pyridine:hexamethyldisilazan:trimethylchlorosilane (QSM), both used for the derivatization of these compounds. The silylation experiments revealed significant differences in the compositions of the derivatization products. Some corrections were made concerning the earlier published data of dihydrogenistein and 6'-OH-O-dma.",1
"Studies of the in vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones aid in the identification of their urinary metabolites Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones and their hydroxylated analogues 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, 8-OH-daidzein, and 3'-OH-genistein and (2) to characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.",1
"Resveratrol in raw and baked blueberries and bilberries Resveratrol in the fruits of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), the lowbush ""wild"" blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), the rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade), and the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) were measured using a new assay based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS assay provided lower limits of detection than previous methods for resveratrol measurement, 90 fmol of trans-resveratrol injected on-column, and a linear standard curve spanning >3 orders of magnitude. The recoveries of resveratrol from blueberries spiked with 1.8, 3.6, or 36 ng/g were 91.5 +/- 4.5, 95.6 +/- 6.5, and 88.0 +/- 3.6%, respectively. trans-Resveratrol but not cis-resveratrol was detected in both blueberry and bilberry samples. The highest levels of trans-resvertatrol in these specimens were 140.0 +/- 29.9 pmol/g in highbush blueberries from Michigan and 71.0 +/- 15.0 pmol/g in bilberries from Poland. However, considerable regional variation was observed; highbush blueberries from British Columbia contained no detectable resveratrol. Because blueberries and bilberries are often consumed after cooking, the effect of baking on resveratrol content was investigated. After 18 min of heating at 190 degrees C, between 17 and 46% of the resveratrol had degraded in the various Vaccinium species. Therefore, the resveratrol content of baked or heat-processed blueberries or bilberries should be expected to be lower than in the raw fruit. Although blueberries and bilberries were found to contain resveratrol, the level of this chemoprotective compound in these fruits was <10% that reported for grapes. Furthermore, cooking or heat processing of these berries will contribute to the degradation of resveratrol.",1
"Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the isoflavone biochanin A in rats Biochanin A (BCA) is a dietary isoflavone present in legumes, most notably red clover, and in many herbal dietary supplements. BCA has been reported to have chemopreventive properties and is metabolized to the isoflavone genistein (GEN), BCA conjugates, and GEN conjugates. The metabolites may contribute to the chemopreventive effects of BCA. The absorption, metabolism, and disposition of BCA have not been determined in rats. Our objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered BCA by intravenous injection (1 and 5 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal injection (5 and 50 mg/kg), and orally (5 and 50 mg/kg). Plasma and bile samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed in vitro to determine conjugate concentrations for BCA and GEN. Equilibrium dialysis was used to determine protein binding. The BCA and GEN concentrations in plasma, urine, and bile were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters of BCA were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. Significant levels of BCA conjugates and GEN conjugates were detected in plasma and bile. Both BCA and GEN were found to have a high clearance and a large apparent volume of distribution; the bioavailability of both was poor (<4%). Reentry peaks were evident after oral administration of both BCA and GEN, suggesting enterohepatic cycling. The free fraction of BCA in rat plasma was 1.5%. A 2-compartment model that included both linear and nonlinear clearance terms and enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first evaluation of the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats.",0
"Genotype and environmental variation in phenolic content, phenolic acid composition, and antioxidant activity of hard spring wheat The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation observed would delay and/or complicate this process.",0
"Bioavailability of gallic acid and catechins from grape seed polyphenol extract is improved by repeated dosing in rats: implications for treatment in Alzheimer's disease The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid (GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.",1
"Quantitation of polyphenols in different apple varieties Forty-one apple samples, representing eight of the most widely cultivated varieties in western Europe, were collected in Trentino, Italy. Samples were extracted from fresh fruit with a mixture of acetone/water to achieve a good extraction of polyphenols, including proanthocyanidin oligomers which were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC. Up to 20 compounds including catechin, epicatechin, B2 procyanidin, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, anthocyanins, and dihydrochalcones were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and LC-MS. Total polyphenol content was independently measured with an optimized Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The mean content of total polyphenols lay between 66.2 and 211.9 mg/100 g of FW depending on the variety. With chromatographic analysis, it was possible to explain the whole amount of total polyphenols measured by the FC assay. Flavanols (catechin and proanthocyanidins) are the major class of apple polyphenols (71-90%), followed by hydroxycinnamates (4-18%), flavonols (1-11%), dihydrochalcones (2-6%), and in red apples anthocyanins (1-3%).",1
"Urinary excretion of strawberry anthocyanins is dose dependent for physiological oral doses of fresh fruit There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion (Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.",0
"Absorption, tissue distribution and excretion of pelargonidin and its metabolites following oral administration to rats Recent reports have demonstrated various cardiovascular and neurological benefits associated with the consumption of foods rich in anthocyanidins. However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue distribution are only beginning to accumulate. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels reaching 0.5 and 0.15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the overall uptake of the administered pelargonidin was 18 % after 2 h, with the majority of the detected levels located in the stomach. However, the amounts recovered dropped to 1.2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered pelargonidin.",0
"Red chicories as potent scavengers of highly reactive radicals: a study on their phenolic composition and peroxyl radical trapping capacity and efficiency Eight varieties of Cichorium genus vegetables (five heavily red colored, one red spotted, and two fully green) were investigated for their phenolic content (by HPLC and UV-vis spectrophotometry) and for their antioxidant activity. In particular, the capacity (that is, the amount of trapped peroxyl radicals) and the efficiency (that is, the amount of antioxidant necessary to halve the steady-state concentration of peroxyl radicals) were measured. All of the studied chicories are characterized by the presence of a large amount of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, whereas the red color is due to cyanidin glycosides. The presence of these phenolics in red chicories confers to them an exceptionally high peroxyl radical scavenging activity in terms of both capacity and efficiency, particularly in their early stage of growth, and makes this popular and low-cost foods comparable or superior to many foods having well-known antioxidant properties such as red wine, blueberry, and tomato.",0
"Effects of cultivar and processing method on the contents of catechins and procyanidins in grape juice The aim of the presented work was to study the effect of pressing method, pasteurization, cultivar, and vintage on the content of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and nine procyanidins in grape juice. The results showed that the concentration of these flavan-3-ols in the juice was influenced, in decreasing order of importance, by pressing method, cultivar, pasteurization, and vintage. Cold pressing without maceration was the least and hot pressing after maceration at 60 degrees C for 60 min the most effective method for extracting the flavan-3-ols. Pasteurization increased the concentration of catechins in cold-pressed juices, but it decreased concentrations in hot-pressed juices. The concentration of most procyanidins was increased by pasteurization. Among the white cultivars, Seyval and Niagara were highest in procyanidins and Elvira and Chardonnay were highest in catechins. Vincent, Foch, and Baco were the red cultivars highest in catechins, and Vincent also had the highest content of procyanidins.",1
"Flavanone plasma pharmacokinetics from blood orange juice in human subjects Some blood orange juice (BOJ) flavanones may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hypolipidaemic, vasoprotective and anticarcinogenic properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of hesperetin and naringenin in human subjects after BOJ intake. In a cross-over study, seven healthy female volunteers consumed 150 and 300 ml BOJ corresponding to about 51-102 mg hesperetin and to 6-12 mg naringenin, respectively. Plasma samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after BOJ administration and analysed for their content of hesperetin and naringenin by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. The plasma concentrations of these compounds were dose dependent and the peak concentration (Cmax) was reached in 5.1 (sd 0.6) h after BOJ intake. The Cmax of hesperetin was 43.4 (sd 32.4) and 79.8 (sd 60.1) ng/ml after 150 and 300 ml intake, respectively. For naringenin the plasma peak was 16.4 (sd 11.9) and 34.0 (sd 20.6) ng/ml. Moreover, the conjugated forms of these flavanones represent more than 95 % of the plasma concentration. The results indicate that both hesperetin and naringenin are bioavailable after BOJ intake; naringenin seemingly more so than hesperetin.",0
"A dehydrotrimer of ferulic acid from maize bran A new phenolic acid trimer was detected by coupled liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy in alkali extracts of maize bran.

"Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the flavonoid scutellarin in humans after a single oral administration Scutellarin is widely used in treating various cardiovascular diseases. Few data are available regarding its metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. The objectives of this study were to develop methods to identify major metabolites of scutellarin in human urine and plasma and to determine simultaneously the parent drug and its major metabolites in human plasma for pharmacokinetic studies. Four metabolites were detected in urine samples by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS), but only one of them was found in plasma. Its structure was confirmed as scutellarein 6-O-beta-D-glucuronide by MS, NMR, and UV absorbance spectra. The plasma concentrations of scutellarin and the major metabolite were simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. After a single p.o. administration of 60 mg of scutellarin to 20 healthy subjects, the plasma concentrations of scutellarin were very low, and its plasma concentration-time curve was also anomalous. Plasma concentration of the major metabolite was comparatively high, and the peak plasma concentration was 87.0 +/- 29.1 ng/ml. The Tmax was late (7.85 +/- 1.62 h), and part of individual pharmacokinetic profiles showed double peaks, which indicated scutellarin could be absorbed into the intestine after hydrolysis to its aglycone by bacterial enzymes. This was followed by reconjugation in the intestinal cell and/or liver with glucuronic acid catalyzed by the phase II enzyme, which showed regioselectivity and species difference. The regioselectivity of glucuronoconjugation for scutellarin may be of importance for pharmacological activity. Plasma concentration of isoscutellarin can be used as a biomarker of scutellarin intake.",1

"Proanthocyanidin glycosides and related polyphenols from cacao liquor and their antioxidant effects Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.",0
"Determination of piceid and resveratrol in Spanish wines deriving from Monastrell (Vitis vinifera L.) grape variety The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L (average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types of wines.",0
"Development of a rapid method based on solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance detection for the determination of polyphenols in alcohol-free beers An analytical method based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) and followed by liquid chromatographic separation and ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) is proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds which participate on beer stability and sensory properties in alcohol-free beers. Acetonitrile was found to be the most appropriate solvent for the elution of polyphenolic compounds adsorbed on C18 cartridges. The performance of the method was assessed by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.",1
"Optimum domestic processing and cooking methods for reducing polyphenolic (antinutrient) content of pigeon peas Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.",1
"Simultaneous determination of diosmin and diosmetin in human plasma by ion trap liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry: Application to a clinical pharm Diosmetin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone) is the aglycone of the flavonoid glycoside diosmin (3',5,7-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone-7-ramnoglucoside). Diosmin is hydrolyzed by enzymes of intestinal micro flora before absorption of its aglycone diosmetin. A specific, sensitive, precise, accurate and robust HPLC assay for the simultaneous determination of diosmin and diosmetin in human plasma was developed and validated. Plasma samples were incubated with beta-glucuronidase/sulphatase. The analytes were isolated by liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether at pH 2, and separated on a C(18) reversed-phase column using a mixture of methanol/1% formic acid (58:42, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5ml/min. APCI in the positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method was employed. The selected transitions for diosmin, diosmetin and the internal standard (7-ethoxycoumarin) at m/z were: 609.0-->463.0, 301.2-->286.1 and 191, respectively. A good linearity was found in the range of 0.25-500ng/ml (R(2)>0.992) for both compounds. The intra-batch assay precision (CV) for diosmin and diosmetin ranged from 1.5% to 11.2% and from 2.8% to 12.5%, respectively, and the inter-batch precision were from 5.2% to 11.5% and 8.5% to 9.8%, respectively. The accuracy was well within the acceptable range the accuracies (from -2.7% to 4.2% and -1.6% to 3.5% for diosmin and diosmetin, respectively). The mean recoveries of diosmin, diosmetin and the internal standard were 87.5%, 89.2% and 67.2%. Stability studies showed that diosmin and diosmetin were stable in different conditions. Finally, the method was successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of diosmin in healthy volunteers following a single oral administration (Daflon).",1
"Variance of common flavonoids by brand of grapefruit juice Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, respectively.",1

"Quantitation of volatiles and nonvolatile acids in an extract from coffee beverages: correlation with antioxidant activity The antioxidant activities of a commercial brewed coffee were investigated by measuring malonaldehyde (MA) formation from oxidized cod liver oil using a gas chromatographic method (MA-GC assay) and a thiobarbituric acid method (TBA assay). The highest antioxidant activity obtained by the MA-GC assay was from regular whole brewed coffee (97.8%) at a level of 20%, and the highest antioxidant activity obtained by the TBA assay was from decaffeinated whole brewed coffee (96.6%) at a level of 5%. Among 31 chemicals identified in a dichloromethane extract, guaiacol, ethylguaiacol, and vinylguaiacol exhibited antioxidant activities, which were comparable to that of alpha-tocopherol. Among nine chlorogenic acids (three caffeoylquinic acids, three feruloylquinic acids, and three dicaffeoylquinic acids) identified, 5-caffeoylquinic acid contained the greatest amount both in regular (883.5 microg/mL) and in decaffeinated (1032.6 microg/mL) coffees; it exhibited 24.5% activity by the MA-GC assay and 45.3% activity by the TBA assay at a level of 10 microg/mL. Caffeic and ferulic acids showed moderate antioxidant activities in both assays.",1
"Identification and determination of major flavonoids in rat serum by HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS methods following oral administration of Dalbergiaodorifera extract The major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of Dalbergia odorifera extract were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and its coupling to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Utilizing HPLC-MS technique, 18 flavonoids including five isoflavones, four isoflavanones, four neoflavones, two flavanones, two chalcones, one isoflavanonol were identified in free form in serum sample based on comparison with the authentic standards. Furthermore, the amounts of the four prominent flavonoids, (3R)-4'-methoxy-2',3,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, vestitone, formononetin and sativanone were determined in serum by HPLC-UV with internal standard method. The method was validated and utilized in pharmacokinetic studies of these four analytes. This is the first report on identification and determination of the major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of D. odorifera extract and the results provided a firm basis for clarifying the pharmacological effect of D. odorifera and evaluating the clinical applications of this medicinal herb.",0

"Phenolic composition and free radical scavenging activity of different apple varieties in relation to the cultivar, tissue type and storage The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of genotype, tissue type and cold storage on the bioactive compounds content and on the antiradical activity (AA) of different apple cultivars (Golden cl. B, Fuji cl. Kiku8, Braeburn cl. Hillwell). The content of analysed phyto-compounds depended on the clone, on the part of fruit, and to a minor extent, on the storage. For EC(50) data, the cultivar represented the main source of variation and the interaction with the type of tissue, was significant. The AA of apples, measured by means of the DPPH test, was highly correlated to the flavan-3-ols content, which represents a good predictor of the apple antiradical power. The new Braeburn's clone, the Hillwell, had the worst AA related to a minor phyto-chemical content. Also, its phenolic content was dramatically reduced after cold storage (flesh: -50%; peels: -20%; p<0.05). Obtained results underlined the key role of the genotype on the content of the nutraceutical power of apples, which is important to improve their quality and consumption benefits, suggesting to the breeders to pay more attention to the potential healthy compounds in the development of new hybrids.",1

"Capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantitative determination of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol in human urine after olive oil intake Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated antioxidant properties of some virgin olive oil phenolic compounds. One of the prerequisites to extrapolate these data to an in vivo situation is the knowledge of their bioavailability in humans. In the present work we describe an analytical method which enables us to perform hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol quantitative determinations in human urine. This method was successfully used in bioavailability studies of both phenolic compounds after acute olive oil administration. Virgin olive oil was administered to healthy volunteers after a low phenolic diet. The dose administered of both phenolic compounds was estimated in reference to free forms of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol present in virgin olive oil extracts before and after being submitted to hydrolytic conditions. These conditions mimic those occurring during digestion. Urine samples were collected before and after acute olive oil intake and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol urinary recovery increased in response to olive oil administration, obtaining maximal values in the first 4 h. Our results further indicate that hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol are mainly excreted in conjugated form, since only 5.9 +/- 1.4% (hydroxytyrosol) and 13.8 +/- 5.4% (tyrosol) of the total amounts excreted in urine were in free form.",1

"Effect of hydrothermal treatment on the antioxidant properties of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis italica) florets In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and technique used.",1
"Phenolic constituents, furans, and total antioxidant status of distilled spirits The concentrations of 11 phenols and 5 furans were measured in 12 categories of distilled spirits by HPLC methodology, together with the total antioxidant status (TAS) of the same beverages. Ellagic acid was the phenol present in highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.",1
"Bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones in humans: impact of a full-fat yogurt The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released aglycones.",1
"Flavonoid and carbohydrate contents in Tropea red onions: effects of homelike peeling and storage The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions (Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better preserve the onion anthocyanins.",1

"Flavonoids and antioxidant capacity of Georgia-grown Vidalia onions Vidalia onion varieties Nirvana, DPS 1032, Yellow 2025, King-Midas, and SBO 133 grown at Vidalia, Georgia, were analyzed for flavonoid content. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array detection was used for quantification. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation (r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant capacity. The data indicate that Vidalia onions are a rich source of quercetin, and they also contain myricetin and kaempferol.",1
"Cocoa powder enhances the level of antioxidative activity in rat plasma The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin (EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the antioxidative activity of plasma.",1
"Detection of phloridzin in strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) by HPLC-PDA-MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC analysis of the corresponding acyclic 1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.",0
"High-performance thin-layer chromatographic-densitometric determination of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in flaxseed A HPTLC-densitometric method, based on an external standard approach, was developed in order to obtain a novel procedure for routine analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed with a minimum of sample pre-treatment. Optimization of TLC conditions for the densitometric scanning was reached by eluting HPTLC silica gel plates in a horizontal developing chamber. Quantitation of SDG was performed in single beam reflectance mode by using a computer-controlled densitometric scanner and applying a five-point calibration in the 1.00-10.00 microg/spot range. As no sample preparation was required, the proposed HPTLC-densitometric procedure demonstrated to be reliable, yet using an external standard approach. The proposed method is precise, reproducible and accurate and can be employed profitably in place of HPLC for the determination of SDG in complex matrices.",0
"Phenolic and volatile compounds of extra virgin olive oil (Olea europaea L. cv. Cornicabra) with regard to fruit ripening and irrigation management This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August (RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied to the olive orchard.",1
"Metabolomics provide new insight on the metabolism of dietary phytochemicals in rats Foods of plant origin contain a large number of phytochemicals that may positively affect health. Phytochemicals are largely excreted in urine as metabolites that are formed in host tissues or by the microbiota and constitute a great proportion of the urinary metabolome. The latter can be characterized by a metabolomics approach. In this work, we compared the metabolism of lignins to that of the structurally related ferulic acid (FA) and sinapic acid (SA). Five groups of rats (n = 5) were fed for 2 d a purified diet alone [control (C)] or supplemented with lignin-enriched wheat bran (3% of the diet, wt:wt), poplar wood lignins (0.42%), FA (0.42%), or SA (0.42%). The metabolomes of urine samples collected after 1 and 2 d of supplementation were analyzed by high-resolution MS (liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight). Comparing metabolic fingerprints by gathering semiquantitative information on several hundreds of metabolites and using multivariate statistical analysis (partial least squares for discriminant analysis) showed the similarity between both lignin-supplemented and C groups and confirmed that lignins are largely inert and not absorbed in the body. One the other hand, metabolic fingerprints of the 2 phenolic acid-supplemented groups were clearly distinct from the C group. Differences between the groups were mainly from nonmetabolized FA and SA and metabolites excreted in urine. Thirteen of them were identified as sulfate esters and glucuronide and glycine conjugates of the same phenolic acids, and of dihydrosinapic, vanillic, and benzoic acids. This study shows that metabolomics allows the identification of new metabolites of phytochemicals and can be used to distinguish individuals fed different phytochemical-containing foods.",0

"Possible role of plant phenolics in the production of trichothecenes by Fusarium graminearum strains on different fractions of maize kernels Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.",0
"trans-Resveratrol content in commercial peanuts and peanut products A modified high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for determination of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) in peanuts and peanut products has been developed. Resveratrol was extracted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v) by blending with diatomaceous earth at high speed followed by purification of an aliquot of the extract on a minicolumn packed with Al(2)O(3)-ODS (C(18)) mixture. The column was eluted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v), eluate was evaporated under nitrogen, and residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase. Resveratrol in an aliquot of purified extract was quantitated by HPLC on silica gel with n-hexane-2-propanol-water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (1050/270/17/5/1, v/v) as a mobile phase. The recovery of resveratrol added to diatomaceous earth at 0.05 microg/g was 98.95 +/- 17.79%; the recovery of the standard added to fresh peanuts (with 0.070 microg/g natural level of resveratrol) at 0.50, 5.00, and 10.00 microg/g was 117.23 +/- 8.87, 100.10 +/- 2.49, and 100.45 +/- 1.51%, respectively. The quantitation limit of resveratrol in fresh peanuts was about 0. 01 microg/g. Roasted peanuts had the lowest content of resveratrol of 0.055 +/- 0.023 microg/g (n = 21), while in peanut butter its concentration was significantly higher, 0.324 +/- 0.129 microg/g (n = 46), and boiled peanuts had the highest level of 5.138 +/- 2.849 microg/g (n = 12). Resveratrol content in commercial peanut products was similar to the resveratrol content of the raw peanut fractions routinely used for making them.",1
"Content of phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers in 17 rye (Secale cerealeL.) varieties The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The content in sinapic acid ranged from 70 to 140 microgram g(-1) dry matter, p-coumaric acid ranged from 40 to 70 microgram g(-1) dry matter, and caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and vanillic acids were all detected in concentrations less than 20 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA (40-70 microgram g(-1) dry matter), and 8,5 -DiFA (20-40 microgram g(-1) dry matter).",1
"Processing and storage effects on monomeric anthocyanins, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity of processed blackberry products Blackberries are a rich source of polyphenolics, particularly anthocyanins, that may contribute to the reduced risk of chronic disease; however, as with most berries, the fresh fruit are only seasonally available. With most of the blackberries consumed as frozen or in thermally processed forms after long-term storage, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing and 6 months of storage on the anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity of blackberries that were individually quick-frozen (IQF), canned-in-syrup, canned-in-water, pureed, and juiced (clarified and nonclarified). Monomeric anthocyanins, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC FL) and photochemiluminescence (PCL) were determined postprocessing (1 day) and after 1, 3, and 6 months of storage. Processing resulted in increases in polymeric color values (up to 7%) and losses in monomeric anthocyanins (up to 65%). For most products, processing also resulted in losses in antioxidant capacity (by ORAC FL and PCL). Storage at 25 degrees C of all processed products resulted in dramatic losses in monomeric anthocyanins with as much as 75% losses of anthocyanins throughout storage, which coincided with marked increases of percent polymeric color values of these products over 6 months of storage. There were no changes in ORAC FL or PCL for processed products throughout long-term storage. No significant changes in antioxidant capacity or anthocyanin content were observed in IQF fruit during long-term storage at -20 degrees C.",0
"Genotype and environmental variation in phenolic content, phenolic acid composition, and antioxidant activity of hard spring wheat The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation observed would delay and/or complicate this process.",1
"Urinary composition and postprandial blood changes in H-secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) metabolites in rats do not differ between acute and chronic SDG treatments Although chronic exposure to secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) was shown to alter (3)H-SDG metabolite disposition in rats, the proportion of measured radioactivity attributed to known or unknown SDG metabolites was not determined. Using HPLC and GC-MS, two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of acute (1 d) vs. chronic (10 d) SDG treatment on major urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG in female, Sprague-Dawley rats (70-72-d-old) over a 48-h period and if new urinary metabolites were detectable in rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG. A third experiment was conducted to determine changes in postprandial blood levels of (3)H-SDG metabolites over a 24-h period with acute or chronic SDG treatment. Regardless of treatment, enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol accounted for 75-80% of urine radioactivity. Four potential new lignan metabolites, two of which were detected in the urine of rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG, were found. Type of treatment had no effect on levels of individual urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG. As observed for plasma lignans in women fed flaxseed, blood radioactivity peaked at 9 h and remained high until 24 h in both treatment groups, suggesting that blood lignan kinetics might be similar with flaxseed or SDG consumption and that they were comparable between humans and rats. In conclusion, the main urinary lignan metabolites were enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol. Urinary composition or blood levels of radioactive lignans were not affected by the duration of SDG exposure. Thus, while chronic SDG exposure alters lignan disposition in rats, it does not change the metabolite profile.",1
"Quantification of a broad spectrum of lignans in cereals, oilseeds, and nuts Twenty-four plant lignans were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in bran extracts of 16 cereal species, in four nut species, and in two oilseed species (sesame seeds and linseeds). Eighteen of these were lignans previously unidentified in these species, and of these, 16 were identified in the analyzed samples. Four different extraction methods were applied as follows: alkaline extraction, mild acid extraction, a combination of alkaline and mild acid extraction, or accelerated solvent extraction. The extraction method was of great importance for the lignan yield. 7-Hydroxymatairesinol, which has not previously been detected in cereals because of destructive extraction methods, was the dominant lignan in wheat, triticale, oat, barley, millet, corn bran, and amaranth whole grain. Syringaresinol was the other dominant cereal lignan. Wheat and rye bran had the highest lignan content of all cereals; however, linseeds and sesame seeds were by far the most lignan-rich of the studied species.",1
"Extended glucuronidation is another major path of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.",1
"Analysis of theaflavins in biological fluids using liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.",0

"Content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic acid compounds in conjunction with the antioxidant capacity for a variety of northwest Vaccinium berries This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present within these Vaccinium species.",1
"Phytochemicals and antioxidant activity of milled fractions of different wheat varieties The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher (p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions (1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was >80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.",0
"Improved HPLC method for the determination of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin Commercially available curcumin, a bright orange-yellow color pigment of turmeric, consists of a mixture of three curcuminoids, namely, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. These were isolated by column chromatography and identified by spectroscopic studies. The purity of the curcuminoids was analyzed by an improved HPLC method. HPLC separation was performed on a C(18) column using three solvents, methanol, 2% AcOH, and acetonitrile, with detection at 425 nm. Four different commercially available varieties of turmeric, namely, Salem, Erode, Balasore, and local market samples, were analyzed to detect the percentage of these three curcuminoids. The percentages of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin as estimated using their calibration curves were found to be 1.06 +/- 0.061 to 5.65 +/- 0.040, 0.83 +/- 0.047 to 3.36 +/- 0.040, and 0.42 +/- 0.036 to 2.16 +/- 0.06, respectively, in four different samples.

"Characterization and quantitation of antioxidant constituents of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.",0

"Thermal Processing Enhances the Nutritional Value of Tomatoes by Increasing Total Antioxidant Activity Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed < 0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 +/- 0.03 micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the vitamin C content significantly dropped to 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.01, and 0.54 +/- 0.02 micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the trans-lycopene content had increased to 3.11+/- 0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 +/- 0.36 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 degrees C for 2, 15, and 30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 +/- 0.26, 5.53 +/- 0.24, and 6.70 +/- 0.25 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of chronic diseases.",1
"Daidzein and genistein concentrations in human milk after soy consumption Soy isoflavones were quantified from human milk by a fast, precise, and selective HPLC method after enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated isoflavones and extraction with ethyl acetate. Isoflavone aglycones and their mammalian metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin were separated selectively and identified by absorbance patterns, fluorometric and electrochemical detection, gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis after trimethylsilylation, and with internal and external authentic standards. HPLC injections of 20 microL of human milk showed detection limits of 1-3 pmol for all analytes by using diode-array detection. The detection limit could be improved by as much as 1000-fold by extended concentration through partitioning with ethyl acetate, by using electrochemical detection, by increasing the injection volumes, or by combining these techniques. We used the proposed method to monitor isoflavone concentrations in human milk and in human urine after challenge with 5, 10, and 20 g of roasted soybeans in the diet. Implications of the results for the potential of isoflavones to prevent cancer in newborn infants exposed to these agents are discussed.",1

"Determination of isoflavones in soybean food and human urine using liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) was developed for the determination of isoflavones. Electrochemical behaviour of daidzein and genistein was studied on carbon paste electrode (CPE) by adsorptive transfer stripping square wave voltammetry. The obtained electrochemical results were used for the development of HPLC-ED method. Furthermore, isoflavones were separated on an Atlantis dC18 column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.15M acetate buffer of pH 5.5 (solvent B) at a flow rate 0.4 mL/min. A linear gradient profile (solvent B) was at 0-2 min 87%; 22 min 60%; 27 min 50%; 31 min 45%; 47 min 87%. Full scan of multi-channel coulometric detection was tested and optimal potential at 450 mV was chosen for our purposes. Calibration curves were linear (daidzein R(2) = 0.9993 and genistein R(2) = 0.9987). The detection limit for daidzein/genistein was 480/394 pg/mL (1.8/1.5 nM) and per column 2.4/1.9 pg.

"Phenolic acid profiles in some small berries The composition of phenolic acids in several small berries grown in Northeastern Poland, namely, low-bush blueberries, black mulberries, European juneberries, black currants, fruits of blue-berried honeysuckle, and blackberries, was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The total content of phenolic acids, identified by GC-MS, ranged from 2845.8 +/- 141.0 (black mulberries) to 5418.2 +/- 228.0 (blue-berried honeysuckle). Twenty phenolic acids were identified in the berries. Of these, hydroxycaffeic, m- and p-coumaric, and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acids were the major phenolic acids in blackberries and blueberries, m-coumaric acid was the major phenolic acid in blue-berried honeysuckle and black currant fruits, while salicylic, caffeic, and m- and p-coumaric acids were the predominant phenolic acids in European juneberries. Syringic and veratric acids were detected only in blueberries, while p-hydroxybenzoic and sinapic acids were present only in black currants and o-coumaric acid was present in blueberries and black mulberries. The phenolic acids liberated from esters and glycosidic bonds were the major fractions of phenolic acids in the berries.",1
"Biophenols in table olives Unprocessed olives are well-known sources of phenolic antioxidants with important biological properties. Processing methods to prepare table olives may cause a reduction of valuable phenols and may deprive the food of precious biological functions. The present work was undertaken to evaluate table olives produced in Greece as sources of biophenols. Commercially available olives were analyzed for their total phenol content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and for individual phenols by RP-HPLC. Samples were Spanish-style green olives in brine, Greek-style naturally black olives in brine, and Kalamata olives in brine. Most of the types of olives analyzed were found to be good sources of phenols. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and luteolin were the prevailing phenols in almost all of the samples examined. High levels of hydroxytyrosol were determined mainly in Kalamata olives and Spanish-style green olives, cultivar Chalkidiki (250-760 mg/kg).",1

Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS.

"Polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity in strawberry purees  impact of achene level and storage In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.",1

"Changes occurring in phenolic compounds and alpha-tocopherol of virgin olive oil during storage Changes occurring in the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, and complex phenols linked to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol (fractions FII and FIV) and p-hydroxyphenylethanol (FIII) during storage of virgin olive oil under environmental conditions were studied. Under diffused light, alpha-tocopherol was decomposed by 79% in 4 months, whereas <45% of the phenols were lost during the same period. Among the phenols, FII showed the least stability, and decreased by 72% in 6 months. Total phenols, FIII, and FIV recorded reductions in the range of 57-63% in 6 months. When the oil was stored in the dark, alpha-tocopherol, total phenols, FIII, and FIV exhibited similar profiles of degradation, reducing by 39-45% in the first 6 months and 50-62% in 12 months. FII was the least stable compound in the dark and recorded a loss of 64% in 6 months and 79% in 12 months. The levels of the above antioxidants were further related to peroxide formation. Remaining levels of these compounds at PV = 20 meq/kg ranged between 50 and 73% under diffused light and between 40 and 62% in the dark.",1
"Hydroxytyrosol 4-b-D-glucoside, an important phenolic compound in olive fruits and derived products There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside (4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol [(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these products.",0

"Aglycones and sugar moieties alter anthocyanin absorption and metabolism after berry consumption in weanling pigs To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight (BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and metabolism of ACNs.",1
"HPLC analysis of isoflavonoids and other phenolic agents from foods and from human fluids A fast, precise and selective diode array HPLC method is presented for the extraction and analysis of soy isoflavonoids from foods and from human urine, plasma, and breast milk in support of mechanistic and epidemiologic studies assessing the potential cancer protective role of soya or isoflavones. Solid phase or solvent extraction was chosen for isolation, and enzymatic or acid hydrolysis procedures were used for aglycone production depending on the matrix to be analyzed. C-18 reversed-phase HPLC was applied to selectively separate and quantitate daidzein (1), glycitein (3), and genistein (4), including their malonyl (a) and acetyl (b) esters, and their mammalian metabolites equol (6) and O-desmethylangolensin (7), as well as formononetin (2), biochanin-A (5), and coumestrol (8) using a gradient elution system. UV absorbance scans and authentic standards were applied for identification purposes, additional to fluorometric monitoring, electrochemical detection, and GC/ MS analysis after trimethyl silylation. Detection limits of 20-microl injections were found to be 1.09, 0.53, 3.28, and 1.00 pmoles for daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin (DMA), respectively, by monitoring at the individual compound's absorption maximum. The proposed method was applied to monitor isoflavone levels in soy foods and in human plasma, urine and breast milk after challenge with roasted soybeans. Implications of the presented results on the potential activity of isoflavones to prevent cancer by exposing newborn infants to these agents are discussed.",1
"Occurrence of resveratrol in edible peanuts Resveratrol has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced cancer risk. This phytoalexin has been reported in a number of plant species, including grapes, and may be one of the compounds responsible for the health benefits of red wine. Analytical methods for measuring resveratrol in wine and peanuts were adapted to isolate, identify, and quantify resveratrol in several cultivars of peanuts. Aqueous ethanol (80% v/v) extracts from peanuts without seed coats were purified over alumina/silica gel columns and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column. Peanuts from each market type, Virginia, runner, and Spanish, produced in four different locations contained from 0.03 to 0.14 microg of resveratrol/g. Seed coats from runner and Virginia types contained approximately 0.65 microg/g of seed coat, which is equivalent to <0.04 microg/seed. Quantitative analysis of 15 cultivars representing 3 peanut market types, which had been cold stored for up to 3 years, indicated a range of 0.02-1.79 microg/g of peanut compared to 0.6-8.0 microg/mL in red wines.",0
"Absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside in rats Anthocyanins, kind of flavonoids (FL) found in plants and vegetables, are known to have varieties of physiological functions. In the present study, we examined absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (Dp3G) in rats. Dp3G appeared in the plasma at 15 min after oral administration as an intact glucosidic form. The plasma level also showed another peak at 60 min. One metabolite peak was detected in the plasma and the structure was assigned as 4'-O-methyl Dp3G (MDp3G) by NMR and MS. The metabolite was also identified in several tissues as a major metabolite especially in the liver. No 3'-O-methyl Dp3G was detected in any tissues, therefore, 4'-OH methylation is the main path of Dp3G metabolism in rats. This finding generalized the metabolic formation of FL having pyrogallol B ring because it has been reported that FL having catechol structure produced 3'-O-methyl-derivatives, but FL having pyrogallol structure produced 4'-O-methyl-derivatives.",1
"effect of dose size on bioavailability of acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins from red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. Var. capitata) Recent studies indicate that anthocyanin intake conveys a variety of health benefits, which depend on absorption and metabolic mechanisms that deliver anthocyanins and their bioactive metabolites to responsive tissues. The anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red cabbage (containing 1.38 micromol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated and methylated anthocyanins. The results show that red cabbage anthocyanins were excreted in both intact and metabolized forms and that recovery of nonacylated anthocyanins in urine was >4-fold that of acylated anthocyanins.",1
"Metabolism of dietary procyanidins in rats Procyanidins are major dietary polyphenols made of elementary flavan-3-ol (epi)catechin units. They have antioxidant properties and may contribute to health benefits in humans, but little is known about their metabolic fate. We compared here the metabolism of procyanidin dimer B3, trimer C2, and polymer isolated from willow tree catkins to that of catechin monomer in rats. These compounds were administered in the rat diet (0.1%, w/w) for 5 d and their metabolites estimated in 24 h urine. In rats fed procyanidins, neither parent compound nor catechin derivatives could be detected in contrast to animals fed catechin monomer, which excreted large amounts of catechin and its 3'-O-methylated form (25.7 +/- 0.6%). On the other hand, 16 metabolites of microbial origin were detected and identified as phenylvaleric, phenylpropionic, phenylacetic, and benzoic acid derivatives. Their total yields significantly decreased from the catechin monomer (10.6 +/- 1.1%) to the procyanidin dimer (6.5 +/- 0.2%), trimer (0.7 +/- 0.1%), and polymer (0.5 +/- 0.1%). Therefore, the degree of procyanidin polymerization has a major impact on their fate in the body characterized by a poor absorption through the gut barrier and a limited metabolism by the intestinal microflora as compared to catechin. This will have to be considered to explain the health effects of procyanidins. The contribution of their microbial metabolites should also be further investigated.",1
"Phenolic profile of quince fruit (Cydonia oblonga Miller) (pulp and peel) Qualitative and quantitative analyses of phenolic compounds were carried out on quince fruit samples from seven different geographical origins in Portugal. For each origin, both pulp and peel were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD and HPLC-DAD/MS. The results revealed differences between the phenolic profiles of pulps and peels in all studied cases. The pulps contained mainly caffeoylquinic acids (3-, 4-, and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acids and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid) and one quercetin glycoside, rutin (in low amount). The peels presented the same caffeoylquinic acids and several flavonol glycosides: quercetin 3-galactoside, kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-rutinoside, and several unidentified compounds (probably kaempferol glycoside and quercetin and kaempferol glycosides acylated with p-coumaric acid). The highest content of phenolics was found in peels.",1
"Extraction of rutin from buckwheat (Fagopyrum escuentum Moench) seeds and determination by capillary electrophoresis The content of the flavonoid rutin was determined in different milling fractions of buckwheat seeds and in buckwheat stems, leaves, and flowers. The extraction was performed by using a solvent containing 60% of ethanol and 5% of ammonia in water. The extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (running buffer of 50 mM borate (pH 9.3), 100 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate; determination at 380 nm). In bran fractions the concentration of rutin was 131-476 ppm, and in flour fractions 19-168 ppm. On average, about 300, 1000, and 46000 ppm of rutin were found in leaves, stems, and flowers, respectively. The results indicate that buckwheat could be an important nutritional source of flavonoids, especially in countries with a low mean daily flavonoid intake.",1
"Pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in healthy volunteers fed freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 7 days Eleven subjects completed a clinical trial to determine the safety/tolerability of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) and to measure, in plasma and urine, specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.",1
"Phenolic profiles of raw apricots, pumpkins, and their purees in the evaluation of apricot nectar and jam authenticity The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.",0

"Retention and changes of soy isoflavones and carotenoids in immature soybean seeds (Edamame) during processing Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed development.",1

"Literature data may underestimate the actual antioxidant capacity of cereals Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.",1
"Spectrophotometric and coulometric detection in the high-performance liquid chromatography of flavonoids and optimization of sample treatment for the determination of quercetin in orange juice The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.",1

"Determination of total content of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity in vegetables - evaluation of spectrophotometric methods This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods (catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.",0
"Metabolism and disposition of resveratrol in rats: extent of absorption, glucuronidation, and enterohepatic recirculation evidenced by a linked-rat model Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide (RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.",0

"Effect of domestic cooking on human bioavailability of naringenin, chlorogenic acid, lycopene and beta-carotene in cherry tomatoes Epidemiological data showed that tomato and tomato product (sauce, paste) consumption is associated with a protective effect against the development of some chronic-degenerative diseases. Tomato antioxidant bioactive molecules such as carotenoids and polyphenols could be responsible, at least in part, for the healthy effect observed. The bioavailability of these compounds is an essential requirement to sustain their in vivo role. While it is well known that many factors can influence the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the food matrix, there is little information about the factors affecting phenolic compounds' bioaccessibility.",1
"Analysis of urinary metabolites of tea catechins by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry Tea has been proposed to have beneficial health effects which have been attributed to the polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. The bioavailability and biotransformation of these compounds, however, are not clearly understood. In this study, we used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to determine urinary glucuronidated and sulfated tea catechins and their metabolites (including methylated and ring-fission metabolites) based on the detection of deprotonated molecular ions and aglycone fragment ions. The compound resolution was achieved both chromatographically and mass spectroscopically. After green tea administration, the major conjugates appeared in human, mouse, and rat urine samples were identified as monoglucuronides and monosulfates of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin. We also found O-methyl-EGC-O-glucuronides and -O-sulfates and O-methyl-epicatechin-O-sulfates in human urine. (-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), the ring-fission metabolites of EGC and (-)-epicatechin, respectively, were also predominantly in monoglucuronide and monosulfate forms in the urine. In comparison to rats, the urinary metabolite profiles of tea catechins in mice resemble more closely to those in humans. This is the first report describing direct simultaneous analysis of multiple tea catechin conjugates in urine samples. This method will allow more thorough investigations of the biotransformation of tea polyphenols.",1
"Oxidative metabolites of the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone in rat bile and urine Recent studies have shown that the mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) are biotransformed in vitro by hepatic microsomes from rats and humans to various metabolites carrying one additional hydroxy group either at the aromatic or at the aliphatic moiety. To clarify whether these metabolites are also formed in vivo, each lignan was administered intraduodenally at a dose of 10 mg/kg of bw to bile duct-catheterized female Wistar rats and the 6 h bile analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. With END-dosed rats, three products of aromatic and two of aliphatic monohydroxylation were found, whereas six aromatic and five aliphatic monohydroxylated biliary metabolites were detected after administration of ENL. The metabolites hydroxylated at the aromatic rings were unequivocally identified by comparison with synthetic reference compounds. The structures of the in vivo metabolites arising from aliphatic hydroxylation could not be completely elucidated; they were identical with some of the formerly reported microsomal products according to GC retention times and mass spectra. Significant amounts of most of the metabolites of the mammalian lignans identified in bile were also found in the urine of female rats after oral administration of 10 mg/kg of bw END or ENL and in the urine of female and male Wistar rats after they had been fed a diet containing 5% flaxseed. Thus, the mammalian lignans END and ENL give rise to several hydroxylated metabolites in vivo, which may contribute to the biological effects of these important food constituents.",1
"Effect of Thermal and High-Pressure Processing on the Nutritional Value and Quality Attributes of a Nectarine Puree with Industrial Origin during the Refrigerated Storage The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine (Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity optimization.",1

"Absorption and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin after administration of different levels of cocoa powder or (-)-epicatechin in rats (-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.",1
"Fast separation and determination of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and other phenolic compounds in extra-virgin olive oil by capillary zone electrophoresis with ultraviolet-diode array detection Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.",1
"Inhibition of cancer growth by resveratrol is related to its low bioavailability The relationship between resveratrol (RES) bioavalability and its effect on tumor growth was investigated. Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and oral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. Half-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., was very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in plasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in mice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the first 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, and kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g fresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least 99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol of t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver can remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by t-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was found in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M cells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral administration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking water at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of mice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased hepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The antimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).",1
"Phytoestrogen content of cereals and cereal-based foods consumed in the UK Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, there is little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary phytoestrogens in the UK. These results will allow a more accurate estimation of exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.",1
"Different profiles of quercetin metabolites in rat plasma: comparison of two administration methods The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.",0
"Novel approach to the detection and quantification of phenolic compounds in olive oil based on 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 31P NMR spectroscopy has been employed to detect and quantify phenolic compounds in the polar fraction of virgin olive oil. This novel analytical method is based on the derivatization of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of phenolic compounds with 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyldioxaphospholane and the identification of the phosphitylated compounds on the basis of the 31P chemical shifts. Quantification of a large number of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil can be accomplished by integration of the appropriate signals in the 31P NMR spectrum and the use of the phosphitylated cyclohexanol as internal standard. Finally, the validity of this technique for quantitative measurements was thoroughly examined.",1
"No effect of the farming system (organic/conventional) on the bioavailability of apple (Malus domestica Bork., cultivar Golden Delicious) polyphenols in healthy men: a comparative study The organic food sales have been increasing during the recent years.

However, data on the bioavailability of phytochemicals from organically or conventionally produced plant foods are scarce.",1
"Separation, characterization and quantitation of benzoic and phenolic antioxidants in American cranberry fruit by GC-MS A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids (benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric (0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free acid.",1
"Tissue distribution of anthocyanins in rats fed a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of anthocyanins to various organs (bladder, prostate, testes, heart and adipose tissue) in rats fed with a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 days. Identification and quantification of anthocyanins were carried out by HPLC-DAD. The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins (native anthocyanins and their metabolites) was low (0.20 +/- 0.03%, n = 8). Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives (methylated anthocyanins and glucurono-conjugated derivatives) differed according to the organ considered. The bladder contained the highest levels of anthocyanins followed by the prostate. Prostate, testes and heart contained native cyanidin 3-glucoside and a small proportion of cyanidin monoglucuronide. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and methylated derivatives were present in adipose tissue. Thus, anthocyanin feeding in rats resulted in a wide distribution of anthocyanin derivatives to several organs. Identification of target tissues of anthocyanins may then help to understand the mechanisms of action of anthocyanins in vivo.",1
"Infusions of Portuguese medicinal plants: dependence of final antioxidant capacity and phenol content on extraction features Aqueous extracts of most medicinal plants traditionally employed in Portugal (at the ratio of 1 g plant: 110 mL water) have been assayed for total antioxidant capacity and phenol content, in order to elucidate their claimed medicinal features.",0
"An LC-MS method to determine concentrations of isoflavones and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates in urine Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in biological fluids.",0
"Germplasm characterization of Zolfino landraces (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by flavonoid content The flavonoid composition of three phenotypes of ""Zolfino"" landraces, a typical bean grown in Tuscany, has been elucidated by means of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analysis. Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a nutritional point of view.",0
"Sterol ferulates, sterols, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinols from wheat, rye, and corn bran oils and their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus activation Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate (5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol (10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol (19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- (14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4, and 11, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction.",1
"Identification and antioxidant activity of flavonoid metabolites in plasma and urine of eriocitrin-treated rats Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.",0
"Determination of matairesinol in flax seed by HPLC with coulometric electrode array detection A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on +150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.",1
"Determination of isoflavones in soy and selected foods containing soy by extraction, saponification, and liquid chromatography: Collaborative study Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone values of 47-3099 microg/g.",0

"Anthocyanin metabolites in human urine and serum In the present study we investigated the metabolic conversion of cyanidin glycosides in human subjects using solid-phase extraction,HPLC-diode array detector, MS, GC, and enzymic techniques. Volunteers consumed approximately 20 g chokeberry extract containing 1.3 g cyanidin 3-glycosides (899 mg cyanidin 3-galactoside, 321 mg cyanidin 3-arabinoside, 51 mg cyanidin 3-xyloside and 50 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h post-consumption of the extract. Urine samples were also collected at 0, 4-5,and 22-24h. We have confirmed that human subjects have the capacity to metabolise cyanidin 3-glycosides, as we observed at least ten individual anthocyanin metabolites in the urine and serum. Average concentrations of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites in the urine reached levels of 17.9 (range 14.9-20.9) l.mol/l within 5 h post-consumption and persisted in 24h urine samples at levels of 12.1 (range 11.1-13.0) nmol/l. In addition, average total levels of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites detected in the serum were observed at 5917 (range 197.3-986.1) nmol/ within 2h post-consumption. Cyanidin 3-galactoside accounted for 55.4% (9.9(range 7-2-12-6) l.mol/) and 66.0% (390.6 (range 119.4-661-9) nmol V) of the detected anthocyanins in the urine and serum samples,respectively. The metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates, as well as methylated and oxidised derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and cyanidin glucuronide. Conjugation probably affects the biological activity of anthocyanins and these metabolic products are likely in part responsible for the reported health benefits associated with the consumption of anthocyanins.",1
"Effect of drying conditions and storage period on polyphenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and ascorbic acid of prunes In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.",1
"Thermal Treatment of Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) Increases the Antioxidant Content and the Inhibitory Effect on Human Neutrophil Burst The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts from human neutrophils in the presence of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of eggplants.",1
"Determination of lignans and isoflavonoids in human female plasma following dietary supplementation Plasma levels of the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone, and also the isoflavonic phyto-oestrogens daidzein, equol and genistein, are reported for postmenopausal Australian women consuming a traditional diet supplemented with linseed, soya flour or clover sprouts. Analysis was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, after enzymatic hydrolysis and ion-exchange chromatography. Following linseed supplementation, combined levels of enterolactone and enterodiol reached 500 ng/ml, whereas after soya flour or clover sprouts the respective concentrations of equol, daidzein and genistein reached 43, 312 and 148 ng/ml. Not all subjects were able to produce equol from daidzein. The possible relationship and role of these weak dietary oestrogens as restraining factors in the development of hormone-dependent cancers in Asian populations is discussed.",1
"Absorption of acylated anthocyanins in rats and humans after ingesting an extract of Ipomoea batatas purple sweet potato tuber We evaluated the absorbability of anthocyanins in humans and rats administered with a beverage prepared from an extract of the tuber of purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Cultivar Ayamurasaki), or with an anthocyanin concentrate. Two major anthocyanin components, cyanidin 3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside) and peonidin 3-O-(2-O-(6-O-(E)-caffeoyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside)-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside), were detected in the plasma and urine of both rats and humans by HPLC or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The plasma concentration of anthocyanins in humans reached a maximum 90 minutes after ingestion, and the recovery of anthocyanins in the urine was estimated as 0.01-0.03%. These results indicate that acylated anthocyanins could be selectively absorbed after ingesting food.",1

"Quantitation of volatiles and nonvolatile acids in an extract from coffee beverages: correlation with antioxidant activity The antioxidant activities of a commercial brewed coffee were investigated by measuring malonaldehyde (MA) formation from oxidized cod liver oil using a gas chromatographic method (MA-GC assay) and a thiobarbituric acid method (TBA assay). The highest antioxidant activity obtained by the MA-GC assay was from regular whole brewed coffee (97.8%) at a level of 20%, and the highest antioxidant activity obtained by the TBA assay was from decaffeinated whole brewed coffee (96.6%) at a level of 5%. Among 31 chemicals identified in a dichloromethane extract, guaiacol, ethylguaiacol, and vinylguaiacol exhibited antioxidant activities, which were comparable to that of alpha-tocopherol. Among nine chlorogenic acids (three caffeoylquinic acids, three feruloylquinic acids, and three dicaffeoylquinic acids) identified, 5-caffeoylquinic acid contained the greatest amount both in regular (883.5 microg/mL) and in decaffeinated (1032.6 microg/mL) coffees; it exhibited 24.5% activity by the MA-GC assay and 45.3% activity by the TBA assay at a level of 10 microg/mL. Caffeic and ferulic acids showed moderate antioxidant activities in both assays.",0

"Antioxidant capacity, vitamin C, phenolics, and anthocyanins after fresh storage of small fruits Fresh strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), raspberries (Rubus idaeus Michx.), highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were stored at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C for up to 8 days to determine the effects of storage temperature on whole fruit antioxidant capacity (as measured by the oxygen radical absorbing capacity assay, Cao et al., Clin. Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.",1
"Phase II-Inducing, Polyphenols Content and Antioxidant Capacity of Corn (Zea mays L.) from Phenotypes of White, Blue, Red and Purple Colors Processed into Masa and Tortillas White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching (PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and capacity to induce QR.",0
"Rapid tests to assess the antioxidant activity of Phaseolus vulgaris L. dry beans The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional food.",1
"Content of free phenolic compounds in cultivars of potatoes harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands) Determination of free phenolic compounds in potato samples was optimized using a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line diode array detection. This method was applied to samples of four cultivars of potatoes harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between (+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.",0
"Anti-inflammatory properties of a pomegranate extract and its metabolite urolithin-A in a colitis rat model and the effect of colon inflammation on phenolic metabolism Whether the beneficial effects of pomegranate are due to the ellagitannins or to their microbiota-derived urolithins is not known. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of pomegranate intake and its main microbiota-derived metabolite urolithin-A (UROA) on colon inflammation and to assess whether UROA is the main anti-inflammatory compound. In addition, the effect of the inflammation on the phenolic metabolism was also explored. Male Fisher rats were fed with 250 mg kg(-1) day(-1) pomegranate extract (PE) or 15 mg kg(-1) day(-1) UROA for 25 days. Dextran sodium sulfate (5%) (DSS) was administered for the five last days and then rats were euthanized. DSS is a well-known model of inflammatory bowel disease. Colon tissue damage, microbiota changes, antioxidant status, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), nitric oxide production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), gene expression (microarrays and RT-PCR) and polyphenol metabolism (LC-MS-MS) were evaluated. Both PE and UROA decreased inflammation markers (iNOS, cycloxygenase-2, PTGES and PGE(2) in colonic mucosa) and modulated favorably the gut microbiota. The G(1) to S cell cycle pathway was up-regulated in both groups. UROA group showed various down-regulated pathways, including that of the inflammatory response. PE, but not UROA, decreased oxidative stress in plasma and colon mucosa. Only UROA preserved colonic architecture. The normal formation of urolithins in PE-fed rats was prevented during inflammation. Our results suggest that UROA could be the most active anti-inflammatory compound derived from pomegranate ingestion in healthy subjects, whereas in colon inflammation, the effects could be due to the nonmetabolized ellagitannin-related fraction.",1
"Flavonoid content of U.S. fruits, vegetables, and nuts Analytical data are reported for 20 flavonoids (as aglycones) determined for more than 60 fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts collected from four regions across the United States at two times of the year. Sample collection was designed and implemented by the Nutrient Data Laboratory (USDA). Analyses of eight flavan-3-ols (catechin, catechin gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and gallocatechin gallate), six anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin), two flavanones (hesperetin and naringenin), two flavones (apigenin and luteolin), and two flavonols (myricetin and quercetin) were performed by the Food Composition Laboratory (USDA) using a hydrolysis method for the anthocyanidins, flavones, and flavonols and a direct extraction method for the flavan-3-ols and flavanones. Experimental results compare favorably (few statistically significant differences) to literature values in the flavonoid and proanthocyanidin database previously compiled by the Nutrient Data Laboratory. The results of this study showed a seasonal variation only for blueberries. This study also showed that the variation in the flavonoid content of foods, as purchased by the U.S. consumer, is very large. The relative standard deviation, averaged for each flavonoid in each food, was 168%.",1

"Authentication and quantitative analysis on the chemical profile of cassia bark (cortex cinnamomi) by high-pressure liquid chromatography Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could be applied in the quality control of this commodity.",1

"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations in fruit and leaf tissues of highbush blueberry Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.",1
"Effect of soaking, boiling, and steaming on total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of cool season food legumes The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant components and activities.",0
"Catechin is present as metabolites in human plasma after consumption of red wine Flavonoids are components of fruits, vegetables and wines. An abundance of flavonoids in the diet is correlated with reduced heart disease mortality, suggesting that they act as protective nutrients. However, little is known about the absorption and metabolism of flavonoids after normal foods are consumed. This study measured the levels of one abundant flavonoid, (+)-catechin, and its metabolites in plasma after five male and four female volunteers consumed 120 mL of red wine (RW) one day and de-alcoholized red wine (DRW) on a separate day. Each wine sample contained 35 +/- 1 mg catechin (mean +/- SEM). Plasma levels of catechin and its metabolite 3'-O-methylcatechin (3'MC) were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the trimethylsilylated (TMS) derivatives. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were determined after enzymatic hydrolysis. Before RW or DRW consumption, plasma levels of catechin, 3'MC and all conjugates were <2 nmol/L. After 1 h, average levels of catechin, 3'MC and all conjugates increased to 91 +/- 14 nmol/L (RW) and 81 +/- 11 nmol/L (DRW). At 1 h, 21 +/- 1% of the metabolites were methylated and <2% of catechin and 3'MC were unconjugated. Catechin was present as both a sulfate conjugate and a conjugate containing both glucuronide and sulfate residues. 3'MC was present primarily as a glucuronide conjugate. At every time point, catechin was present almost exclusively as metabolites, and these levels were independent of ethanol. Therefore, if flavonoids are protective nutrients, the active forms are likely to be metabolites, which are far more abundant in plasma than the forms that exist in foods.",1

"Extraction of rutin from buckwheat (Fagopyrum escuentum Moench) seeds and determination by capillary electrophoresis The content of the flavonoid rutin was determined in different milling fractions of buckwheat seeds and in buckwheat stems, leaves, and flowers. The extraction was performed by using a solvent containing 60% of ethanol and 5% of ammonia in water. The extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (running buffer of 50 mM borate (pH 9.3), 100 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate; determination at 380 nm). In bran fractions the concentration of rutin was 131-476 ppm, and in flour fractions 19-168 ppm. On average, about 300, 1000, and 46000 ppm of rutin were found in leaves, stems, and flowers, respectively. The results indicate that buckwheat could be an important nutritional source of flavonoids, especially in countries with a low mean daily flavonoid intake.",0
"Content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic acid compounds in conjunction with the antioxidant capacity for a variety of northwest Vaccinium berries This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present within these Vaccinium species.",0
"Determination of anthocyanidins in berries and red wine by high-performance liquid chromatography A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of anthocyanidins from berries and red wine is described. Delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and malvidin contents of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), black currant (Ribes nigrum), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa cv. Jonsok), and a Cabernet sauvignon (Vitis vinifera) red wine were determined. The aglycon forms of the anthocyanins present in the samples were revealed by acid hydrolysis. A reversed phase analytical column was employed to separate the anthocyanidins before identification by diode array detection. The suitability of the method was tested by determining the recovery (95-102% as aglycons and 69-104% from glycosides) for each anthocyanidin. Method repeatability was tested by charting the total aglycon content of two samples over a period of 14 analyses and determining the coefficients of variation (1.41% for bilberry and 2.56% for in-house reference material). The method developed proved thus to be effective for reliable determination of anthocyanidins from freeze-dried berry samples and red wine. The total anthocyanidin content of the tested samples was as follows: in-house reference material, 447 +/- 8 mg/100 g; strawberry, 23.8 +/- 0.4 mg/100 g; black currant, 135 +/- 3 mg/100 g; bilberry, 360 +/- 3 mg/100 g; and Cabernet sauvignon red wine, 26.1 +/- 0.1 mg/100 mL.",0

"Determination of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine and related biological products by HPLC and HPLC-ESI-MS-MS To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared with UV- and fluorescence detection.",1
"Method for determining the content of catechins in tea infusions by high-performance liquid chromatography A high-performance liquid chromatography method employing diode array detection was developed to determine levels of the major catechins present in black, green, and Jasmine tea infusions. Reversed-phase separations were performed on a C18 column using three gradients: acetonitrile-acetate buffer, methanol-acetate buffer, and acetonitrile-acetate buffer with ascorbic acid. The identities of the tea catechins were established by comparing absorbance spectra and retention times to reference standards chromatographed under identical conditions. Epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate were found in all the tea infusions examined, ranging in concentration from 1-13 mg dl-1. These levels indicate that even moderate tea consumption can contribute a substantial quantity of flavanols to the diet. Although some differences between the three brewed teas were evident, all were comparably good sources of these catechins.",1
"Determination of flavonoids and phenolics and their distribution in almonds Limited information is available concerning the qualitative and quantitative composition of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, in almonds. We determined total phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in California almond (Prunus dulcis) skins and kernels among the principal almond varieties (Butte, Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price) with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection and UV detection. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry under identical HPLC conditions was utilized to verify identities of the predominant flavonoids and phenolic acids. Total phenols ranged from 127 (Fritz) to 241 (Padre) mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight. The analyses were compiled to produce a data set of 18 flavonoids and three phenolic acids. The predominant flavonoids were isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (in combination), catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside at 16.81, 1.93, 1.17, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.50 mg/100 g of fresh weight almonds, respectively. Using the existing approach of calculating only the aglycone form of flavonoids for use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database, whole almonds would provide the most prevalent aglycones of isorhamnetin at 11.70 (3.32), kaempferol at 0.60 (0.17), catechin at 1.93 (0.55), quercetin at 0.72 (0.20), and epicatechin at 0.85 (0.24) mg/100 g of fresh weight (mg/oz serving), respectively. These data can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action underlying the relationship between almond consumption and health-related outcomes and provide values for whole and blanched almonds suitable for inclusion in nutrient databases.",1
"Quantification of genistein and genistin in soybeans and soybean products It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate cancers are greater than the Japanese.",0

"Urinary excretion of phenolic acids in rats fed cranberry Dietary flavonoids can be converted into phenolic acids by colonic microflora. Phenolic acids can then be absorbed into the circulation and may contribute to the health-promoting effects of the parent compounds. Phenolic acids can be further metabolized in other tissues via methylation and conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. The objectives of this study were to identify and quantify the urinary excretion of 19 phenolic acids and their conjugates in rats fed three levels of a concentrated cranberry powder (3.3, 6.6, and 33 mg/kg of diet). The basic diet used was AIN93G diet containing very low amounts of any polyphenolic compounds. Of the phenolic acids studied, the amounts excreted varied by 4 orders of magnitude, with hippuric acid being excreted in the highest quantities. Amounts of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (3HPPA), and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4HCA) excreted were in the range of 18-33 microg/mg creatinine in animals fed the highest level of cranberry powder, whereas phenylacetic acid (PAA), gallic acid (GA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (34HPAA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (34HBA), 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (34HCA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (FA) were excreted in the urine in concentrations of 0.1-2 microg/mg creatinine. As the amount of cranberry in the diet was increased, the amount of 4HPAA excreted decreased but the percentage of conjugated 4HPAA excreted increased (from 57 to 91%). For other phenolic acids analyzed, the percentage excreted in the conjugated form was approximately constant across levels of cranberry in the diet and ranged from 65 to 100% for the individual phenolic acids. Studies of bioactivity and health effects need to consider more than just the compound(s) in the food, because they can be metabolized to other lower molecular weight compounds, which in turn may also be methylated or conjugated in some form that may affect the perceived health effects.",0
"Pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in healthy volunteers fed freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 7 days Eleven subjects completed a clinical trial to determine the safety/tolerability of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) and to measure, in plasma and urine, specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.",0
"Avenanthramides in oats (Avena sativa) and structure-antioxidant activity relationships Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and chlorobenzene, respectively.",1
"Changes in polyphenolic content and radical-scavenging activity of sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas L.) during storage at optimal and low temperatures Polyphenolic content and radical-scavenging activities (RSA) of four sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivars were characterized after storage at optimal (15 degrees C) or low temperature (5 degrees C) for 0, 13, 26, and 37 days. The polyphenolic content increased during storage in three cultivars but not in 'Murasakimasari'. The change in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) correlated very well with polyphenolic content. The increases in polyphenolics and the RSA in 'Benimasari' were significantly greater during storage at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. The main polyphenolic components in all cultivars were chlorogenic acid (ChA) and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA). ChA level increased more at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, whereas that of 3,5-diCQA was greater at 15 degrees C. Caffeoylquinic acids and RSA in 'Murasakimasari', which contains a large amount of anthocyanin in flesh tissue, were extremely high at the beginning of storage and remained nearly constant or decreased over time. A non-caffeoylquinic acid component that increased during storage, especially in 'J-Red' at 15 degrees C, was purified by successive chromatographic steps. The isolate was identified as caffeoyl sucrose [CSu, 6-O-caffeoyl-(beta- d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1))-alpha-D-glucopyranoside] by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). These results suggest that storage under cultivar-dependent, controlled temperature is one approach for increasing desirable physiologic function associated with RSA of polyphenolic compounds in sweet potato roots.",0
"Contribution of chlorogenic acids to the iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages The iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages was determined by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The influence on FRAP due to the degree of roasting (light, medium, and dark), species (Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta), and caffeine content (regular and decaffeinated) was investigated using ground and soluble coffee samples. The concentration of specific chlorogenic acids and caffeine in the beverages was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and related to FRAP using Pearson correlation coefficients. All measurements were expressed per unit of soluble solids. Beverages prepared with ground coffee had, on average, 27% higher FRAP values than those prepared with soluble coffee (p < 0.05). In the former beverages, FRAP of C. robusta samples was significantly higher (on average, 50.3%) when compared to that of C. arabica samples, and FRAP values decreased with increasing degree of roasting (p < 0.05). A strong correlation (r > 0.91) was found between FRAP and the total content of chlorogenic acids, particularly that of the caffeoylquinic acid isomers. The iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages was not influenced by caffeine.",1
"Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut microbial flora to synthesize equol.",0

"Repeated oral administration of high doses of the pomegranate ellagitannin punicalagin to rats for 37 days is not toxic The water-soluble ellagitanin punicalagin has been reported to be toxic to cattle. Taking into account that this antioxidant polyphenol is very abundant in pomegranate juice (> or =2 g/L), the present study evaluated the possible toxic effect of punicalagin in Sprague-Dawley rats upon repeated oral administration of a 6% punicalagin-containing diet for 37 days. Punicalagin and related metabolites were identified by HPLC-DAD-MS-MS in plasma, liver, and kidney. Five punicalagin-related metabolites were detected in liver and kidney, that is, two ellagic acid derivatives, gallagic acid, 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one glucuronide, and 3,8,10-trihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one. Feedstuff intake, food utility index, and growth rate were lower in treated rats during the first 15 days without significant adverse effects, which could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet together with a decrease in its palatability (lower food intake). No significant differences were found in treated rats in any blood parameter analyzed (including the antioxidant enzymes gluthatione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) with the exception of urea and triglycerides, which remained at low values throughout the experiment. Although the reason for the decrease is unclear, it could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet with respect to the standard rat food. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney corroborated the absence of toxicity. In principle, the results reported here, together with the large safety margin considered, indicate the lack of toxic effect of punicalagin in rats during the 37 day period investigated. However, taking into account the high punicalagin content of pomegranate-derived foodstuffs, safety evaluation should be also carried out in humans with a lower dose and during a longer period of intake.",1
"Hippuric acid as a major excretion product associated with black tea consumption 1. Nine habitual tea-drinking volunteers were recruited and asked to follow a low-polyphenol and low-caffeine diet for 6 days and to provide daily 24-h urine samples. On day 4 of the experiment strong black tea brewed under standardized conditions was re-introduced to the volunteers' diet. 2. 1H-NMR and HPLC profiling of the urine samples indicated that consumption of black tea (6-10 mugs per day) was associated with a significant (p = 0.00017) increase in hippuric acid excretion relative to control, increasing from 153-512 to 742-1374 mg day(-1). The excretion of substantial amounts of hippuric acid has not previously been associated with black tea consumption. 3. For some volunteers, the quantity of benzoic acid processed exceeded the acceptable daily intake (ADI), but this is not considered to constitute any hazard. 4. A mass-balance analysis indicated that the necessary quantity of benzoic acid could not be obtained from the contents of gallic acid, flavanols, flavonol glycosides and theaflavins in black tea even if 100% transformation was obtained, suggesting that the thearubigins (the major and chemically ill-defined polyphenols of black tea) may be an important source.",1

"Phenolic acid metabolites as biomarkers for tea- and coffee-derived polyphenol exposure in human subjects Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. Many of the demonstrated activities are consistent with favourable effects on the risk of chronic diseases. 4-O-methylgallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid are potential biomarkers of exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid is derived from chlorogenic acid in coffee. Our major objective was to explore the relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid in human subjects. The relationships of long-term usual (111 participants) and contemporaneously recorded current (344 participants) tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid were assessed in two populations. 4OMGA was related to usual (r 0.50, P<0.001) and current (r 0.57, P<0.001) tea intake, and isoferulic acid was related to usual (r 0.26, P=0.008) and current (r 0.18, P<0.001) coffee intake. Overall, our present results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker for black tea-derived polyphenol exposure, but isoferulic acid may be of limited usefulness as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.",0
"Rapid quantification of the phenolic fraction of Spanish virgin olive oils by capillary electrophoresis with UV detection A rapid and reliable capillary zone electrophoresis method was used as a tool to obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about simple phenols, lignans, complex phenols (isomeric forms of secoiridoids), phenolic acids, and flavonoids in the solid-phase separation extracts from different Spanish extra-virgin olive oil in a short time (less than 6 min). Peak identification was done by using commercial and HPLC-isolated standards, studying the information of the electropherograms obtained at several wavelengths and also using the information previously reported. For the quantification of lignans and complex phenols (secoiridoid derivatives), we used a reference compound (oleuropein glucoside) at two different wavelengths (200 and 240 nm) and for the quantification of tyrosol and flavonoids, we used their commercially available standards.",1
"Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometric characterization of flavonol glycosides in tomato extracts and human plasma Flavonoids continue to attract wide attention as possible very useful agents for combating free radical pathologies, i.e. the pathological states associated with free radical overproduction. Commonly used methods for the analysis of plant flavonoids include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). On the other hand, the soft-ionization approach based on electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) permits highly selective analysis of complex matrices. In this work, we examined firstly the ESI-MS behaviour of representative aglycones and glycosides of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones with the aim of suggesting a possible relationship between structure and mass spectra. Using HPLC coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) for on-line UV spectra acquisition, and in parallel to ESI-MS for mass spectra (LC/DAD-ESI-MS), we have developed methodology to observe flavonols directly in tomato puree extract. In this way, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides in tomato extracts and to characterize a flavonol trisaccharide. For the first time, using LC/ESI-MS, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides in plasma of healthy volunteers and to provide further evidence on the absorption of flavonoid glycosides after consumption of common vegetables like tomatoes.",1

"Contents of resveratrol, piceid, and their isomers in commercially available wines made from grapes cultivated in Japan The presence of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and its beta-glucoside, piceid (resveratrol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers in wine appears to be one of the beneficial factors conferring a protective effect against cardiovascular disease through red wine ingestion. A total of 42 red and white wines was collected in areas from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The wines were fractionated with a C18 Sep-pak cartridge, and the active principles were eluted with ethyl acetate. Crude trans- and cis-piceid were extracted from a Chinese medicine, 'Kojohkon' (Polygonum cuspidatum), and their retention times and UV absorption were confirmed by HPLC. trans- and cis-Resveratrol, and trans- and cis-piceid were analyzed in a short C18 HPLC column, and cis-resveratrol was quantified from the amount of cis-isomer converted from authentic trans-resveratrol that had been treated by UV irradiation. The content of piceid is shown as the resveratrol equivalent. The average content of total stilbene compounds was 4.37 mg/liter in red wines, while only 0.68 mg/liter in white wines. Red wines made from Pinot noir, Merlot, and Zweigeltrebe grapes all had a high resveratrol content.",1
"Phenolic Content and Radical Scavenging Capacity of Berries and Related Jams from Certificated Area in Serbia Chemical composition and the effects of domestic processing and storage were studied in organically cultivated or wild growing berries, harvested in certificated area in Serbia. The total phenolics content in fresh berries ranged from 380 to 1660 mg GAE/100 g. The phenolic content decreased during the processing to jams, and storage in almost all samples, except in black currant. Among fresh berries, the highest amount of total anthocyanins was found in bilberry (0.61 +/- 0.03 %). Processing and storage caused decrease in anthocyanin content. The most ubiquitous anthocyanin aglycone was found to be cyanidin. Ellagic acid was detected in fresh and frozen black raspberries and related jams, and its content increases during thermal processing to jam. Among fresh berries, bilberry showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity with an IC(50) value of 0.82 mg/ml. However, frozen as well as processed berries in our study still showed comparable high values of radical scavenging activity. After 9 months of storage all investigated jams were microbiologicaly correct. Regardless of the losses in the amount of total phenolics, total anthocyanins and radical scavenging activity, frozen berries and related jams are still excellent sources of nutritional substances with antioxidant potential.",1
"Changes in Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Activity of Italian Extra-Virgin Olive Oils during Storage Phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of extra-virgin olive oils extracted from several Italian varieties were studied at production and during storage. The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: in the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and in the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic content was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and spectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various cultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly correlated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene test and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.",1
"Catechin Contents of Foods Commonly Consumed in The Netherlands. 2. Tea, Wine, Fruit juices and chocolate milk Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine (27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic diseases.",1
"A metabolite profiling approach to identify biomarkers of flavonoid intake in humans Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.",1
"Rapid, direct determination of polyphenols in tea by reversed-phase column liquid chromatography Column liquid chromatography on a C18-bonded silica column with water-methanol-acetic acid as eluent was used to determine polyphenols and caffeine in tea. Without any pretreatment, catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epicatechin and caffeine were separated successfully within 15 min. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of polyphenols studied were 1.8-24 mg/l at a detection wavelength 270 nm. The linear range of the peak area calibration curves for the analytes were over two orders of magnitude with a correlation coefficient of 0.996-0.999. Using this method, some Chinese tea samples were analyzed with a good reproducibility (RSD are below 5%).",1
"Storage effects on anthocyanins, phenolics and antioxidant activity of thermally processed conventional and organic blueberries Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for phytochemicals during their long-term storage.",0
"Metabolism of the olive oil phenols hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosyl acetate by human hepatoma HepG2 cells To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic model system.",1
"Urinary excretion of lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens in Japanese men and women consuming a traditional Japanese diet Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due to the high intake of soybean products.",1
"Evaluation of propolis polyphenols absorption in humans by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether (P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.",1
"Pelargonidin is absorbed and metabolized differently than cyanidin after marionberry consumption in pigs Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.",0
"Occurrence of anthocyanin-derived pigments in red wines Several anthocyanin-derived pigments that showed UV-visible spectra different from those of the original grape anthocyanins were detected by HPLC-DAD analysis in 1-year-old bottled Port wines from the Douro region. Among these, three malvidin 3-glucoside derived pigments were detected in large amounts, representing approximately 60% of the total anthocyanidin monoglucosides content. These pigments were isolated, purified, and identified by LSI-MS and NMR ((1)H, DQF-COSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) techniques. The major pigment is malvidin 3-glucoside pyruvic adduct, previously characterized, and the other two corresponded to its respective acetyl and coumaroyl glucoside derivatives. The latter is reported for the first time in red wines.",1
"Retention and changes of soy isoflavones and carotenoids in immature soybean seeds (Edamame) during processing Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed development.",0

"The relative contribution of the small and large intestine to the absorption and metabolism of rutin in man Tomato juice containing rutin (quercetin-3-rutinoside) was ingested by healthy volunteers and ileostomists. Blood and urine collected over 24 h were analysed by HPLC with photodiode array (PDA) and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Low concentrations of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide (Cmax = 4.3 +/- 1.5 nmoles/l) and quercetin-3-glucuronide (Cmax = 12 +/- 2 nmoles/l) were detected in plasma of healthy subjects. Metabolites appeared in blood after 4 h indicating absorption from the large intestine. Nine metabolites of rutin were detected in urine but with considerable variation in total amount (40 +/- 1-4981 +/- 115 nmoles over 24 h). No metabolites were detected in plasma or urine of ileostomists and 86 +/- 3% of the ingested rutin was recovered in ileal fluid. In subjects with an intact large intestine, but not ileostomists, rutin was catabolised with the appearance of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in urine accounting for 22% of rutin intake.",1

"In vivo comparison of the bioavailability of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their mixture in orally administered rats We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of rats.",0
"Flavanone absorption after naringin, hesperidin, and citrus administration Disposition of citrus flavonoids was evaluated after single oral doses of pure compounds (500 mg naringin and 500 mg hesperidin) and after multiple doses of combined grapefruit juice and orange juice and of once-daily grapefruit. Cumulative urinary recovery indicated low bioavailability ( < 25%) of naringin and hesperidin. The aglycones naringenin and hesperitin were detected in urine and plasma by positive chemical ionization-collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (PCI-CAD MS/MS). After juice administration, PCI-CAD MS/MS detected naringenin, hesperitin, and four related flavanones, tentatively identified as monomethoxy and dimethoxy derivatives. These methoxyflavanones appear to be absorbed from juice. Absorbed citrus flavanones may undergo glucuronidation before urinary excretion.",1
"Absorption, metabolism and excretion of flavanones from single portions of orange fruit and juice and effects of anthropometric variables and contraceptive pill use on flavanone excretion Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in flavanone excretion.",1
"Separation and determination of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside oligomers and their hydrolysates in the flaxseed extract by high-performance liquid chromatography Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol (SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.",1

"Evaluation of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil by direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon (3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.",1
"Phenolic acids, syringaldehyde, and juglone in fruits of different cultivars of juglans regia L Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid (cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).",0
"Bioavailability of anthocyanins from purple carrot juice: effects of acylation and plant matrix Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.",1

"Determination of proanthocyanidins and catechins in beer and barley by high-performance liquid chromatography with dual-electrode electrochemical detection A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in Ireland.",0
"Quantitative changes in phenolic content during physiological development of the olive (Olea europaea) cultivar Hardy's Mammoth This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.",0
"Quantitation of polymethoxylated flavones in orange juice by high-performance liquid chromatography A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature. The HPLC procedure is considerably faster than the TLC procedure with equal or superior precision and accuracy.",0

"Levels of flavan-3-ols in French wines French wines are abundant sources of phenolic compounds. The content of several catechins, i.e., (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4, trimers C1, and trimer 2 (T2), of 160 French wines was determined by HPLC with UV detection. Red wines (n = 95) were found to have high levels of catechins, ranging from 32.8 to 209.8 mg/L (mean concentration 114.5 mg/L) for (+)-catechin, from 22.1 to 130.7 mg/L (mean concentration 75.7 mg/L) for (-)-epicatechin, from 7.8 to 39.1 mg/L (mean concentration 25.4 mg/L) for B1, from 18.3 to 93 mg/L (mean concentration 47.4 mg/L) for B2, from 21.4 to 215.6 mg/L (mean concentration 119.6 mg/L) for B3, from 20.2 to 107.2 mg/L (mean concentration 81.9 mg/l) for B4, from 8.6 to 36.9 mg/L (mean concentration 26.3 mg/L) for C1, and from 26.7 to 79.3 mg/L (mean concentration 67.1 mg/L) for T2. White and rosé wines (n = 57 and n = 8) were found to have low levels of (+)-catechin (mean concentrations 9.8 and 10.6 mg/L, respectively) and (-)-epicatechin (mean concentrations 5.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). These data provide a basis for the epidemiological evaluation of catechin intake by the consumption of French wine.",1
"Comparison of various extraction techniques for isolation and determination of isoflavonoids in plants In the present paper, the following extraction techniques have been used for extracting isoflavonoids from the species Matricaria recutita, Rosmarinus officinalis, Foeniculum vulgare, and Agrimonia eupatoria L.: supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), pressurized fluid extraction, matrix solid phase dispersion, ultrasonic extraction in an ultrasonic bath (USE) and by means of an ultrasonic homogeniser (HOM), extraction by means of Soxhlet apparatus (SOX), and solid phase extraction. Experimental optimization of all techniques has been carried out using a soybean flour. Subsequent analyses of the extracts were carried out by liquid chromatography with UV detection. The maximum yields of daidzein and genistein were obtained by extraction with the SOX, USE, and HOM techniques. The maximum yields of apigenin and biochanin A from herb samples were obtained by SFE.",1
"Analysis of phenolic constituents of biological interest in red wines by high-performance liquid chromatography We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and diode array detection to determine four biologically active phenolic constituents of red wines: gallic acid, trans-resveratrol, quercetin and rutin. The method permits direct injection without sample pre-treatment. ODS Hypersil served as the stationary phase; the gradient was formed by acetic acid, methanol, and water. Each analysis required an equilibration period of 10 min and a run time of 50 min for completion. Previously, total phenols were analysed according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, using gallic acid as the standard, and the results are given as gallic acid equivalent.",1
"In vivo comparison of the bioavailability of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their mixture in orally administered rats We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of rats.",1
"Ferulic acid dehydromers from wheat bran: isolation, purification and antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diferulic acid Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major dimers released were: trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), (Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid (5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.",1
"Study of polyphenols in grape berries by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography Several polyphenols have been tested in grape berries from Spain. The flavonoid content is important because of the pharmacological properties of these compounds, whereas resveratrol has been proved to be an antifungal, antiinflammatory and an anticarcinogenic compound. A reversed-phase HPLC method has been developed and applied to determine resveratrol, quercetine, quercitrine and rutine content in several grape berries samples in a single analysis. Covering the grapes with a preservative paper yields a healthier product, but one which has a lower polyphenol content than unprotected grapes.",1
"Berry phenolics and their antioxidant activity Phenolic profiles of a total of 26 berry samples, together with 2 apple samples, were analyzed without hydrolysis of glycosides with HPLC. The phenolic contents among different berry genera varied considerably. Anthocyanins were the main phenolic constituents in bilberry, bog-whortleberry, and cranberry, but in cowberries, belonging also to the family Ericaceae genus Vaccinium, flavanols and procyanidins predominated. In the family Rosaceae genus Rubus (cloudberry and red raspberry), the main phenolics found were ellagitannins, and in genus Fragaria (strawberry), ellagitannins were the second largest group after anthocyanins. However, phenolic acids were dominant in rowanberries (genus Sorbus) and anthocyanins in chokeberry (genus Aronia). In the family Grossulariaceae genus Ribes (currants and gooseberry), anthocyanins predominated, as well as in crowberries (family Empetraceae genus Empetrum). In apples, hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic subgroup. Extraction methods for berries and apples were studied to produce phenolic extracts with high antioxidant activity. Evaluation of antioxidant activity was performed by autoxidazing methyl linoleate (40 degrees C, in the dark). The extraction method affected remarkably both the phenolic composition and the antioxidant activity, but with statistical analysis the observed activity could not be well explained with the contents of individual phenolic subgroups.",0

"Flavonoids in vegetable foods commonly consumed in Brazil and estimated ingestion by the Brazilian population The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory (18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.",0

"HPLC method for the quantification of procyanidins in cocoa and chocolate samples and correlation to total antioxidant capacity Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay as an indicator for potential biological activity.",1
"Absorption, conjugation and excretion of the flavanones, naringenin and hesperetin from alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice in human subjects We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in dose.",1

"Anthocyanin glycosides from berry fruit are absorbed and excreted unmetabolized by both humans and rats Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.",0
"Daidzein and genistein concentrations in human milk after soy consumption Soy isoflavones were quantified from human milk by a fast, precise, and selective HPLC method after enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated isoflavones and extraction with ethyl acetate. Isoflavone aglycones and their mammalian metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin were separated selectively and identified by absorbance patterns, fluorometric and electrochemical detection, gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis after trimethylsilylation, and with internal and external authentic standards. HPLC injections of 20 microL of human milk showed detection limits of 1-3 pmol for all analytes by using diode-array detection. The detection limit could be improved by as much as 1000-fold by extended concentration through partitioning with ethyl acetate, by using electrochemical detection, by increasing the injection volumes, or by combining these techniques. We used the proposed method to monitor isoflavone concentrations in human milk and in human urine after challenge with 5, 10, and 20 g of roasted soybeans in the diet. Implications of the results for the potential of isoflavones to prevent cancer in newborn infants exposed to these agents are discussed.",0
"Phenolic Content, Composition, Antioxidant Activity, and Their Changes during Domestic Cooking of Potatoes Potatoes in the diet contribute significantly to antioxidant daily intake worldwide. The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert influence on the antioxidant capacity. The results imply that the potato varieties rich in antioxidant components could be good antioxidant sources as activities are not greatly affected by different cooking conditions.",1
"Bioavailability of Anthocyanins and Ellagitannins Following Consumption of Raspberries by Healthy Humans and Subjects with an Ileostomy The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.",1
"Urinary excretion of black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) anthocyanins and their metabolites Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of cyanidin-3-rutinoside.",0
"Bioavailability of isoflavones after ingestion of soy beverages in healthy adults It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.",0
"Identification and quantification of the conjugated metabolites derived from orally administered hesperidin in rat plasma Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using these authentic compounds, the concentrations of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from orally administered hesperidin.",0

"Qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils as a function of the ripening degree of olive fruits by different analytical techniques Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.",1
"Characterization of isoflavones and their conjugates in female rat urine using LC/MS/MS Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.",0

"Phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of Georgia-grown blueberries and blackberries Blueberries and blackberries grown at various locations in Georgia were collected and analyzed for flavonoids, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols, and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Each sample was analyzed for phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and ellagic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array detection was used for analysis. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on retention time and UV spectra by comparison with pure commercial standards. Phenolic acids ranged from 0.19 to 258.90 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), and flavonoids ranged from 2.50 to 387.48 mg/100 g FW. Total polyphenols ranged from 261.95 to 929.62 mg/100 g FW, and total anthocyanins ranged from 12.70 to 197.34 mg/100 g FW. TEAC values varied from 8.11 to a maximum of 38.29 microM/g FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are rich sources of antioxidants.",1
"Green tea flavan-3-ols: colonic degradation and urinary excretion of catabolites by humans Following the ingestion of green tea, substantial quantities of flavan-3-ols pass from the small to the large intestine (Stalmach et al. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, 53, S44-S53; Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200900194). To investigate the fate of the flavan-3-ols entering the large intestine, where they are subjected to the action of the colonic microflora, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate were incubated in vitro with fecal slurries and the production of phenolic acid catabolites was determined by GC-MS. In addition, urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites was investigated over a 24 h period after ingestion of either green tea or water by healthy volunteers with a functioning colon. The green tea was also fed to ileostomists, and 0-24 h urinary excretion of phenolic acid catabolites was monitored. Pathways are proposed for the degradation of green tea flavan-3-ols in the colon and further catabolism of phenolic compounds passing into the circulatory system from the large intestine, prior to urinary excretion in quantities corresponding to ca. 40% of intake compared with ca. 8% absorption of flavan-3-ol methyl, glucuronide, and sulfate metabolites in the small intestine. The data obtained point to the importance of the colonic microflora in the overall bioavailability and potential bioactivity of dietary flavonoids.",0

"Absorption of red clover isoflavones in human subjects: results from a pilot study In addition to soya-derived preparations, red clover-based dietary supplements have gained considerable interest as an alternative isoflavone (IF) source. While metabolism and bioavailability of the main IF from both sources have already been investigated, studies are still lacking on the biokinetic behaviour of IF, which are present in red clover in minor amounts. In the present pilot study, in which seven volunteers ingested a single dose of a commercial red clover dietary supplement, we focused on the absorption of three such IF, irilone (IRI), prunetin (PRUN) and pseudobaptigenin (PBAP). The compounds were measured as aglycones after enzymatic hydrolysis. A single intake of an amount of as low as 3.8 mg IRI (out of 38.8 mg IF in total) resulted in an IRI plasma concentration of 0.35 (sd 0.16) mum at 6.5 h post-ingestion. Compared to the plasma concentrations found for daidzein (0.39 mum) and genistein (0.06 mum), expected to be the main IF metabolites in plasma, the present findings indicate that IRI might possess a relatively high bioavailability. Furthermore, PRUN and PBAP were detected in human plasma for the first time.",1

"Chlorogenic acids and lactones in regular and water-decaffeinated arabica coffees The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final beverage, suggesting the need for further study.",0
"Improved method for identifying and quantifying olive oil phenolic compounds and their metabolites in human plasma by microelution solid-phase extraction plate and liquid chromatography-tandem mass sp Two methods based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) using traditional cartridges and microelution SPE plates (muSPE) as the sample pre-treatment, and an improved liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were developed and compared to determine the phenolic compounds in virgin oil olive from plasma samples. The phenolic compounds studied were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, homovanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, luteolin, apigenin, pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol. Good recoveries were obtained in both methods, and the LOQs and LODs were similar, in the range of low muM. The advantage of muSPE, in comparison with SPE cartridges, was the lack of the evaporation step to pre-concentrate the analytes. The muSPE-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method developed was then applied to determine the phenolic compounds and their metabolites, in glucuronide, sulphate and methylated forms, in human plasma after the ingestion of virgin olive oil.",1
"Comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as ""olive oil"" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.",1
"Resveratrol, pterostilbene, and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries A study was conducted to determine the presence of resveratrol, pterostilbene, and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries. Samples representing selections and cultivars of 10 species from Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, and Canada were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resveratrol was found in Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry), Vaccinium arboretum (sparkleberry), Vaccinium ashei (rabbiteye blueberry), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush blueberry), Vaccinium elliottii (Elliott's blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium stamineum (deerberry), Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.",1
"Phenol antioxidant quantity and quality in foods: beers and the effect of two types of beer on an animal model of atherosclerosis The free phenols have been measured in 15 lagers, 6 porters and ales, and 11 light and nonalcoholic beers. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using an oxidation-reduction reaction with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and catechin as the standard. The order of phenol concentration was ales > lagers > low calorie > nonalcoholic. The quality of antioxidants of the major phenols in beers and the quality of beer antioxidants were measured by (1) dose-response inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation and (2) concentration of phenols in the beers at which 50% of the peroxide was destroyed in a luminescent assay for antioxidant activity. The beers' lipoprotein antioxidant quality was clearly superior to that of vitamin antioxidants and to that of the phenol ingredients, suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. The average per capita consumption of beer in the United States in 2000 was 225 mL/day, equivalent to 42 mg/day of catechin equivalents. Beer provides more antioxidants per day than wine in the U.S. diet. A dark beer and a lager beer were given at two concentrations to cholesterol-fed hamsters, an animal model of atherosclerosis. At the high dose ((1)/(2)-diluted beer) both lager and dark beer significantly inhibited atherosclerosis compared to a control of 2% alcohol. At the high dose, lager significantly decreased cholesterol and triglycerides, and both beers acted as in vivo antioxidants by decreasing the oxidizability of lower density lipoproteins. At the low dose ((1)/(10)-diluted beer) only the lager beer significantly decreased atherosclerosis compared to the 0.4% alcohol control. The polyphenols in the beers appear to be responsible for the benefits of beer in this model. Lager beer inhibited atherosclerosis at a human equivalent dose in this hamster model of atherosclerosis.",0
"Spectrophotometric determination of the tannin contents of various Turkish black tea, beer and wine samples This study reports tannin contents of various tea (19), beer (6) and wine (6) samples, produced or sold in Turkey under different brand names. Determinations were carried out by employing a previously reported UV-vis spectrophotometric method. The standard addition procedure was also compared to the direct determination procedure and found to be more reliable. The tannin contents of hot water extracts of tea, tea bag and herbal tea samples ranged between 6.20-8.33, 8.03-6.59 and 2.76-6.54 percent (w/w) respectively. Tannin contents of beer and wine samples determined without extraction were found ranging between 66.36-77.26 and 67.18-107.62 micrograms/mL respectively. Iron contents of analysed wine samples were also found ranging between 0.36 and 10.33 ppm by AAS and no relation is found between tannin and iron contents.",0

"Effect of plant growth temperature on antioxidant capacity in strawberry The influence of four day/night growing temperature combinations (18/12, 25/12, 25/22, and 30/22 degrees C) on phenolic acid, flavonol, and anthocyanin content and their antioxidant activities against peroxyl radicals (ROO(*)), superoxide radicals (O(2)(*)(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), hydroxyl radicals (OH(*)), and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) in fruit juice of Earliglow and Kent strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) cultivars was studied. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside (291.3-945.1 microg/g fresh wt.), pelargonidin 3-rutinoside (24.7-50.9 microg/g fresh wt.), and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate (62.2-244.0 microg/g fresh wt.) were the predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit juice. The content of cyanidin-based anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins. Strawberry growth in high temperature conditions significantly enhanced the content of p-coumaroylglucose, dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate in strawberry juice. Plants grown in the cool day and cool night temperature (18/12 degrees C) generally had the lowest phenolic acid, flavonols, and anthocyanins. An increase in night temperature from 12 to 22 degrees C, with the day temperature kept constant at 25 degrees C, resulted in a significant increase in phenolic acid, flavonols, and anthocyanins. These conditions also resulted in a significant increase in antioxidant capacity. The highest day/night temperature (30/22 degrees C) yielded fruit with the most phenolic content as well as ROO(*), O(2)(*)(-), H(2)O(2), OH(*), and (1)O(2) radical absorbance capacity. Fruit of Kent cv. strawberry had higher values of phenolic acid, flavonols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacities than fruit of Earliglow cv. strawberry under all temperature regimes.",1
"Absorption, metabolism, and antioxidant effects of pomegranate (Punica granatum l.) polyphenols after ingestion of a standardized extract in healthy human volunteers The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo antioxidant effects.",0
"Structure-Antioxidant Efficiency Relationships of Phenolic Compounds and Their Contribution to the Antioxidant Activity of Sea Buckthorn Juice The phenolic composition of juice derived from fruits of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array and electrochemical detection. Flavonols were found to be the predominating polyphenols while phenolic acids and catechins represent minor components. Of the seven flavonols identified, isorhamnetin 3-O-glycosides were the most important representatives quantitatively. However, because of their structural properties, they were poor radical scavengers as shown by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Phenolic compounds such as quercetin 3-O-glycosides, catechins, and hydroxybenzoic acids with a catechol structure exhibited good antioxidant capacities, but their concentration in sea buckthorn juice was small. These phenolic compounds, determined by HPLC, accounted for less than 5% of the total antioxidant activity of the filtered juice. Ascorbic acid was shown to be the major antioxidant in sea buckthorn juice. Because of its high concentration of 1.22 g/L, it contributes approximately 75% to total antioxidant activity. The remaining difference can be attributed to higher molecular weight flavan-3-ols (proanthocyanidins), which were determined photometrically after acid depolymerization to colored anthocyanidins.",0
"On-line high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in green and black tea Teas represent a rich source of dietary antioxidants. This paper describes analysis of the antioxidant potential of individual tea phenolics using an on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Tea phenolics from Kenyan green and black teas were identified using liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) in conjunction with the analysis of their 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+) radical scavenging ability. Antioxidant potential of flavan-3-ols, caffeoylquinic acids, flavonols, and theaflavins was assessed in comparison to the synthetic vitamin E analogue Trolox. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate was identified as the most potent antioxidant with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 3.0, contributing approximately 30% of the total antioxidant capacity of green tea. Theaflavins retained antioxidant capacity similar to that of (-)-epicatechin monomers whilst conjugated flavonols did not contribute significantly to the antioxidant capacity of either green or black tea. After HPLC analysis of the antioxidant capacity of phenolics in black tea some 80% of antioxidant activity remained unaccounted for indicating the potential importance of thearubigens as antioxidants in black teas.",1
"Phenolic compounds profile of Cornicabra virgin olive oil This study presents the phenolic compounds profile of commercial Cornicabra virgin olive oils from five successive crop seasons (1995/1996 to 1999/2000; n = 97), determined by solid phase extraction reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (SPE RP-HPLC), and its relationship with oxidative stability, processing conditions, and a preliminary study on variety classification. The median of total phenols content was 38 ppm (as syringic acid), although a wide range was observed, from 11 to 76 ppm. The main phenols found were the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol (p-HPEA-EDA; 9 +/- 7 ppm, as median and interquartile range), oleuropein aglycon (8 +/- 6 ppm), and the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA; 5 +/- 8 ppm). In many cases the correlation with oxidative stability was higher when the sum of the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) and oleuropein aglycon (r (2) = 0.91-0.96) or the sum of these two and hydroxytyrosol (r (2) = 0.90-0.97) was considered than was observed with HPLC total phenols (r (2)= 0.91-0.95) and especially with colorimetric determination of total polyphenols and o-diphenols (r (2) = 0.77-0.95 and 0.78-0.92, respectively). 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, the aglycons of oleuropein and ligstroside, and HPLC total phenols content presented highly significant differences (p = 0.001-0.010) with respect to the dual- and triple-phase extraction systems used, whereas colorimetric total polyphenols content did not (p = 0.348) and o-diphenols showed a much lower significant difference (p = 0.031). The five variables that most satisfactorily classified the principal commercial Spanish virgin olive oil varieties were 1-acetoxypinoresinol, 4-(acetoxyethyl)-1,2-dihydroxybenzene (3,4-DHPEA-AC), ligstroside aglycon, p-HPEA-EDA, and RT 43.3 contents.",1
"Authentication and quantitative analysis on the chemical profile of cassia bark (cortex cinnamomi) by high-pressure liquid chromatography Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could be applied in the quality control of this commodity.",0

"Concentration and solubility of flavanones in orange beverages affect their bioavailability in humans Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the gut.",1
"Catechin Contents of Foods Commonly Consumed in The Netherlands. 2. Tea, Wine, Fruit juices and chocolate milk Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine (27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic diseases.",0
"Sesamin is one of the major precursors of mammalian lignans in sesame seed (Sesamum indicum) as observed in vitro and in rats Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to mammalian lignans is suggested.",0

"HPLC method for analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside in flaxseeds A method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseeds. The analytical method involves extraction of defatted flaxseed flour with dioxane/ethanol, aqueous base-hydrolysis, solid-phase purification of an SDG-containing fraction, and quantitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pure SDG was isolated from flaxseed using different column chromatographic methods and used, as external standard, for the calibration of the method and for quantification. The method was then applied to study the variation in SDG content in flaxseeds from 14 cultivars grown in Sweden and 15 cultivars grown in Denmark. The SDG content varied between 11.7 and 24.1 mg/g in defatted flaxseed flour and between 6.1 and 13.3 mg/g in whole flaxseeds.",1

"Characterization of major anthocyanins and the color of red-fleshed budd blood orange (Citrus sinensis) High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood (Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside (33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.",0
"High-amylose corn exhibits better antioxidant activity than typical and waxy genotypes The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) corn genotypes.",1
"Phenolic Content, Composition, Antioxidant Activity, and Their Changes during Domestic Cooking of Potatoes Potatoes in the diet contribute significantly to antioxidant daily intake worldwide. The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert influence on the antioxidant capacity. The results imply that the potato varieties rich in antioxidant components could be good antioxidant sources as activities are not greatly affected by different cooking conditions.",0
"Interaction of vitamin C and flavonoids in elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) during juice processing A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of ascorbic acid.",1
"Chemical Studies of Phytoestrogens and Related-Compounds in Dietary-Supplements - Flax and Chaparral High-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) and mass spectrometric (MS) procedures were developed to determine lignans in flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) and chaparral (Larrea tridentata). Flaxseed contains high levels of phytoestrogens. Chaparral has been associated with acute nonviral toxic hepatitis and contains lignans that are structurally similar to known estrogenic compounds. Both flaxseed and chaparral products have been marketed as dietary supplements. A mild enzyme hydrolysis procedure to prevent the formation of artifacts in the isolation step was used in the determination of secoisolariciresinol in flaxseed products. HPLC with ultraviolet spectral (UV) or MS detection was used as the determinative steps. HPLC procedures with UV detection and mass spectrometry were developed to characterize the phenolic components, including lignans and flavonoids, of chaparral and to direct fractionation studies for the bioassays.",1
"Anthocyanin glycosides from berry fruit are absorbed and excreted unmetabolized by both humans and rats Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.",1
"Comparison of the main bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities in garlic and white and red onions after treatment protocols Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in garlic than in onions.

The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 to 112 kDa.",0
"The bioavailability of raspberry anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.",1
"Antioxidant capacity and phytochemical content of herbs and spices in dry, fresh and blended herb paste form We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.",0
"Superoxide radical scavenging activity of the major polyphenols in fresh plums The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) = 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums. However, they showed relatively low contribution to the total SRSA.",1

"Determination of free and total phenolic acids in plant-derived foods by HPLC with diode-array detection A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify free and total phenolic acids (m-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid) in plant foods. Free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and 10% acetic acid. Bound phenolic acids were liberated using first alkaline and then acid hydrolysis followed by extraction with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate (1:1). All fractions were quantified separately by HPLC. After HPLC quantification, results of alkali and acid hydrolysates were calculated to represent total phenolic acids. Ellagic acid was quantified separately after long (20 h) acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the determination of phenolic acids in plant foods. DAD response was linear for all phenolic acids within the ranges evaluated, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.999. Coefficients of variation for 4-8 sample replicates were consistently below 10%. Recovery tests of phenolic acids were performed for every hydrolysis condition using several samples. Recoveries were generally good (mean >90%) with the exceptions of gallic acid and, in some cases, caffeic acid samples.",0
"Discrimination of olive oils and fruits into cultivars and maturity stages based on phenolic and volatile compounds Olive oil and fruit samples from six cultivars sampled at four different maturity stages were discriminated into cultivars and maturity stages. The variables-volatile and phenolic compounds-that significantly (p < 0.01) discriminated cultivars and maturity stage groups were identified. Separation by stepwise linear discriminant analysis revealed that Manzanilla olive cultivar was separated from cultivars Leccino, Barnea, Mission, Corregiola, and Paragon, whereas cultivars Corregiola and Paragon formed a cluster. The volatile compounds hexanol, hexanal, and 1-penten-3-ol were responsible for the discrimination of cultivars. All maturity stages were discriminated, with the separation of early stages attributed to oil phenolic compounds, tyrosol and oleuropein derivatives, whereas the volatile compounds (E)-2-hexenal, hexanol, 1-penten-3-ol, and (Z)-2-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of all maturity stages and in particular the late stages. Hexanol and 1-penten-3-ol characterized the separation of both cultivars and maturity stages.",1
"Profile of plasma and urine metabolites after the intake of almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb] polyphenols in humans Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of (epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.",0
"Absorption, metabolism and excretion of Choladi green tea flavan-3-ols by humans Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while (epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of (epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.",1
"Simultaneous quantification of oleuropein and its metabolites in rat plasma by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry Oleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea and possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite the plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of olive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been published to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its major metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites hydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid in rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after enzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for all compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were linear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method exhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection was in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the nanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method was simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the simultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat plasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well as bioavailability and metabolism studies.",1
"Flavanone absorption after naringin, hesperidin, and citrus administration Disposition of citrus flavonoids was evaluated after single oral doses of pure compounds (500 mg naringin and 500 mg hesperidin) and after multiple doses of combined grapefruit juice and orange juice and of once-daily grapefruit. Cumulative urinary recovery indicated low bioavailability ( < 25%) of naringin and hesperidin. The aglycones naringenin and hesperitin were detected in urine and plasma by positive chemical ionization-collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (PCI-CAD MS/MS). After juice administration, PCI-CAD MS/MS detected naringenin, hesperitin, and four related flavanones, tentatively identified as monomethoxy and dimethoxy derivatives. These methoxyflavanones appear to be absorbed from juice. Absorbed citrus flavanones may undergo glucuronidation before urinary excretion.",0
"Determination of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine and related biological products by HPLC and HPLC-ESI-MS-MS To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared with UV- and fluorescence detection.",0

"The differential tissue distribution of the citrus flavanone naringenin following gastric instillation Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.",0
"Olive oils rich in natural catecholic phenols decrease isoprostane excretion in humans This study was undertaken to evaluate, in humans, the antioxidant activity of olive oil phenolics, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone that share an orthodiphenolic (catecholic) structure. Human volunteers were administered olive oil samples containing increasing amounts of an olive oil phenolic extract that was characterized by gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry. The administration of phenol-rich oils was dose-dependently associated with a decreased urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), a biomarker of oxidative stress. Also, a statistically significant negative correlation between homovanillyl alcohol (HValc, hydroxytyrosol's major metabolite, formed through the COMT system) and F(2)-isoprostanes excretion was found. Thus, the administration of oil samples with increasing, albeit low, concentrations of orthodiphenolic compounds, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone, results in a dose-dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha). The statistically significant negative correlation between 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and HValc urinary concentrations suggests that this metabolite better reflects the in vivo activities of hydroxytyrosol.",1
"Phenolic antioxidants richly contained in corn bran are slightly bioavailable in rats Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran (RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.",1

"trans-Resveratrol content in commercial peanuts and peanut products A modified high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for determination of trans-resveratrol (resveratrol) in peanuts and peanut products has been developed. Resveratrol was extracted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v) by blending with diatomaceous earth at high speed followed by purification of an aliquot of the extract on a minicolumn packed with Al(2)O(3)-ODS (C(18)) mixture. The column was eluted with acetonitrile-water (90/10, v/v), eluate was evaporated under nitrogen, and residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase. Resveratrol in an aliquot of purified extract was quantitated by HPLC on silica gel with n-hexane-2-propanol-water-acetonitrile-acetic acid (1050/270/17/5/1, v/v) as a mobile phase. The recovery of resveratrol added to diatomaceous earth at 0.05 microg/g was 98.95 +/- 17.79%; the recovery of the standard added to fresh peanuts (with 0.070 microg/g natural level of resveratrol) at 0.50, 5.00, and 10.00 microg/g was 117.23 +/- 8.87, 100.10 +/- 2.49, and 100.45 +/- 1.51%, respectively. The quantitation limit of resveratrol in fresh peanuts was about 0. 01 microg/g. Roasted peanuts had the lowest content of resveratrol of 0.055 +/- 0.023 microg/g (n = 21), while in peanut butter its concentration was significantly higher, 0.324 +/- 0.129 microg/g (n = 46), and boiled peanuts had the highest level of 5.138 +/- 2.849 microg/g (n = 12). Resveratrol content in commercial peanut products was similar to the resveratrol content of the raw peanut fractions routinely used for making them.",0
"Survey of the Free and Conjugated Myricetin and Quercetin Content of Red Wines of Different Geographical Origins Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical regions.",1
"Tissue distribution of isoflavones in ewes after consumption of red clover silage When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.",1
"Vitisin A content in Chilean wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and contribution to the color of aged red wines Vitisin A was prepared from malvidin 3-glucoside and pyruvic acid in model wine medium, isolated by countercurrent chromatography, and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The synthesized compound was used as a reference standard to quantify vitisin A in Chilean wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, including a vertical row of wines from the same vineyard over 16 years. Maximum vitisin A content was reached within the first year of storage. Importantly, up to half of the initial amount of vitisin A in young wines was still present in 15 year old wines. Although vitisin A was found to be much more stable as compared to other monomeric C-4 underivatized anthocyanins, it also slowly degrades after reaching its peak concentration. The ""color activity concept"" was applied to vitisin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, malvidin 3-(6' '-acetylglucoside), and polymeric pigments isolated by countercurrent chromatography in order to estimate their contribution toward the overall color expression of wines. It was found that vitisin A is only a minor contributor to the visually perceived color of aged red wines (color contribution approximately 5%). The major contributor is the polymeric fraction (color contribution approximately 70-90%).",0
"Polyphenolic composition of raisins The polyphenolics of raisins were extracted, separated by HPLC, and characterized by their UV-vis spectra, and their concentrations measured. Color measurements and browning indices were also determined. Samples (n = 20) included sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins. Comparisons were also made with fresh and frozen Thompson Seedless grapes. Golden raisins (which are treated with SO(2)) had the highest amount of hydroxycinnamic acids and the highest lightness values. In comparison with fresh grapes, percent losses of the two major hydroxycinnamics (caftaric and coutaric acids) in sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins were on the order of 90%. Flavonols were not influenced by processing as much as hydroxycinnamics, while procyanidins and flavan-3-ols were completely degraded in all raisin samples. Formation of hydroxymethylfurfural and loss of amino acids in sun-dried and dipped raisins are ascribed to Maillard browning reactions.",1
"Flavanol and flavonol contents of cocoa powder products: Influence of the manufacturing process Major brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were analyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and flavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), quercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the manufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, (-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into (-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of cocoa powder products.",1
"Distribution of conjugated and free phenols in fruits: antioxidant activity and cultivar variations Total and free phenolic contents of 16 commonly consumed fruits (comprising 9 apples, 4 pears, and one each of peach, plum, and kiwi fruit cultivars) were measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Total phenol contents varied from 272 to 475 mg of CtE/100 g of fresh weight. Of the apple cultivars studied, Braeburn and Empire had the highest and lowest total phenol content, respectively. The apple cultivars ranked in the following decreasing order: Braeburn > Red Delicious > Crisp Pink > Granny Smith > Royal Gala > Bramley > Golden Delicious > Fuji > Empire. Among pear cultivars, the order was Forelle > Taylor's > Peckham's > Conference. Peach and plum equally had high contents. The percentage of conjugated phenolics ranged between 3 (Red Delicious) and 77% (Empire) of the total phenols. Comparison of different cultivars of the same fruit and between different fruits showed broad variations in both phenolic content and in vitro antioxidant activity; a weak correlation (R(2) = 0.58) was observed between the phenolic content of the fruits and the total antioxidant activity, as estimated by the FRAP assay. The calculated dietary intake of total, free, and conjugated phenols from average per capita consumption of apples and pears in different regions of the U.K. varied between 104-126, 53-64, and 51-62 mg of CtE/day, respectively.",1

"Bioavailability is improved by enzymatic modification of the citrus flavonoid hesperidin in humans: a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers (n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose (7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.",1
"Identification and quantification of low molecular weight phenolic antioxidants in seeds of evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L.) Crude extracts of evening primrose meal were prepared in 56% (v/v) acetone and separated into six fractions (I-VI) using a Sephadex LH-20 column. Qualitative tests for phenolic and vanillin positive compounds produced positive results for all fractions. Silica gel thin-layer chromatography of fractions III and V allowed the location and isolation of two spots containing moderate to strong antioxidative compounds. High-performance liquid chromatography of the spot isolated from fraction III showed the resolution of two structurally related compounds, whereas that of the spot from fraction V showed the presence of one compound. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron impact mass spectrometry produced sufficient evidence to identify the isolated compounds as (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and gallic acid. These compounds accounted for about 10.5 and 1.7% of the dry mass of the crude extracts and meal, respectively.",1

"Antioxidant properties of roasted coffee residues The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.",1

"Characterization and quantitation of antioxidant constituents of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.",1
"Comparison of antioxidant activity, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics of three native fresh and sun-dried date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) varieties grown in Oman Fresh and sun-dried dates of three native varieties from Oman, namely, Fard, Khasab, and Khalas, were examined for their antioxidant activity and total contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics, as well as free and bound phenolic acids. All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation (n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good source of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents of anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids (1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free phenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during sun-drying.",1
"Antioxidant phenols in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flour: comparative spectrophotometric study among extraction methods of free and bound phenolic compounds Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices (absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts (scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.",0
"Pomegranate ellagitannin-derived metabolites inhibit prostate cancer growth and localize to the mouse prostate gland Our group has shown in a phase II clinical trial that pomegranate juice (PJ) increases prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in prostate cancer (CaP) patients with a rising PSA. Ellagitannins (ETs) are the most abundant polyphenols present in PJ and contribute greatly towards its reported biological properties. On consumption, ETs hydrolyze to release ellagic acid (EA), which is then converted by gut microflora to 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b, d]pyran-6-one (urolithin A, UA) derivatives. Despite the accumulating knowledge of ET metabolism in animals and humans, there is no available data on the pharmacokinetics and tissue disposition of urolithins. Using a standardized ET-enriched pomegranate extract (PE), we sought to further define the metabolism and tissue distribution of ET metabolites. PE and UA (synthesized in our laboratory) were administered to C57BL/6 wild-type male mice, and metabolite levels in plasma and tissues were determined over 24 h. ET metabolites were concentrated at higher levels in mouse prostate, colon, and intestinal tissues as compared to other tissues after administration of PE or UA. We also evaluated the effects of PE on CaP growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice injected subcutaneously with human CaP cells (LAPC-4). PE significantly inhibited LAPC-4 xenograft growth in SCID mice as compared to vehicle control. Finally, EA and several synthesized urolithins were shown to inhibit the growth of human CaP cells in vitro. The chemopreventive potential of pomegranate ETs and localization of their bioactive metabolites in mouse prostate tissue suggest that pomegranate may play a role in CaP treatment and chemoprevention. This warrants future human tissue bioavailability studies and further clinical studies in men with CaP.",1
"Chronic dietary intake of plant-derived anthocyanins protects the rat heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human health.",1
"Urinary excretion of phenolic acids in rats fed cranberry Dietary flavonoids can be converted into phenolic acids by colonic microflora. Phenolic acids can then be absorbed into the circulation and may contribute to the health-promoting effects of the parent compounds. Phenolic acids can be further metabolized in other tissues via methylation and conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. The objectives of this study were to identify and quantify the urinary excretion of 19 phenolic acids and their conjugates in rats fed three levels of a concentrated cranberry powder (3.3, 6.6, and 33 mg/kg of diet). The basic diet used was AIN93G diet containing very low amounts of any polyphenolic compounds. Of the phenolic acids studied, the amounts excreted varied by 4 orders of magnitude, with hippuric acid being excreted in the highest quantities. Amounts of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (3HPPA), and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4HCA) excreted were in the range of 18-33 microg/mg creatinine in animals fed the highest level of cranberry powder, whereas phenylacetic acid (PAA), gallic acid (GA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (34HPAA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (34HBA), 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (34HCA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (FA) were excreted in the urine in concentrations of 0.1-2 microg/mg creatinine. As the amount of cranberry in the diet was increased, the amount of 4HPAA excreted decreased but the percentage of conjugated 4HPAA excreted increased (from 57 to 91%). For other phenolic acids analyzed, the percentage excreted in the conjugated form was approximately constant across levels of cranberry in the diet and ranged from 65 to 100% for the individual phenolic acids. Studies of bioactivity and health effects need to consider more than just the compound(s) in the food, because they can be metabolized to other lower molecular weight compounds, which in turn may also be methylated or conjugated in some form that may affect the perceived health effects.",1
"Bioavailability of trans-resveratrol from red wine in humans Many in vitro studies demonstrated significant biological effects of trans-resveratrol. Thus, understanding the rate of intestinal absorption and metabolization in vivo of trans-resveratrol is the prerequisite to evaluate its potential health impact. Bioavailability studies mainly in animals or in humans using the pure compound at very high doses were performed. In this work, trans-resveratrol bioavailability from a moderate consumption of red wine in 25 healthy humans has been studied by three different experiments. The wine ingestion was associated to three different dietary approaches: fasting, a standard meal, a meal with high and low amount of lipids. Trans-resveratrol 3- and 4'-glucuronides were synthesized, purified, and characterized as pure standards. Bioavailability data were obtained by measuring the concentration of free, 3-glucuronide and 4'-glucuronide trans-resveratrol by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), both with ultraviolet (UV) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection, in serum samples taken at different times after red wine administration. Free trans-resveratrol was found, in trace amounts, only in some serum samples collected 30 min after red wine ingestion while after longer times resveratrol glucuronides predominated. Trans-resveratrol bioavailability was shown to be independent from the meal or its lipid content. The finding in human serum of trans-resveratrol glucuronides, rather than the free form of the compound, with a high interindividual variability, raises some doubts about the health effects of dietary resveratrol consumption and suggests that the benefits associated to red wine consumption could be probably due to the whole antioxidant pool present in red wine.",0

"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content in leaf extracts of tree spinach (Cnidoscolus spp.) Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of two tree spinach species (Cnidoscolus chayamansa McVaugh and C. aconitifolius Miller.) were determined in raw and cooked leaf extracts. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts. The results of this study indicate that tree spinach leaves are a rich source of natural antioxidants for foods.",0

"Isoflavones in human breast milk and other biological fluids We established a method for using HPLC and diode-array ultraviolet scanning to quantitate soy isoflavonoids in foods and in human plasma, urine, and breast milk. The analytes occurring as glycoside conjugates were hydrolyzed enzymatically before HPLC analysis if extracted from biological matrices or were subjected to direct HPLC analysis after extraction from foods. We monitored the isoflavones daidzein, genistein, glycitein, formononetin, and biochanin-A and their mammalian metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin in human plasma, urine, and breast milk. Analytes were identified by absorbance patterns, fluorometric and electrochemical detection. and comparison with internal and external standards. In addition, we identified analytes by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after trimethylsilylation. The HPLC method was also used to measure concentrations of isoflavones and their glucoside conjugates in various soy-based infant formulas. Total isoflavone concentrations varied between 155 and 281 mg/kg. After one woman received a moderate challenge with 20 g roasted soybeans (equivalent to 37 mg isoflavones), we detected mean total isoflavone concentrations of approximately 2.0 micromol/L in plasma, 0.2 micromol/L in breast milk, and 3.0 micromol/h in urine. According to our measurements, with adjustment for body weight, isoflavonoid exposure is 4-6 times higher in infants fed soy-based formula than in adults eating a diet rich in soyfoods (approximately 30 g/d). Implications of the presented results for the potential cancer-preventing activity of isoflavones by exposing newborn infants to these phytochemicals are discussed.",0

"Alkylresorcinols in cereals and cereal products The alkylresorcinol (AR) content of 8 commonly consumed cereals, 125 Triticum cultivars, milling fractions of wheat and rye, bread, and other cereal products was analyzed. ARs were found in wheat (489-1429 microgram/g), rye (720-761 microgram/g), triticale (439-647 microgram/g), and barley (42-51 microgram/g), but not in rice, oats, maize, sorghum, or millet. One durum wheat variety was found to have an exceptionally low level of ARs (54 microgram/g) compared to other durum wheat varieties (589-751 microgram/g) and Triticumspecies analyzed. The AR content of milling fractions closely followed the ash content and could be used as a marker of the presence of bran in flour. Using hot 1-propanol extraction, all ARs could be extracted from bread, contrary to previous studies which suggested that ARs were destroyed during baking. Cereal products varied greatly in AR content, with those containing wheat bran or whole rye having the highest content.",1

"Metabolism of the soy isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein in human subjects. Identification of new metabolites having an intact isoflavonoid skeleton Epidemiological studies have associated high soy intake with a lowered risk for certain hormone-dependent diseases. Soy and soy foods are rich sources of isoflavones, which have been shown to possess several biological activities. In this study, the metabolism of soy isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein was investigated in human subjects. The aim was to find and identify urinary phase I metabolites of isoflavones, which have an intact isoflavonoid skeleton, and which might possess some bioactivity. Six volunteers included three soy bars per day into their normal western diet for a 2-week period. Daily urine samples were collected before, and after the supplementation period. Urine samples were hydrolyzed with Helix pomatia, extracted with diethyl ether, purified with Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, and analyzed as trimethylsilyl derivatives using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The structures of the isoflavone metabolites were identified using authentic reference compounds. The metabolites, for which authentic reference compounds were not available, were identified by the interpretation of mass spectra. Several new isoflavone metabolites were identified, and the presence of previously reported metabolites confirmed. The metabolic pathways of daidzein, genistein and glycitein are presented on the basis of the identification of the metabolites in human urine after soy supplementation.",1
"Influence of storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation in potato tubers (Solanum tuburosum L.) The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.",1

"Urinary excretion of olive oil phenols and their metabolites in humans We have recently demonstrated, in humans, the bioavailability of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol; HT), one of the major antioxidant components of virgin olive oil. In particular, we reported that this compound is present in lipoproteins involved in atherosclerotic processes and is excreted in the urine mainly as glucuronide-conjugate. The aim of the present study was to elucidate, in humans, the metabolic fate of HT after ingestion of virgin olive oil. After administration of virgin olive oil, 24-hour urine collections of healthy volunteers were prepared for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses in order to identify and quantify HT and its metabolites homovanillic alcohol (HVA1c) and homovanillic acid (HVA). The results indicate that this compound undergoes the action of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), enzymes involved in the catecholamine catabolism, resulting in an enhanced excretion of HVA1c. We also found a significant increase of HVA, indicating an oxidation of the ethanolic residue of HT and/or of HVA1c in humans. The excretion of both metabolites significantly correlated with the dose of administered HT.",1
"Quantitative analysis of plasma caffeic and ferulic acid equivalents by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid (FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites (sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.",0

"Phyto-oestrogen database of foods and average intake in Finland Information on phyto-oestrogen intake in various populations has been scanty until now, primarily because data on the content of these compounds in foods were lacking. We report here on expansion of the Finnish National Food Composition Database (Fineli) with values for the plant lignans matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. The values, expressed as aglycones, were based on food analyses (mainly GC-MS) or imputed from analytical data for 180 foods for lignans and 160 foods for isoflavones; additionally, over 1000 values were derived from the recipe database of Fineli. Average intake of these phyto-oestrogens was calculated using food consumption data of the National Dietary Survey FINDIET 1997, which was carried out in a random sample of the adult population in five areas in Finland. The dietary data were collected by 24 h recall =2862). The mean lignan intake was 434 (standard deviation (SD) 1575) microg/d and the mean isoflavone intake was 788 (SD 673) microg/d. Women had a higher lignan density (microg lignans/MJ) in their diet than men (P<0.05). Men had a higher mean daily isoflavone intake, 902 (SD 368) microg, than women, 668 (SD 963) microg (P<0.05). The sources of lignans were many: seeds, cereals, fruit, berries and vegetables. The main sources of isoflavones appeared to be processed meat products/sausages containing soya as an ingredient, and legumes as such. The average intake of lignans and isoflavones in Finland seems to be low, but intake varies throughout the population.",1
"Effect of postharvest storage and processing on the antioxidant constituents (flavonoids and vitamin C) of fresh-cut spinach The effect of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and cooking on the flavonoids and vitamin C content (ascorbic + dehydroascorbic acid; AA + DHAA) of fresh-cut spinach was evaluated. The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in MAP.",1
"Identification of metabolites of (-)-epicatechin gallate and their metabolic fate in the rat After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' '-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate orally administered to the rat is proposed.",0
"Quercetin pharmacokinetics in humans The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.",1
Fast analysis of soy isoflavones by high-performance liquid chromatography with monolithic columns A fast method using high-performance liquid chromatography based on two monolithic columns has been developed for the simultaneous determination of isoflavones extracted from soybeans and derived foods. The 12 main isoflavones were resolved in 10 min in two coupled monolithic columns working at 35 degrees C using a elution gradient of acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) and methanol (0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1). Retention time and relative area standard deviations were below 1% for all isoflavones. The method developed was successfully applied to several soy food samples and spiked samples. Total isoflavone concentration in sampled soy foods ranged from 34.28 mg L(-1) to 4.29 mg g(-1).,1
"Phenolic composition of champagnes from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vintages Nineteen phenolic compounds including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, phenolic alcohols, and phenolic aldehydes have been identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines.",1
"Nondestructive determination of lignans and lignan glycosides in sesame seeds by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 (coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs for high quality sesame.",0
"Investigations on anthocyanins in wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Pinotage: factors influencing the formation of pinotin A and its correlation with wine age Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely.

"Epicatechin, procyanidins, and phenolic microbial metabolites after cocoa intake in humans and rats Proanthocyanidins, flavonoids exhibiting cardiovascular protection, constitute a major fraction of the flavonoid ingested in the human diet. Although they are poorly absorbed, they are metabolized by the intestinal microbiota into various phenolic acids. An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive measurement of a large number of metabolites in a very short run time, which makes it ideal for use in epidemiological studies.",1
"Urinary excretion of lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens in Japanese men and women consuming a traditional Japanese diet Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due to the high intake of soybean products.",0

"Content, composition, and stereochemical characterisation of lignans in berries and seeds In seed extracts of five oilseed species, in bran extracts of three cereal species, and in seed and/or whole berry extracts of 10 berry species, the concentrations of a large number of lignans and the enantiomeric composition of selected lignans were determined. In the case of sesame and hemp seeds, the lignan content and composition of the whole seeds was compared to that of the hulled seeds. The results showed that cloudberry seeds are the third most lignan-rich food source after linseeds and whole sesame seeds, and that most of the berry species analysed were more lignan-rich than the cereal brans. The lignans are concentrated in the hull of the oilseeds and in the seeds of the berries. In most samples, secoisolarici-, pino-, medio-, and syringaresinol were present as a mixture of two enantiomers.",1
"Interaction of vitamin C and flavonoids in elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) during juice processing A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of ascorbic acid.",0

"Effect of roasting on the formation of chlorogenic acid lactones in coffee Of all plant constituents, coffee has one of the highest concentrations of chlorogenic acids. When roasting coffee, some of these are transformed into chlorogenic acid lactones (CGL). We have studied the formation of CGL during the roasting of coffee beans in Coffea arabica cv. Bourbon; C. arabicacv. Longberry; and C. canephora cv. Robusta. Individual CGL levels were determined by comparison of HPLC peaks with those of synthetic CGL standards. Seven CGL were identified: 3-caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-CQL), 4- caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-CQL), 3-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-pCoQL), 4-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-pCoQL), 3-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-FQL), 4-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-FQL), and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-diCQL). 3-CQL was the most abundant lactone in C. arabica and C. canephora, reaching peak values of 230 +/- 9 and 254 +/- 4 mg/100 g (dry weight), respectively, at light medium roast ( approximately 14% weight loss). 4-CQL was the second most abundant lactone (116 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 mg/100 g, respectively. The maximum amount of CGL represents approximately 30% of the available precursors. The relative levels of 3-CQL and 4-CQL in roasted coffee were reverse to those of their precursors in green coffee. This suggests that roasting causes isomerization of chlorogenic acids prior to the formation of lactones and that the levels of lactones in roasted coffee do not reflect the levels of precursors in green coffee.",0
"Phenolic compounds and squalene in olive oils: the concentration and antioxidant potential of total phenols, simple phenols, secoiridoids, lignans and squalene The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic antioxidant and squalene content in a range of olive and seed oils. A mean of 290 +/- 38 (SEM) mg squalene/100 g was detected. However, while there was a weak significant difference between extra virgin (424 +/- 21 mg/kg) and refined virgin (340 +/- 31 mg/100 g; P<0.05) olive oils, highly significant differences were evident between extra virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) refined virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) and seed oils (24 +/- 5 mg/100 g). While seed oils were devoid, on average, the olive oils contained 196 +/- 19 mg/kg total phenolics as judged by HPLC analysis, but the value for extra virgin (232 +/- 15 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that of refined virgin olive oil (62 +/- 12 mg/kg; P<0.0001). Appreciable quantities of simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) were detected in olive oils, with significant differences between extravirgin (41.87 +/- 6.17) and refined virgin olive oils (4.72 +/- 215; P<0.01). The major linked phenols were secoiridoids and lignans. Although extra virgin contained higher concentrations of secoiridoids (27.72 +/- 6.84) than refined olive oils (9.30 +/- 3.81) this difference was not significant. On the other hand, the concentration of lignans was significantly higher (P<0.001) in extra virgin (41.53 +/- 3.93) compared to refined virgin olive oils (7.29 +/- 2.56). All classes of phenolics were shown to be potent antioxidants. In future epidemiologic studies, both the nature and source of olive oil consumed should be differentiated in ascertaining cancer risk.",1
"Proanthocyanidin composition in the seed coat of lentils (Lens culinaris L.) Lentils (Lens culinaris L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, little is known about their phenolic composition. Because polyphenols in lentils are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in this part of the tissue. The use of C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization (mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was (+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to nonamers constitute the polymer fraction. The most abundant proanthocyanidins in the seed coat of lentils are the polymers (65-75%), with a mDP of 7-9, followed by the oligomers (20-30%), with a mDP of 4-5.",1
The effect of postharvest ripening on strawberry bioactive composition and antioxidant potential The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv.

"Method for determining the content of catechins in tea infusions by high-performance liquid chromatography A high-performance liquid chromatography method employing diode array detection was developed to determine levels of the major catechins present in black, green, and Jasmine tea infusions. Reversed-phase separations were performed on a C18 column using three gradients: acetonitrile-acetate buffer, methanol-acetate buffer, and acetonitrile-acetate buffer with ascorbic acid. The identities of the tea catechins were established by comparing absorbance spectra and retention times to reference standards chromatographed under identical conditions. Epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate were found in all the tea infusions examined, ranging in concentration from 1-13 mg dl-1. These levels indicate that even moderate tea consumption can contribute a substantial quantity of flavanols to the diet. Although some differences between the three brewed teas were evident, all were comparably good sources of these catechins.",0

"Flavonoids in Pigmented Orange Juice and Second-Pressure Extracts Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from SPEs was proposed.",1
"Effects of different cooking methods on antioxidant profile, antioxidant capacity, and physical characteristics of artichoke In this study, the effects of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on the artichoke phenolic compounds pattern were evaluated by LC-MS/MS analysis. The variation of carotenoids, antioxidant capacity, and artichoke physical properties after cooking was also investigated. The major phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.",1
"Determination of free phenolic acids in wort and beer by coulometric array detection The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.",1
Bioavailability and catabolism of green tea flavan-3-ols in humans The aim of this study was to investigate green tea flavan-3-ol catabolism and plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to evaluate their absolute bioavailability by taking into account all known and some unknown catabolites deriving from their interaction with the gastrointestinal tract and its host microflora.,1
"Quantitative analysis of flavan-3-ols in Spanish foodstuffs and beverages An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, medlar, grape, and tea.",1
"Metabolism of the soy isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein in human subjects. Identification of new metabolites having an intact isoflavonoid skeleton Epidemiological studies have associated high soy intake with a lowered risk for certain hormone-dependent diseases. Soy and soy foods are rich sources of isoflavones, which have been shown to possess several biological activities. In this study, the metabolism of soy isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein was investigated in human subjects. The aim was to find and identify urinary phase I metabolites of isoflavones, which have an intact isoflavonoid skeleton, and which might possess some bioactivity. Six volunteers included three soy bars per day into their normal western diet for a 2-week period. Daily urine samples were collected before, and after the supplementation period. Urine samples were hydrolyzed with Helix pomatia, extracted with diethyl ether, purified with Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, and analyzed as trimethylsilyl derivatives using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The structures of the isoflavone metabolites were identified using authentic reference compounds. The metabolites, for which authentic reference compounds were not available, were identified by the interpretation of mass spectra. Several new isoflavone metabolites were identified, and the presence of previously reported metabolites confirmed. The metabolic pathways of daidzein, genistein and glycitein are presented on the basis of the identification of the metabolites in human urine after soy supplementation.",0
"Phenol antioxidant quantity and quality in food : fruits The free and bound phenols have been measured in 20 fruits commonly consumed in the American diet. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with catechin as the standard after correction for ascorbic acid contribution. On a fresh weight basis, cranberry had the highest total phenols, and was distantly followed by red grape. Free and total phenol quality in the fruits was analyzed by using the inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation promoted by cupric ion. Ascorbate had only a minor contribution to the antioxidants in fruits with the exception of melon, nectarine, orange, white grape, and strawberry. The fruit extracts' antioxidant quality was better than the vitamin antioxidants and most pure phenols, suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. Using our assay, fruits had significantly better quantity and quality of phenol antioxidants than vegetables. Fruits, specifically apples and cranberries, have phenol antioxidants that can enrich lower density lipoproteins and protect them from oxidation. The average per capita consumption of fruit phenols in the U.S. is estimated to be 255 mg/day of catechin equivalents.",1
"Curcumin content of turmeric and curry powders Curcumin, derived from the rhizome curcuma longa, is one of the primary ingredients in turmeric and curry powders that are used as spices in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, especially on the Indian subcontinent. More recently, laboratory studies have demonstrated that dietary curcumin exhibits various biological activities and significantly inhibits colon tumorigenesis and tumor size in animals. Curcumin displays both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, giving it the potential to be considered in the development of cancer preventive strategies and applications in clinical research. Experimental studies have shown the biological activities of the compound, but much more information on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and food content are needed. Whether the amount of curcumin in turmeric and curry powders is sufficient to suggest effects on biological activities and cancer risk is unknown. To determine and compare the quantitative amounts of curcumin that are present in several brands of turmeric and curry powders, a high performance liquid chromatography technique was used to analyze 28 spice products described as turmeric or curry powders and two negative controls. Pure turmeric powder had the highest curcumin concentration, averaging 3.14% by weight. The curry powder samples, with one exception, had relatively small amounts of curcumin present, and the variability in content was great. The curcumin content of these seasoning products that are consumed as a component of the diet should be considered in evaluating baseline tissue concentration and response to curcumin supplementation, which is under study in chemoprevention trials.",0

"Determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids of apple and pear by high-performance liquid chromatography A new HPLC stationary phase has been applied to the analysis of phenolic acids and flavonoids with diode array and mass spectrometric detection. The separation of 26 standard compounds was achieved within 1 h. The stationary phase displayed excellent resolution especially of flavonol glycosides. The analytical system has been used for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple pomace and apple juice, and in extracts of pear fruits of different cultivars. Apple pomace was found to be a promising source of phenolics. However, yields are affected by the drying conditions applied. Furthermore, the applicability of the analytical system for the authenticity control of apple and pear juice was demonstrated by determination of characteristic quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosides, and dihydrochalcones, respectively. Since isorhamnetin-3-glucoside was present in all pear cultivars investigated, the usefulness of arbutin as a specific marker of pear products appears to be doubtful.",0

The highest total flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots (1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves (30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg).

In vegetables, quercetin glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are also present. Fruits contain almost exclusively quercetin glycosides, whereas kaempferol and myricetin glycosides are found only in trace quantities.",0
"Piceid, the major resveratrol derivative in grape juices The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink wine.",1

"Antioxidant activity of grains Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of whole grains and grain-based products is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. The health benefits of whole grains are attributed in part to their unique phytochemical composition. However, the phytochemical contents in grains have been commonly underestimated in the literature, because bound phytochemicals were not included. This study was designed to investigate the complete phytochemical profiles in free, soluble conjugated, and insoluble bound forms, as well as their antioxidant activities in uncooked whole grains. Corn had the highest total phenolic content (15.55 +/- 0.60 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain) of the grains tested, followed by wheat (7.99 +/- 0.39 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain), oats (6.53 +/- 0.19 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain), and rice (5.56 +/- 0.17 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain). The major portion of phenolics in grains existed in the bound form (85% in corn, 75% in oats and wheat, and 62% in rice), although free phenolics were frequently reported in the literature. Ferulic acid was the major phenolic compound in grains tested, with free, soluble-conjugated, and bound ferulic acids present in the ratio 0.1:1:100. Corn had the highest total antioxidant activity (181.42 +/- 0.86 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), followed by wheat (76.70 +/- 1.38 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), oats (74.67 +/- 1.49 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), and rice (55.77 +/- 1.62 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain). Bound phytochemicals were the major contributors to the total antioxidant activity: 90% in wheat, 87% in corn, 71% in rice, and 58% in oats. Bound phytochemicals could survive stomach and intestinal digestion to reach the colon. This may partly explain the mechanism of grain consumption in the prevention of colon cancer, other digestive cancers, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, which is supported by epidemiological studies.",1
"Simultaneous determination of daidzein, equol, genistein and bisphenol A in human urine by a fast and simple method using SPE and GC-MS Human diet contains weakly estrogenic compounds such as daidzein (DAI) and genistein (GEN), phytoestrogens present in soy and many vegetables as well as bisphenol A (BPA), a contaminant from packing materials and plastic containers for foods and beverages. In light of concerns about hormonally active agents, biomonitoring methods are needed to assess human exposure to such compounds. A method for simultaneous determination of DAI, its metabolite equol (EQ), GEN, and BPA by GC-MS analysis was established, validated and applied to measure concentrations in human urine. Sample preparation involves enzymatic conjugate cleavage, SPE and derivatization by silylation. For GC/MS analysis, deuterated DAI and GEN and( 13)C-BPA are used as internal standards. LOD are 4, 4, 5 and 3 ng/mL urine for DAI, EQ, GEN and BPA, respectively. Interassay variations were 9% for DAI, 15% for EQ, 18% for GEN and 10% for BPA. Simple workup and accuracy of the method are suited for biomonitoring. An analysis of urine samples from 15 adults consuming typical German food revealed dietary exposure to phytoestrogens in all samples: GEN concentrations ranged between 13 and 238 ng/mL, those for DAI ranged from 12 to 356 ng/mL. More than half of the individuals excreted also the more estrogenic metabolite EQ, at levels of 8-128 ng/mL. Higher concentrations (GEN: 820, DAI: 960 and EQ: 1740 ng/mL) were measured in a 24 h urine sample upon ingestion of soy protein (50 g with 12.9 mg DAI and 25.2 mg GEN). Only urine collected after some days on strict phytoestrogen-free diet had undetectable isoflavone levels. BPA was detected in 9 of 15 urine samples ranging from 3 to 11 ng/mL, and at 55 ng/mL in one sample. In conclusion, a reliable method to determine BPA and isoflavones in urine was established and applied in a pilot study: Biomonitoring results show much higher dietary exposure to phytoestrogens than to BPA in German adults.",1
"Comparative content of some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats The aim of this study was to compare some bioactive compounds in apples, peaches and pears and their influence on lipids and antioxidant capacity in rats. The content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 +/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 ). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and other diseases.",1
"Characterization of Phenolic Profiles of Northern European Berries by Capillary Electrophoresis and Determination of their Antioxidant Activity Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, and morin.",0
"trans-Resveratrol, quercetin, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin content in south Italian monovarietal wines: relationship with maceration time and marc pressing during winemaking The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese was observed.",0
"Analysis of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in juice beverages using high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric array detection Analysis of phenolics and flavonoids in juice beverages using reversed-phase HPLC with coulometric array detection is described. Sixteen serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line resolution of co-eluting compounds and generation of voltammetric data. Within each class of compounds, oxidation potential corresponded to specific substitution patterns where: catechol < methoxycatechol < monohydroxyl < methoxyl. Twenty-seven standard compounds were resolved in a 45-min run. The limits of detection were in the low ng/ml range with a linear response range of at least three orders of magnitude. Intra-run retention time variation was < 1% (R.S.D.) and adjacent sensor response ratios varied by < 5% (R.S.D.). The utility of this technique in generating multivariate data for differentiation of juices and juice mixtures is shown.",1

"Phlorin screening in various citrus species and varieties Phlorin (3,5-dihydroxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside), an orange peel marker, has been searched in 45 species and varieties of Citrus. The phlorin content was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography in juices and aqueous peel extracts of these different fruits. The phlorin content in C. reticulata peel extract varies from 0 to 1012 mg L(-)(1) with a mean of 162 mg L(-)(1). On the contrary, phlorin was not found in mandarin and clementine juices except for mandarin ""Commune"" and ""Beauty"" (33 and 30 mg L(-)(1), respectively). In the 14 species of oranges and varieties, phlorin was detected in juices and peel extracts with a mean of 22 and 492 mg L(-)(1), respectively, while for grapefruits, means were 108 mg L(-)(1) in juices and 982 mg L(-)(1) for peel extracts. Tangors and tangelos which are hybrids (C. reticulata x C. sinensis and C. reticulata x C. paradisi, respectively) are characterized by the systematic presence of phlorin in peels (mean: 406 and 659 mg L(-)(1), respectively) while in juices its presence could be variable (0-73 mg L(-)(1)). These heterogeneity and values may be explained by the genetic variability of these hybrids and the phlorin content of their parentage group.",0
"Isoflavones in human breast milk and other biological fluids We established a method for using HPLC and diode-array ultraviolet scanning to quantitate soy isoflavonoids in foods and in human plasma, urine, and breast milk. The analytes occurring as glycoside conjugates were hydrolyzed enzymatically before HPLC analysis if extracted from biological matrices or were subjected to direct HPLC analysis after extraction from foods. We monitored the isoflavones daidzein, genistein, glycitein, formononetin, and biochanin-A and their mammalian metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin in human plasma, urine, and breast milk. Analytes were identified by absorbance patterns, fluorometric and electrochemical detection. and comparison with internal and external standards. In addition, we identified analytes by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after trimethylsilylation. The HPLC method was also used to measure concentrations of isoflavones and their glucoside conjugates in various soy-based infant formulas. Total isoflavone concentrations varied between 155 and 281 mg/kg. After one woman received a moderate challenge with 20 g roasted soybeans (equivalent to 37 mg isoflavones), we detected mean total isoflavone concentrations of approximately 2.0 micromol/L in plasma, 0.2 micromol/L in breast milk, and 3.0 micromol/h in urine. According to our measurements, with adjustment for body weight, isoflavonoid exposure is 4-6 times higher in infants fed soy-based formula than in adults eating a diet rich in soyfoods (approximately 30 g/d). Implications of the presented results for the potential cancer-preventing activity of isoflavones by exposing newborn infants to these phytochemicals are discussed.",1
"Phenolic composition of kiwifruit juice Phenolic compounds in kiwifruit pulp were separated and characterized by reversed-phase HPLC, and the effect of juice processing on the phenolic composition was studied. Fractionation of phenolic compounds was achieved through selective elution from C-18 cartridges prior to preconcentration and subsequent separation by HPLC. Strongly acidic compounds were identified as derivatives of coumaric and caffeic acids, including chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and a derivative of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The weakly acidic fraction contained epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins (B3, B2, or B4 and oligomers). Flavonols were present as the glycosides of quercetin (glucoside, rhamnoside, and rutinoside) and kaempferol (rhamnoside and rutinoside). Phenolic compounds were present, at levels of <1-7 mg/L, in clarified juice. The concentration of phenolics was highest after high-temperature short-time treatment (HTST) of juice. Hydrolysis of hydroxycinnamic acids occurred after enzyme addition and HTST treatment. The flavonol glycoside composition is the best identifier of kiwifruit juice.",1
"Simultaneous determination of multiple constituents in real beer samples of different origins by capillary zone electrophoresis Simultaneous determination of alcohols, amines, amino acids, flavonoids, and purine and pyrimidine bases in bottled beer samples directly without any pre-treatment was carried out by capillary zone electrophoresis with diode-array detection. Electrolyte conditions such as pH, composition and concentration of the buffer, working voltage and type and time of injection were checked. The best separation of the cited analytes was achieved in 70 mM sodium borate solution and pH 10.25. The detection limits were from 2.1 to 5.6 mg L(-1) for the 18 compounds studied. The developed method is rapid, sensitive and quantitative and has been applied to seven types of international bottled beers of different origins bought locally.",0
"Electrophoretic identification and quantitation of compounds in the polyphenolic fraction of extra-virgin olive oil A capillary zone electrophoresis method has been carried out to determine and quantitate some compounds of the polyphenolic fraction of virgin olive oil which have never previously been determined before using capillary electrophoresis, such as elenolic acid, ligstroside aglycon, oleuropein aglycon, and (+)-pinoresinol. The compounds were identified using standards obtained by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A detailed method optimization was performed to separate the phenolic compounds present in olive oil using a methanol-water extract of Picual extra-virgin olive oil, and different extraction systems were compared (C18-solid phase extraction (SPE), Diol-SPE, Sax-SPE and liquid-liquid extraction). The optimized parameters were 30 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.3) at 25 kV with 8 s hydrodynamic injection, and the quantitation was carried out by the use of two reference compounds at two different wavelengths.",1
"Absorption and pharmacokinetics of grapefruit flavanones in beagles The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide (medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 (0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l (14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin glucuronide. The median and range values for mean residence time were 3.3 (1.5-9.3), 2.8 (0.8-11.2) and 8.0 (2.3-13.1) h for naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, respectively. The results of the present study demonstrate the absorption of grapefruit flavanones via the presence of their metabolites in plasma, thus making an important contribution to the field since the biological activities ascribed to these compounds rely on their specific forms of absorption.",1
"Bioavailability of anthocyanins from purple carrot juice: effects of acylation and plant matrix Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.",0
