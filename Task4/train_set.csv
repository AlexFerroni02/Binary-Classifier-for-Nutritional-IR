Significant reduction in tannin contents was observed after soaking the lentils in simple water or salt solutions of different concentrations. Soaking in sodium bicarbonate solution was the most effective way to reduce the tannin content. Cooking lentils also further reduced tannin and improved protein digestibility.,1
"Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous and lens. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BCAs were absorbed and distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier in both rats and rabbits.",1
"The polyphenolic components of Idared and Shampion apple purées were determined by HPLC; chlorogenic acid was the most abundant acid (20.0mg/100g in microwaved Idared); other polyphenols identified in high concentrations included (−)-epicatechin, procyanidin B1 and B2; quercetin and cyanidin glycosides were found in minor concentrations. The Shampion purées had higher total phenolics (142mg/100g) and procyanidin B2 concentrations (17.3mg/100g) than the Idared ones, and polymeric procyanidins represented 41% of all polyphenols. Antioxidant capacities of the samples, determined by spectrophotometric methods and EPR spectroscopy, correlated well with the concentration of polyphenols. The antioxidant properties could be better represented by EPR than by UV–vis measurements. The latter require transparent (clear) samples whereas EPR can be a method of choice in the assessment of radical-scavenging activity of dense and cloudy apple purées. Our results support the putative high antioxidant value of apple purées and define their capacity in terms of the major constituents. Apple purées are a rich source of natural antioxidants, especially of chlorogenic acid and procyanidins.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent form of pediatric leukemia. The gut microbiome (GM) is crucial for proper nutrition, immunity, and biological conflict. Since the relationship between ALL and GM is bidirectional, ALL occurrence and treatment are closely related to GM destruction and the development of impaired immunity. Studies have discovered significant GM alterations in patients with ALL, including decreased diversity, that are likely directly caused by the development of ALL. Chemotherapy, antibiotic therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are the mainstays of treatment for pediatric ALL. These approaches affect the composition, diversity, and abundance of intestinal microorganisms, which in turn affects therapeutic efficiency and can cause a variety of complications. Modulating the GM can aid the recovery of patients with ALL. This article discusses the various treatment modalities for pediatric ALL and their corresponding effects on the GM, as well as the changes in the GM that occur in children with ALL from diagnosis to treatment. Gaining a greater understanding of the link between ALL and the GM is expected to help improve treatment for pediatric ALL in the future.",0
"The alkylresorcinol (AR) content of 8 commonly consumed cereals, 125 Triticum cultivars, milling fractions of wheat and rye, bread, and other cereal products was analyzed. ARs were found in wheat (489-1429 microgram/g), rye (720-761 microgram/g), triticale (439-647 microgram/g), and barley (42-51 microgram/g), but not in rice, oats, maize, sorghum, or millet. One durum wheat variety was found to have an exceptionally low level of ARs (54 microgram/g) compared to other durum wheat varieties (589-751 microgram/g) and Triticumspecies analyzed. The AR content of milling fractions closely followed the ash content and could be used as a marker of the presence of bran in flour. Using hot 1-propanol extraction, all ARs could be extracted from bread, contrary to previous studies which suggested that ARs were destroyed during baking. Cereal products varied greatly in AR content, with those containing wheat bran or whole rye having the highest content.",1
"Currently there is high interest in phytochemicals as bioactive components of food. The phenolic compounds act as antioxidants, which is beneficial for the human body, since phenolics are oxidised in preference to other cellular components and tissues, thus preventing cell damage and aging. Fruits are particularly rich in phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity, and therefore, the fruits juices are also naturally rich in these compounds. However, this type of component is somewhat susceptible to thermal degradation, and hence the effects of processing, like pasteurization, are of wide interest. The aim of this review is to focus on the effect of processing and storage over these compounds, such as thermal pasteurization, pulsed electric fields, high pressure, ultrasound, microwave treatment, microfiltration, refrigeration and freezing .",1
"B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is a frequent type of childhood hematological malignancy. The disease is classified into several subtypes according to genetic abnormalities. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in pathological processes (e.g., proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation). A miRNA is a group of short non-coding RNAs with relevant regulatory effects on gene expression achieved by suppression of the translation or degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA). These molecules act as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes in the pathogenesis of pediatric leukemias. The characteristic features of miRNAs are their stable form and the possibility of secretion to the circulatory system. The role of miRNA in BCP-ALL pathogenesis is still emerging, but several studies have suggested using miRNA expression profiles as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to therapy in leukemia. The dysregulation of some miRNAs involved in childhood acute lymphoid leukemia, such as miR-155, miR-200c, miR-100, miR-181a, miR125b, and miR146a is discussed, showing their possible employment as therapeutic targets. In the current review, the capabilities of miRNAs in non-invasive diagnostics and their prognostic potential as biomarkers are presented.",0
"Alkylresorcinol (AR) content was determined in multiple-stage whole wheat and whole rye flour sours, as well as in whole wheat and whole rye flour doughs and breads. AR content decreased considerably during fermentation and baking. AR content was reduced by 20 and 46%, respectively, at the end of sourdough starter fermentation of whole wheat and whole rye flour sours. AR content, which was 512 and 210 μg/g in whole rye and whole wheat flour doughs, respectively, was 30 and 0 μg/g, respectively, after baking of breads. Synthetic AR added at different levels to doughs was also greatly reduced during fermentation and baking.",1
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) accounts for 85% of all childhood ALL. Malignancies exhaust T and B cells, resulting in an increased expression of immune checkpoint receptors (ICRs), such as T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3). TIM-3 has been found to be dysregulated in different types of cancer. However, there is a lack of rigorous studies on the TIM-3 expression in B-ALL. The current study aimed to measure the expression of TIM-3 at the gene and protein levels and evaluate the potential of TIM-3 as a biomarker in B-ALL. A total of 28 subjects were recruited between 2021 and 2023, comprising 18 subjects diagnosed with B-ALL and 10 non-malignant healthy controls. The B-ALL patients were divided into three groups: newly diagnosed (four patients), in remission (nine patients), and relapse/refractory (five patients). The expression levels of TIM-3 were evaluated using the real-time qPCR and ELISA techniques. The results revealed that the TIM-3 expression was significantly downregulated in the malignant B-ALL patients compared to the non-malignant healthy controls in the mRNA (FC = -1.058 ± 0.3548,",0
"The role of the complement system and its membrane-bound regulatory proteins (mCRPs) in the pathogenesis of cancer is still a debatable issue. The current study aimed to evaluate the role of the complement regulatory protein, the decay-accelerating factor (CD55), in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia. CD55 gene expression was assessed in the peripheral blood of 34 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 26 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 30 healthy controls by qRT-PCR. Also, CD55 gene knockdown was performed in HSB-2 (ALL cell line) using customized short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Flowcytometric analysis was done to ensure successful transfection, and MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cell viability post-transfection and silencing of CD55. There was a significant downregulation of CD55 in acute leukemia patients compared to the healthy controls (p < 0.001) with RQ values of AML, and ALL patients were 0.2499 ± 0.07427 and 0.2581 ± 0.09467, respectively. The MTT assay showed a significantly reduced viability of HSB-2 cells following posttranscriptional silencing of CD55 (p < 0.001) by 78.6% as compared to the non-transfected or mock-transfected cells. In the presence of human serum, there was a significant reduction in cell viability by 66.3% as compared to non-transfected controls (p = 0.01). Regarding the cells co-transfected with CD55 and CD46 silencing plasmids, cell viability was significantly decreased by 70.6% compared to non-transfected cells. CD55 was significantly downregulated in acute leukemia. However, its in vitro silencing showed significant reduction in cell viability, giving it a dual opposing role in cancer.",0
"A micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) method was developed for the qualitative and quantitative determination of five marker compounds (iridoid glycosides, flavonoids and phenylethanoids) in Verbena officinalis. Optimum separation was achieved using a 50 mM sodium borate solution (pH 9.3), containing 50 mM sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) as surfactant, at an applied voltage of 25 kV and a temperature of 30 °C, respectively. Because of their different absorption maxima, the compounds were detected either at 205 or 235 nm. Calibration data confirmed linearity of the detector response within the concentration range injected (R2 from 0.997 to 0.999), and revealed detection limits ranging from 5.0 μg mL−1 (verbascoside) to 13.6 μg mL−1 (hastatoside). The five markers were readily assignable in several samples of Verbena.",1
"In normal rye caryopses, five phenolic acids were detected: ferulic, sinapic, vanillic, caffeic and p-coumaric, three of which were found in the free phenolic fraction (p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic). Total phenolic compound and phenolic acid contents were the highest at the initial stage of development and the lowest at the final stage of maturation of rye grains. After the dehydration treatment, total phenolic content decreased relatively slightly in all examined samples of rye caryopses of various ripeness. The phenolic acid fraction (consisting of both bound and free forms) decreased more during dehydration, especially at the initial stage of caryopses development. Cells of unripe rye grains reacted to water stress by lowering the level of total phenolic compounds, and especially the content of phenolic acids. During the development and ripening of rye caryopses, a gradual increase in precocious germination ability of the grain was observed. The enforced dehydration stimulated processes of precocious germination of unripe caryopses. The highest stimulation of germination was observed at the initial stage of development of caryopses (22 and 29 DAF). One of the reasons for inducing faster germination of unripe rye caryopses may be the lowering of the level of phenolic acids (considered as inhibitors of germination) in caryopses after the dehydration treatment.",1
"The preventability of acute lymphocytic leukemia during childhood is currently receiving great attention, as it is one of the most common cancers in children. Among the known risk factors so far are those affecting the development of gut microbiota, such as a short duration or absence of breastfeeding, cesarean section, a diet lacking in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the use of antibiotics, absence of infection during infancy, and lack of pets, among other factors. Namely, it has been shown that iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and lack of vitamin D may cause intestinal dysbiosis, while at the same time, both increase the risk of hematological malignancies. The presence of IDA and vitamin D deficiency have been shown to lead to a decreased proportion of Firmicutes in stool, which could, as a consequence, lead to a deficit of butyrate. Moreover, children with IDA have increased blood concentrations of cadmium, which induces systemic inflammation and is linked to the onset of an inflammatory microenvironment in the bone marrow. Finally, IDA and Cd exposure increase fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) blood levels, which in turn suppresses vitamin D synthesis. A lack of vitamin D has been associated with a higher risk of ALL onset. In brief, as presented in this review, there are three independent ways in which IDA increases the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) appearance. These are: intestinal dysbiosis, disruption of vitamin D synthesis, and an increased Cd load, which has been linked to systemic inflammation. All of the aforementioned factors could generate the appearance of a second mutation, such as ETV6/RUNX1 (TEL-AML), leading to mutation homozygosity and the onset of disease. ALL has been observed in both IDA and thalassemia. However, as IDA is the most common type of anemia and the majority of published data pertains to it, we will focus on IDA in this review.",0
"8-Prenylnaringenin (8-PN), a potent phytoestrogen, present in hops (Humulus lupulus L.), hop products, and most beers, exhibits an estrogenic activity greater than that of any of the known phytoestrogens. A sensitive, selective, and robust analytical method, based on HPLC-MS (High Performance Liquid Chromatography—Mass Spectrometry) using atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization, has been developed for systematic investigation of the development and the localization of this estrogenic trait in the hop plant, as well as for quantitative determination of 8-PN in hop varieties, hop products, and beers. Excellent linearity was obtained in the range of 3.7–2,200 μg L−1 (γ=0.9999, n=7) and the limit of detection wasca 1 μg L−1. Recoveries were between 93.8% (110 μg L−1) and 96.5% (370 μg L−1) for hop products, and between 63.4% (18.5 μgL−1) and 72.8% (37 μg L−1) for beers. Good precision was achieved with relative standard deviations of less than 5% within-day (n=6) and less than 10% from-day-to-day (n=18).",1
"In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.",1
"Chemical composition and the effects of domestic processing and storage were studied in organically cultivated or wild growing berries, harvested in certificated area in Serbia. The total phenolics content in fresh berries ranged from 380 to 1660 mg GAE/100 g. The phenolic content decreased during the processing to jams, and storage in almost all samples, except in black currant. Among fresh berries, the highest amount of total anthocyanins was found in bilberry (0.61 +/- 0.03 %). Processing and storage caused decrease in anthocyanin content. The most ubiquitous anthocyanin aglycone was found to be cyanidin. Ellagic acid was detected in fresh and frozen black raspberries and related jams, and its content increases during thermal processing to jam. Among fresh berries, bilberry showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity with an IC(50) value of 0.82 mg/ml. However, frozen as well as processed berries in our study still showed comparable high values of radical scavenging activity. After 9 months of storage all investigated jams were microbiologicaly correct. Regardless of the losses in the amount of total phenolics, total anthocyanins and radical scavenging activity, frozen berries and related jams are still excellent sources of nutritional substances with antioxidant potential.",1
"Disposition of citrus flavonoids was evaluated after single oral doses of pure compounds (500 mg naringin and 500 mg hesperidin) and after multiple doses of combined grapefruit juice and orange juice and of once-daily grapefruit. Cumulative urinary recovery indicated low bioavailability ( < 25%) of naringin and hesperidin. The aglycones naringenin and hesperitin were detected in urine and plasma by positive chemical ionization-collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (PCI-CAD MS/MS). After juice administration, PCI-CAD MS/MS detected naringenin, hesperitin, and four related flavanones, tentatively identified as monomethoxy and dimethoxy derivatives. These methoxyflavanones appear to be absorbed from juice. Absorbed citrus flavanones may undergo glucuronidation before urinary excretion.",1
"The effect of cold storage on antioxidant profile and the antioxidant activity of five sweet orange genotypes [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck], three blood (pigmented) varieties with different anthocyanin contents (‘Tarocco Messina’, ‘Tarocco Meli’ and ‘Moro’) and two blond varieties (‘Ovale’ and ‘Valencia late’), stored at 6±1°C for 65d was investigated. During fruit storage, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, vitamin C, flavanones and total phenolics were determined, and juice antioxidant capacity was measured by two different in vitro tests (DPPH scavenging activity and inhibition of induced linoleic acid peroxidation). The results showed an increase in anthocyanins, flavanones and hydroxycinnamic acids and a slight decrease in vitamin C in the blood oranges. Cold storage negatively affected flavanone concentration, while positively influenced vitamin C in blond orange varieties. Both antioxidant activity tests showed an increase in antioxidant capacity during storage caused mainly by phenolic accumulation (blood oranges) and vitamin C increase (blond oranges). Finally, correlations between antioxidant activity and total or individual phenolic components were examined.",1
"The present study was carried out to quantify green tea epicatechin (GTE) derivatives and to investigate the origin of epicatechin epimers present in 18 selected canned or bottled tea drinks. The major GTEs present in tea are (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) and (−)-epicatechin (EC). HPLC analysis showed that the content of total GTEs was lower (16.4–268.3 mg l−1) in the canned and bottled tea drinks than in tea traditionally prepared as a beverage in a cup or teapot (3–5 g l−1). The major finding was that they contained higher levels of epicatechin epimers, namely (−)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), (−)-gallocatechin (GC), catechin gallate (CG) and (−)-catechin (C), than of GTEs, ranging from 7.6 to 331.8 mg l−1. To investigate the origin of these epimers, GTEs were extracted from longjing green tea and autoclaved at various temperatures for 10–60 min. It was found that at least 50% of GTEs were epimerised to their corresponding epimers when autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min. It is concluded that epicatechin epimers in tea drinks are not originally present in green tea leaf but are instead derived from thermal conversion of GTEs. ",1
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with RAM immunophenotype is a newly recognized high-risk AML immunophenotypic subcategory characterized by blasts with bright expression of CD56 and weak to absent expression of CD45, HLA-DR, and CD38, as first described by the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The relationship between AML-RAM and other CD56-positive acute leukemias is unclear. The goal of this study is to characterize the clinicopathological characteristics of AML with RAM phenotype and compare them with other CD56 co-expressing acute leukemias. From a multi-institutional search, we identified a total of 160 CD56+ acute leukemia cases, including AML-RAM ( AML-RAM patients were significantly younger and presented with significantly higher platelet and white blood cell counts and bone marrow (BM) blast percentages when compared to AUL ( We find that AML with RAM phenotype occurs primarily in younger ages, with distinct clinicopathological, immunophenotypic, and mutational presentations, and worse prognosis. This diagnosis should be considered in the clinical differential diagnosis of CD56-positive acute leukemias.",0
"Infant acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a rare and aggressive type of leukaemia, especially when a KMT2A rearrangement is involved. Historical treatment strategies have included intensification of conventional ALL chemotherapy in combination with acute myeloid leukaemia treatment elements. However, outcomes have remained consistently poor compared to the advances that have been seen in childhood ALL. The emergence of novel immunotherapies has transformed treatment strategies, with blinatumomab now incorporated into clinical trials for infants with KMT2A-rearranged ALL, promising significant advancements. Additionally, deeper insights into the unique biology of KMT2A-rearranged ALL have facilitated the development of targeted therapies, such as venetoclax and menin inhibitors, which are under clinical evaluation. These efforts offer renewed hope for better outcomes. This review highlights the substantial progress in understanding and treating KMT2A-rearranged ALL, fuelling optimism for future therapeutic success. In addition, we highlight the challenges that might be faced by using immunotherapy.",0
B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is a malignant disorder of immature B lineage immune progenitors and is the commonest cancer in children. Despite treatment advances it remains a leading cause of death in childhood and response rates in adults remain poor. A preleukemic state predisposing children to BCP-ALL frequently arises,0
"Infectious complications remain the major cause of treatment-related morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study retrospectively compared the patterns of infection in children treated with either the modified St. Jude Total XV protocol (n = 181) or the ALL-IC BFM 2009 protocol (n = 61) at a single center. Although the overall number of infection episodes was similar between the two groups, their distributions across treatment phases differed markedly. The ALL-IC BFM 2009 protocol was associated with a significantly greater incidence of infections during the induction phase, particularly in high-risk patients, who often presented with skin and gastrointestinal tract infections. In contrast, modified St. Jude Total XV protocol presented a greater infection risk during the re-induction phase. Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus epidermidis, were the most frequently isolated pathogens in both cohorts, although the BFM group exhibited a higher proportion of gram-negative infections. The rates of documented viral infections in BFM cohort and modified St. Jude Total XV cohort were 21.4 % vs 9.2 %, respectively. Invasive fungal infection rate was found as 6.7 % in the modified St. Jude group and 4.0 % in the BFM group is in line with the literature. Multivariate analysis confirmed that severe neutropenia and the presence of a central venous catheter were strong independent predictors of infection frequency. These findings underscore protocol-specific differences in infectious risk profiles and emphasize the importance of tailored supportive care strategies in the management of pediatric ALL.",0
"Processed juices from dried prunes with or without pulp, juice from prune concentrate, and the juices of fresh prune and nine other fruits were analyzed for anthocyanins, organic acids, sugars, phenolic compounds, and amino acids. Unique characteristics of processed prune juice were the predominance of alpha-aminobutyric acid, citrulline, taurine, O-phosphoethanolamine, and quinic acid and the absence of anthocyanins, (-)-epicatechin, phloridzin, and citric and tartaric acids. Comprehensive measurements of sugars, anthocyanins, nonvolatile acids, phenolic compounds, and amino acids made it possible to distinguish processed prune juices from fresh prune juice and the juices of plum, cherry, nectarine, peach, apple, pear, grape, kiwi fruit, and strawberry fruits.",1
"Haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis yields a similar overall survival (OS) to HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) HCT with conventional prophylaxis. Given the prognostic implications of donor age, we investigated the impact of donor age (younger [<35 years, n = 868] vs older [≥35 years, n = 418]) and donor type (haploidentical [n = 373] vs MUD [n = 913]) on OS in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Older donor age was independently associated with significantly poor OS, whereas donor type was not. Next, we directly compared the outcomes of a younger haploidentical donor (n = 187) vs an older MUD (n = 232). In this cohort, more patients in the haploidentical group had B-cell immunophenotype (89% vs 77%, respectively, P < .001), poor cytogenetics (61% vs 51%, respectively, P = .44), Philadelphia chromosome-negative (53% vs 48%, respectively, P = .38), received bone marrow graft (42% vs 16%, respectively, P < .001), and reduced-intensity conditioning (45% vs 23%, respectively, P < .001). In the multivariate analysis, the older MUD group was associated with a significantly higher risk of chronic GVHD, higher nonrelapse mortality (NRM), lower relapse, and poorer OS. Despite a higher risk of relapse, younger donor haploidentical HCT with PTCy prophylaxis may be preferred over older MUD HCT with conventional prophylaxis in patients with ALL due to lower NRM and better OS. Further analysis comparing the effect of donor age in haploidentical PTCy vs MUD PTCy is warranted.",0
"The major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of Dalbergia odorifera extract were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and its coupling to mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Utilizing HPLC-MS technique, 18 flavonoids including five isoflavones, four isoflavanones, four neoflavones, two flavanones, two chalcones, one isoflavanonol were identified in free form in serum sample based on comparison with the authentic standards. Furthermore, the amounts of the four prominent flavonoids, (3R)-4'-methoxy-2',3,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, vestitone, formononetin and sativanone were determined in serum by HPLC-UV with internal standard method. The method was validated and utilized in pharmacokinetic studies of these four analytes. This is the first report on identification and determination of the major flavonoids in rat serum after oral administration of D. odorifera extract and the results provided a firm basis for clarifying the pharmacological effect of D. odorifera and evaluating the clinical applications of this medicinal herb.",1
"We report a rare case of adult acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with hypercalcemia and osteolytic bone lesions in a 53-year-old man who died after chemotherapy. The bone marrow examination was evaluated by Wright-Giemsa staining, tissue biopsy, immunohistochemical staining, and flow cytometry. Bone imaging was performed using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) technology. Total calcium levels were measured by biochemical analyzer. The result of PET/CT indicated the patient with B-ALL with severe osteolytic bone lesions. The serum total calcium level was as high as 4.09 mmol/L, and the cytokines interleukin-6 and 17A were significantly elevated. The patient was resistant to chemotherapy and had a poor prognosis. Hypercalcemia and osteolytic bone lesions are rare complications of adult B-ALL, and their co-occurrence may be an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with B-ALL.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer affecting children, making up about 80% of all acute leukemia cases in the pediatric population. While treatment with L-asparaginase (ASNase) has greatly improved survival rates, its bacterial origin often causes immune reactions in some patients, which can reduce how well the therapy works. To overcome this challenge, previous in silico studies designed a humanized chimeric ASNase by swapping out the predicted immunogenic parts of the bacterial enzyme with similar, less immunogenic segments from the human version-while keeping the enzyme's active site intact. In this study, the chimeric L-asparaginase designed was successfully cloned, expressed, and purified using the",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based therapy is of interest for relapsed or refractory (r/r) T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T cell lymphomas. A prominent target antigen for this is the receptor CD7, which is expressed in ∼95% of T-ALL, ∼50% of peripheral T cell lymphomas, as well as 10% of acute myeloid leukemias. Here, we preclinically evaluated and compared CD7-targeted ligand K12-based CAR-T to an scFvCD7-based CAR-T construct. K12 CAR-T cells produced significantly higher interferon gamma (IFN-γ) after CD7 activation compared to scFv-CD7 CAR-T cells. Similarly, in a Jurkat",0
"The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and physicochemical qualities.",1
"Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a valuable alternative donor source for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Various conditioning regimens and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens aimed at improving the outcomes of umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) have been explored; however, the differences in their effects remain unclear. This study was conducted to elucidate the differences in the effects of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimens on UCBT outcomes by disease type in a nationwide, retrospective study. We retrospectively analyzed the effects of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimens on the outcomes of UCBT performed with cyclophosphamide (Cy)/total body irradiation (TBI)-based regimens in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 1126), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 620), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 170), and lymphoma (n = 128). Multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS) demonstrated the benefit of adding high-dose cytarabine to the Cy/TBI regimen for the AML group (relative risk [RR], .76; P = .003) and lymphoma group (RR, .54; P = .02), but not for the ALL and MDS groups. In the ALL group, adding etoposide to the Cy/TBI regimen was associated with a lower OS (RR, 1.45; P = .03). For GVHD prophylaxis, a tacrolimus/methotrexate regimen was associated with a lower OS compared with a cyclosporine/methotrexate regimen in the AML group (RR, 1.26; P = .01); this difference was not observed in the other groups. These differences in OS according to the conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimen were attributable mainly to differences in relapse risk. Our data show that the effects of conditioning regimens and GVHD prophylaxis on UCBT outcomes differed according to disease type. UCBT outcomes could be improved by selecting optimal conditioning regimens and GVHD prophylaxis for each disease type.",0
"The phenolic compounds hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols, and flavan-3-ols of sweet cherry cultivars Burlat, Saco, Summit, and Van harvested in 2001 and 2002 were quantified by HPLC-DAD. Phenolics were analyzed at partially ripe and ripe stages and during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (room temperature) and 1-2 degrees C (cool temperature). Neochlorogenic and p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw). Phenolic acid contents generally decreased with storage at 1-2 degrees C and increased with storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C. Anthocyanin levels increased at both storage temperatures. In cv. Van the anthocyanins increased up to 5-fold during storage at 15 +/- 5 degrees C (from 47 to 230 mg/100 g of fw). Flavonol and flavan-3-ol contents remained quite constant. For all cultivars the levels of phenolic acids were higher in 2001 and the anthocyanin levels were higher in 2002, which suggest a significant influence of climatic conditions on these compounds.",1
"A hallmark of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is the dysregulated expression of oncogenic transcription factors (TFs), including TAL1, NOTCH1 and MYC. Rewiring of the transcriptional program disrupts the tightly controlled spatiotemporal expression of downstream target genes, thereby contributing to leukemogenesis. In this study, we first identify an evolutionarily conserved enhancer element controlling the MYCN oncogene (named enhMYCN) that is aberrantly activated by the TAL1 complex in T-ALL cells. TAL1-positive T-ALL cells are highly dependent on MYCN expression for their maintenance in vitro and in xenograft models. Interestingly, MYCN drives the expression of multiple genes involved in the mevalonate pathway, and T-ALL cells are sensitive to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway. Importantly, MYC and MYCN regulate the same targets and compensate for each other. Thus, MYCN-positive T-ALL cells display a dual dependence on the TAL1-MYCN and NOTCH1-MYC pathways. Together, our results demonstrate that enhMYCN-mediated MYCN expression is required for human T-ALL cells and implicate the TAL1-MYCN-HMGCR axis as a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.",0
"The entity of Philadelphia (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for approximately 20-30% of newly diagnosed adults with B-cell ALL cases in the United States. Compared to other B-cell subtypes, Ph-like ALL is associated with overall poor prognosis and inferior outcomes with high measurable residual disease (MRD) rates following induction therapy, increased risk of treatment failure and relapse as well as short event-free and overall survival. Here we aim to highlight Ph-like ALL genetic subtypes and methods of genomic profiling for diagnosis and disease prognostication, and to summarize current management approaches for frontline treatment including multiagent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, tyrosine kinase and small molecule Inhibitors and the role for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Despite the improvement in the treatment outcomes of adult patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL, patients with Ph-like ALL continue to do poorly with standard therapy. Thus, tailored therapeutic studies are indeed warranted to refine frontline treatment approaches and to improve outcomes for patients with Ph-like ALL.",0
"To analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of children with hypodiploid B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). The clinical data of 1 287 children with BCP-ALL admitted to five hospital in Fujian province from April 2011 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the results of chromosome karyotype, all the patients were grouped into hypodiploid subgroup and non-hypodiploid subgroup. The clinical characteristics, early treatment response ［minimal residual disease (MRD) on middle stage of induction chemotherapy and end of induction chemotherapy］ and long-term efficacy ［overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS)］ were compared. The prognostic factors of hypodiploid BCP-ALL were further explored. Among 1 287 BCP-ALL patients， 28 patients (2.2%) were hypodiploid BCP-ALL. The proportion of patients with white blood cell count （WBC）≥50×10 Children with hypodiploid BCP-ALL have an intermediate prognosis, and MRD ≥0.01% after induction chemotherapy may be a risk factors for poor prognosis. 儿童亚二倍体核型前体B细胞急性淋巴细胞白血病的临床特征及预后分析. 探讨儿童亚二倍体核型前体B细胞急性淋巴细胞白血病（BCP-ALL）的临床特征及预后。. 回顾性分析2011年4月至2020年12月福建省5家医院收治的1 287例初诊BCP-ALL患儿的临床资料。根据染色体核型，将患儿分为伴亚二倍体核型BCP-ALL与不伴亚二倍体核型BCP-ALL组，对比两组患儿的临床特征、早期治疗反应［诱导治疗中及诱导后的微小残留病（MRD）］及远期疗效［总生存率（OS）及无事件生存率（EFS）］，并进一步探讨伴亚二倍体核型BCP-ALL的预后影响因素。. 1 287例B-ALL患儿中，28例（2.2%）为亚二倍体核型。伴亚二倍体核型BCP-ALL组初诊白细胞计数≥50×10 儿童亚二倍体核型BCP-ALL预后中等，诱导治疗后MRD≥0.01%可能为其不良预后的危险因素。.",0
"This study evaluated the prevalence, diameter and location of the mandibular incisive canal (MIC) and the transition pattern and anterior loop length (ALL) of the mental canal and compared these values between A total of 187 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of mandibles, namely, 100 images of dentate mandibles and 87 images of edentulous mandibles, were obtained. CBCT data related to the incisive canal and mental canal were analyzed by one examiner. The prevalence of the MIC was 75∼78 %, showing no difference based on laterality or the presence of teeth. The ALL significantly differed depending on the presence of teeth as well as sex. The presence of teeth affected the size of the MIC in the female group, and the diameter of the MIC in the edentulous group was significantly narrower than that in the dentate group. The diameter of the MIC was significantly greater in males than in females in the edentulous group. Meanwhile, the location of the MIC in the male group depended on the presence of teeth at each measuring point, and the MIC was significantly closer to the lower border of the mandible in the female group than in the male group at all measuring points except at 0 mm. This study indicated that the presence of teeth significantly affects the type of transition of the mental canal, the ALL, and the diameter and location of the MIC. Additionally, sex could be a factor affecting MIC location, MIC diameter and anterior loop length.",0
"A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different plant-derived foods.",1
"Nine commercial brands of grapefruit juice were analyzed for their flavonoid content by HPLC to determine if significant brand-to-brand variance in grapefruit juice flavonoid content exists. Flavonoid glycosides narirutin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, and poncirin have been identified in all the grapefruit juices examined. The aglycone quercetin was detected in only two brands. All the juices were free from methoxylated flavonoid aglycones. There was a significant difference in the amounts of total flavonoids and individual flavonoids in the nine brands. The concentration of total flavonoids ranged between 19.44 and 84.28 mg/100 ml juice. Naringin was found to be the major flavonoid followed by narirutin and hesperidin. Their concentrations ranged from 14.56 to 63.8; 2.25 to 12.20; and 0.24 to 3.12 mg/100 ml juice, respectively.",1
"Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of acquired clonal disorders characterized by dysplastic and ineffective hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. Various specific karyotypic and molecular abnormalities associated with MDS further guide the prognosis. Although translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) (Philadelphia positive [Ph+]) and corresponding BCR-ABL fusion transcript are classically defined to differentiate CML from non-CML myeloproliferative disorders, it is also associated with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), acute myeloid Leukemia (Ph+ AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (Ph+ MDS). The occurrence of Ph+ MDS is very uncommon, and a review of literature has shown by far 40 cases so far in which the majority are seen on progression to Leukemia. Few had de novo presence of such chromosomal abnormality. Due to its rarity, this entity has not yet found its space in the current WHO classification. Also, the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in such a scenario is still debatable. We found two such cases of de novo Ph+ MDS diagnosed at institute of medical sciences, Banaras Hindu university and a brief literature review.",0

Re-assessment at the third presentation identified CSF B-lymphoblasts, and he was subsequently treated for central nervous system relapse of leukaemia. This case highlights an infrequent presenting symptom of ALL relapse and a rare cause of recurrent facial nerve palsy.",0
"Patronage for fitness and wellness activities has increased in Ghana, but the perception of primary consumers regarding exercise delivery service codes of conduct (EDCC) remains undocumented. This study reported the perception of clients about fitness instructors' adherence to EDCC. Three hundred and seventy-nine (mean age = 26.12 ± 8.83 years) clients registered with National Sports for ALL Association, Ghana (NASFAAG) were recruited. The participants were not living with any diagnosed disability, using psychiatric medication, and had consistently participated in fitness training, at least three times a week for a year, and not below the age of 18 years. The participants were recruited from fitness and wellness centers, gyms, and fitness clubs in three regions (Greater Accra-GA, Upper East-UE, and Ashanti-A) of Ghana. A closed-ended, self-structured and validated awareness and adherence exercise delivery codes of conduct questionnaires was administered. The questionnaire focused on data protection and responsibility, informed consent, competence, and professional and personal conduct adapted from the British Association of Sports and Exercise Science codes of conduct was administered. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 was used to run factor analysis which determined factorial distribution of clients' perception of instructors on codes of conduct. In total, 50.99% (UE), 47.68% (A), and 46.02% (GA) clients indicated that identities were unprotected when trainers displayed information. In all, 31.05% (UE), 40.34% (A), and 36.48% (GA) showed they were introduced to substances without consent. In total, 38.89% (UE), 32.70% (A), and 53.55% (GA) clients participated in training to realize that the expertise expected was not provided. In all, 38.10% (UE) and 36.23% (A) agreed that instructors put safety at risk, while 23.02% (GA) exploited clients for personal gain. Fitness instructors need enlightenment to adhere ethically to EDCC activities in Ghana. Activities related to wellness and fitness in Ghana require regulations.",0
"An experimental investigation was carried out on olive oils of the Ogliarola Salentina and Coratina cultivars to assess the influence of the two different olive grinding techniques and kneading process on the quality of the oils. The experimental data obtained showed that resistance to oxidation, total phenols and phenolic compounds analysed for HPLC were higher in the Coratina oils than in the Ogliarola oils. The use of hammer-crushers plus kneader rather than stone mills plus kneader always produced significant increases in the total phenols. Resistance to oxidation was assessed by the Rancimat method and showed a significant correlation with the amounts of total phenols and of an unidentified substance (peak I) which was conspicuously present amongst the substances evaluated for HPLC.",1
"Resveratrol and pterostilbene are two hydroxystilbenic phytoalexins synthesized by Vitaceae. Produced by leaves and grape berries after biotic or abiotic stress, the determination of their concentration can help to evaluate the disease resistance of different vine varieties. Resveratrol is also found in wines, particularly in red wine. These stilbenes are highly sensitive to light and air oxidation. Extraction must be made under nitrogen and protected from light. HPLC separation of resveratrol and pterostilbene is performed on a reversed phase (C18) with a methanol—formic acid (50 mM) gradient. Fluorimetric detection is much more sensitive than UV detection and its specificity allows simple pre-purification of grape berries and direct injection of wines.",1
"Pharmacokinetics of trans-resveratrol in its aglycone (RES(AGL)) and glucuronide (RES(GLU)) forms were studied following intravenous (15 mg/kg i.v.) and oral (50 mg/kg p.o.) administration of trans-resveratrol in a solution of beta-cyclodextrin to intact rats. In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.",1
"In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor venetoclax may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, allowing dose reductions. This phase 1b study of venetoclax plus attenuated chemotherapy enrolled 19 patients with ALL either newly diagnosed (aged ≥60 years, n = 11 [B-cell, n = 8; T-cell, n = 3]) or relapsed/refractory (R/R; aged ≥18 years, n = 8 [B-cell, n = 3; T-cell, n = 5]). Venetoclax was given for 21 days with each cycle of mini-hyper-CVD (mini-HCVD; cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine). There were no dose-limiting toxicities at dose level 1 (DL1; n = 3, 400 mg/d) or DL2 (n = 6, 600 mg/d); DL2 was the recommended phase 2 dose and explored further (n = 10). The most common nonhematologic adverse events were grade ≥3 infections. There were no deaths within 60 days. There was no tumor lysis syndrome, hepatotoxicity, prolonged cytopenias, or early discontinuation for toxicity. Among patients with newly diagnosed ALL, 10 of 11 (90.9%) achieved a measurable residual disease-negative (<0.01% sensitivity) complete remission (CR) including 6 patients with hypodiploid TP53-mutated ALL. All patients in CR bridged to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (n = 9) or completed protocol (n = 1). With a median follow-up of 60 months, median disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with newly diagnosed ALL was 54.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.5 to not available), with a 2-year DFS rate of 90% (95% CI, 71-100). Among patients with R/R ALL, 3 of 8 (37.5%) achieved CR. In summary, for patients with newly diagnosed ALL, venetoclax plus mini-HCVD is well tolerated with promising efficacy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03319901.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), which constitutes of 10-15% of all pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, is known for its complex pathology due to pervasive genetic and chromosomal abnormalities. Although most children are successfully cured, chromosomal rearrangements involving the KMT2A gene is considered a poor prognostic factor. In a cohort of 171 pediatric T-ALL samples, we have studied differences in gene and splice variant patterns in KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) T-ALL compared with KMT2A-negative (KMT2A-wt) T-ALL samples. Our results have identified a distinct gene expression and splice variant expression pattern in pediatric KMT2A-r patient samples including significant expression of splicing regulatory markers ESRP1 and MBNL3. Additionally, the prosurvival long transcript variant of BCL2 were upregulated in KMT2A-r compared with KMT2A-wt T-ALL samples. Lastly, increased levels of activating methylation in the promoter region of CD44 were identified followed by an upregulation of the oncogenic transcript variant CD44v3 in KMT2A-r T-ALL. Together, this suggests that CD44v3 could play a potential role as gene expression-based risk stratification of KMT2A-r T-ALL and could possibly serve as a therapeutic target using splicing modulators.",0
"In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in addition to classical chromosomal abnormalities, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), including copy-neutral LOH, is also observed. While LOH has been described in the literature, its clinical relevance in pediatric ALL remains unclear. The aim of this study is to identify and analyze patterns of LOH, assess their frequency, and evaluate their association with clinical characteristics and early treatment response during the induction phase of the ALL protocol. The study included 853 pediatric ALL patients, of whom 120 had B-ALL LOH+ and 58 had T-ALL LOH+. LOH was analyzed using CytoScan HD SNP microarrays. Patients were stratified using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC), which identified three genetically and clinically distinct clusters. In B-ALL, two clusters with extensive LOH-particularly involving chromosome 9-were associated with poor prognosis and suboptimal response to therapy. In contrast, Cluster 2, characterized by CDKN2A duplication and rare LOH, showed a favorable clinical course. In T-ALL, Cluster 1 had LOH in CDKN2A but favorable outcomes; Cluster 2 exhibited biallelic CDKN2A deletion and aggressive disease; Cluster 3 lacked CDKN2A alterations and showed a genetically stable profile. LOH was common on chromosomes not typically affected by trisomy and rare on those gained. Our study indicates that LOH profiling can positively influence patient stratification by identifying high-risk subgroups, inform prognosis by highlighting unfavorable genetic alterations, and help predict poor treatment response in specific clinical profiles.",0
"CD19 CAR T-cell therapy is a significant advance in B-NHL and ALL. This study describes the incidence, onset, and factors of dermatologic adverse events (dAE) post-therapy. A retrospective analysis at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (4/2013-8/2020) identified 193 patients undergoing CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. We aimed to characterize dAEs post CAR T-cell therapy including the 100-day cumulative incidence, time to dAE onset, and associations with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Eighty-two patients experienced 94 dAEs within the first 100 days (incidence: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.36-0.51) post CAR T-cell therapy. Common dAEs were rash (30.9%, n = 29) including maculopapular rash, inflammatory papules, and local erythema; infection (23.4%, n = 22) including cellulitis and folliculitis; and xerosis (16.0%, n = 15). Specific early onset dAEs included rash and chemotherapy-related events, eg, alopecia, mucositis (median 12- and 17-days postinfusion, respectively). Thrombocytopenic purpura and xerosis presented later (median 22-and 25-days). CRS and dAEs occurred in 33.5% of patients, with CRS preceding dAEs in 86% of cases. Among 15% with ICANS and dAEs, ICANS was antecedent in 67%. dAEs following CAR T-cell therapy are common but mostly low-grade and often manifest within the initial month postinfusion.",0
"Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in health-promoting physiological functions.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is known for its tendency to present with extramedullary infiltrates, commonly affecting lymph nodes, the spleen, the central nervous system, the orbit, skin, and testes. Less commonly, leukemia can infiltrate unusual sites such as the cervix, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and thyroid gland. However, it is exceedingly rare for leukemia to present with ascites as the initial symptom. By reporting this rare case, the study seeks to contribute to a better understanding of ALL's varied presentations and improve early detection and management strategies, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A 30-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with the primary complaint of ascites. ALL. The patient was initially diagnosed with suppurative peritonitis through abdominal puncture. The abdominal computed tomography scan revealed ileocecal lesions, which were thought to be the source of the purulent peritonitis. Despite receiving antibacterial therapy and undergoing peritoneal effusion drainage, the treatment proved ineffective. The patient chose to discontinue hospitalization and was discharged on June 22. On August 24, he was readmitted to Nanjing First Hospital. A follow-up abdominal computed tomography scan revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen, raising suspicion of a hematological malignancy. Bone marrow cytology subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of ALL. The patient was admitted to the hematology department for further treatment. Unfortunately, despite intervention, the patient passed away. Although it is rare for ALL to present initially with ascites, clinicians should consider leukemia as a potential diagnosis in patients presenting with ascites, particularly when conventional treatments for other diagnoses are ineffective.",0
"Vincristine sulfate (VIN) is commonly employed as a cytotoxic agent in the treatment of hematological malignancies, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, its maximum therapeutic benefits have been hindered due to the dose-dependent neurotoxic effects it can induce, which traditionally manifest as autonomic and peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy. The innovative approach aimed to address VIN's neurotoxic limitations while preserving its therapeutic efficacy in combating hematological malignancies, including ALL. The liposomes were prepared using the reverse-phase evaporation method. This method involved the encapsulation of VIN within liposomes through a controlled evaporation process. Secondly, PEGylated liposomes were synthesized through PEGylation. The liposomes were examined using scanning electron spectroscopy, revealing a smooth and spherical surface morphology. The particle size of the liposomes ranged from 90±0.5 to 120±0.4 nm. The encapsulation efficiency of the liposomes was found to be 77.24% and the highest drug release reached 95% over 50 hours. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that the liposomal formulation exhibited a non-toxic nature. Furthermore, in an in-vivo cellular uptake study, the PEGylated liposomes showed efficient accumulation within tumor cells. The liposomal formulation demonstrated superior effectiveness in treating ALL compared to the pure form of the drug.",0
"Lignan (sesamol, sesamin, and sesamolin) profile was determined in different cultivars (botanically identified or market samples) of sesame seeds and commercial oils procured from different parts of India. The wide variation observed in total lignans from 21 sesame seed and 9 commercial oils was attributed to variations in sesamin and sesamolin contents. Lignan content was high (18 g sesamin/kg, 10 g sesamolin/kg) in seasame cultivars obtained from the northeastern states of India. In two of the commercial oils having the Agmark label, the total lignan content was ∼12 g/kg (7.3 g sesamin, 4.7 g sesamolin), 50% of the maximum permissible levels of unsaponifiable matter. In both the seeds and commercial oils, γ-tocopherol was the only representative of tocopherol isomers identified. Sesamin and sesamolin were isolated and crystallized from high-lignan cultivars, and their purity was confirmed by HPLC and spectral (UV and fluorescence) analysis.",1
"Chemical composition, colour differences of black tea infusions and their relationships with sensory quality assessed by tea tasters were analysed. There were significant correlations between the individual quality attributes. Content of caffeine, nitrogen, amino acids, polyphenols, gallocatechin (GC), epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin (C), epicatechin (EC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), catechin gallate (CG), total catechins, theaflavin (TF) and theaflavin-3′-gallate (TF3′G) and infusion colour indicators of ΔL, Δa, Δb and ΔE were significantly correlated to total quality score (TQS). The parameters correlating significantly with the TQS were classified into four groups. Group 1 was compounds containing nitrogen, group 2 phenol compounds, group 3 tea pigments and group 4 infusion colour indicators. Four principal components were screened from the four groups as independent variables for constructing regression equations for estimation of black tea quality by principal component analysis. The regression of the TQS upon the principal components gives a highly significant relationship.",1
"trans-Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4′.trihydroxystilbene), piceid (resveratrol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers and quercetin were measured in red wines from cultivars grown in Portuguese mainland and Azores Islands. Crude hydroxystilbenes and quercetin were extracted by solid-phase extraction-C18 cartridges, and eluted with ethyl acetate. Recoveries of added trans-resveratrol and quercetin were between 90.2 to 101% (mean 96.8%) and between 95.2 and 97.6% (mean 96.2%), respectively. The precision measured by coefficients of variation (overall mean) ranged from 1.8 to 3.3%, and the calibration curves were linear with the mean correlation coefficients of 0.9997 and 0.9978 for trans-resveratrol and quercetin, respectively. The wine polyphenolic compounds were separated by reverse-phase C18 HPLC column and identified by UV fast scanning, retention times and HPLC/MS. The average content of total stilbenes was 4.75 and 6.33 mg/l, that of quercetin was 4.38 and 5.57 mg/l, and the trans/cis ratio was 8.32 and 10.89 for piceid and 5.2 and 4.09 for resveratrol in Portuguese mainland and Azorean wines, respectively. The Azorean wine (Basalto) was notable in having the highest trans-resveratrol concentration. The aroma profile of red wine samples from different regions were compared using SPME/GC-MS headspace methodology.",1
"Sarcopenia is a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder. Early diagnosis is necessary to reduce the adverse effects and consequences of sarcopenia, which can help prevent and manage it in a timely manner. The aim of this study was to identify the important risk factors for sarcopenia diagnosis and compare the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the early detection of potential sarcopenia. A cross-sectional design was employed for this study, involving 160 participants aged 65 years and over who resided in a community. ML algorithms were applied by selecting 11 features-sex, age, BMI, presence of hypertension, presence of diabetes mellitus, SARC-F score, MNA score, calf circumference (CC), gait speed, handgrip strength (HS), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)-from a pool of 107 clinical variables. The results of the three best-performing algorithms were presented. The highest accuracy values were achieved by the ALL (male + female) model using LightGBM (0.931), random forest (RF; 0.927), and XGBoost (0.922) algorithms. In the female model, the support vector machine (SVM; 0.939), RF (0.923), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN; 0.917) algorithms performed the best. Regarding variable importance in the ALL model, the last HS, sex, BMI, and MUAC variables had the highest values. In the female model, these variables were HS, age, MUAC, and BMI, respectively. Machine learning algorithms have the ability to extract valuable insights from data structures, enabling accurate predictions for the early detection of sarcopenia. These predictions can assist clinicians in the context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM).",0

"Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is a heterogenous group of acute leukemias characterized by leukemic blasts that express markers of multiple lineages. The revised 4th edition WHO classification of MPAL excludes AML with myelodysplasia related changes (AML-MRC), including those with complex karyotype (CK), from a diagnosis of MPAL. Abnormal karyotype is frequent in MPAL with the reported rate of CK in MPAL ranging from 19% to 32%. Due its rarity, the clinical and genetic features of MPAL with CK remain poorly characterized. This study aims to further characterize the genetic features of MPAL with CK in comparison to cases of AML and ALL with CK. Cases of de novo MPAL, AML, and B- and T-ALL patients with CK were collected from 8 member institutions of the Bone Marrow Pathology Group. We found no significant difference in overall survival between MPAL with CK compared to AML and ALL with CK. AML with CK was more strongly associated with TP53 mutations, however the presence of TP53 mutations conferred a worse prognosis regardless of lineage. ALL with CK seems to show increased IKZF1 mutation rates which is known to confer a worse prognosis in ALL. Additionally, MPAL with CK showed similarly poor outcomes regardless of whether a lymphoid or myeloid chemotherapy regimen is chosen. Our results suggest that acute leukemias with complex karyotype show a similarly poor outcome regardless of lineage differentiation and that mutation in TP53 confers a poor prognosis in all lineages. Our results support the exclusion of immunophenotypic MPAL with CK from MPAL and appear to confirm the approach proposed in the revised 4th edition WHO to include them as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes and similar myelodysplasia-related AML categories of newer classifications.",0
"A novel gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was developed, using an ion trap mass spectrometer, for the simultaneous determination of olive oil bioactive components, elenolic acid, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol, in rat urine. Samples were analyzed by GC-MS/MS prior to and after enzymatic treatment. A solid phase extraction sample pretreatment step with greater than 80% analytical recoveries for all compounds was performed followed by a derivatization reaction prior to GC-MS/MS analysis. The calibration curves were linear for all compounds studied for a dynamic range between 1 and 500 ng. The limit of detection was in the mid picogram level for tyrosol and elenolic acid (300 pg) and in the low picogram level for hydroxytyrosol (2.5 pg). The method was applied to the analysis of rat urine samples after sustained oral intake of oleuropein or extra virgin olive oil as a diet supplement.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a significant concern in both pediatric and adult demographics. Despite 156 approved cancer therapies based on small molecules, a mere five apply to all types of leukemia. Unfortunately, adherence to these treatments is low due to adverse side effects. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify more effective treatment options for ALL. This study presents a potential solution. We have designed over fifty analogs of carbamazepine, utilizing a combination of ligand-based and structure-based drug design methodologies. Among these analogs, we identified the CR80 analog, which demonstrated predicted binding values of -8.66 kcal/mol against beta-tubulin, a favorable LogP, and IC50 values suitable for in vitro evaluation. The CR80 compound was synthesized with a yield of 50% and subsequently assessed in vitro against the U-937 cell line. It obtained an IC50 value of 0.8 micromolar to 1 micromolar and a selectivity index of two, thus marking it as a promising candidate for in vivo studies.",0
"Isopropyl 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropanoate (IDHP), a metabolite of Danshensu, from Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been proved to have potential as a novel drug for regulation of vasomotor activity in small-resistance vascular circulation. In this presentation we report a new specific method for analysis of IDHP in rabbit plasma. Plasma samples were pretreated with 1.5% formic acid in acetonitrile to remove the protein, and the resulting supernatant was extracted with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a C₁₈ column with 15.0% acetonitrile in 0.3% aqueous formic acid (pH 2.2) as mobile phase. Multiple-reaction-mode ion-trap mass spectrometry was selected for accurate analysis of IDHP. The calibration plot was linear in the range 0.1-200.0 ng mL⁻¹ for plasma samples. The detection limit was 0.02 ng mL⁻¹. Intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were <13.0% and intra-day and inter-day accuracy was within ±8.0% of known concentrations. Finally, the method was used to investigate the pharmacokinetics of IDHP in rabbits; the results indicated IDHP was eliminated rapidly after oral administration.",1
"We aimed to describe incidence and all-cause mortality of hematological pediatric malignancies (leukemia and lymphomas) in Kazakhstan based on nationwide large-scale healthcare data from the Unified National Electronic Healthcare System (UNEHS) for the 2014-2021 year period. The cohort included data of patients less than 18 years old with the diagnosis of hematological malignancies registered in the UNEHS (inpatient and outpatient registries) for the year period 2014-2021. Descriptive statistics were conducted to indicate socio-demographic characteristics of the cohort. Incidence and all-cause mortality were calculated per 100,000 population. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between determinants with the all-cause mortality. The total cohort consisted of 3357 children with leukemia and 1474 children with lymphomas. The mean age at diagnosis of leukemia and lymphomas was 7.3 ± 4.7 and 9.9 ± 4.9 years, respectively. The incidence rate of hematological malignancies was 6.8 per 100,000 in 2021. Patients with ALL had a higher incidence rate than patients with AML (3.4 and 1.2 per 100,000 in 2021, respectively). The incidence rate of HL and NHL was relatively similar which varied from 0.6 to 2.6 per 100,000 in 2014-2021. All-cause mortality of pediatric hematological malignancies varied from 1.1 to 1.5 per 100,000 in 2014-2021, with the peak in 2016 (1.7 per 100,000). Younger age is significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality in children with AML. Patients with ALL had a higher incidence rate than patients with AML. The incidence rate of HL and NHL was relatively similar. All-cause mortality rates for leukemia and lymphomas were quite stable during the study period. Younger age is significantly associated with increased all-cause mortality among AML patients. However, there is no significant association of age with all-cause mortality among ALL, HL and NHL. In order to obtain more reliable data and analysis on pediatric (hematological) malignancies, specific registries for childhood tumors (including detailed information on relapses, treatments, short and long-term side effects, and specific death causes) should be implemented. • Leukemias and lymphomas together account for around 45% of all pediatric malignancies. • Lymphoma accounts for 12% of all childhood malignancies; non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are more frequent than Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL). • The incidence rate of ALL was higher than the incidence rate of AML throughout the whole study period, whereas all-cause mortality of ALL and AML was quite stable. • According to Cox PH analysis, younger age (0-5 years old) was associated with a higher risk of death among AML children compared to older children, and no significant association of age was observed with all-cause mortality among ALL and lymphomas.",0
Sorghum procyanidins were characterized and quantified from two brown sorghum varieties and their processed products by normal phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The DP of the procyanidins was determined by thiolysis. Quantification was done by using purified oligomeric and polymeric cocoa procyanidins as external standards. Sorghum procyanidins were composed mostly of high MW (DP > 10) polymers. Significant differences were observed in levels as well as distribution of the different MW procyanidins between the sorghums. Processing of the sorghum brans into cookies and bread significantly reduced the levels of procyanidins; this effect was more pronounced in the higher MW polymers. Cookies had a higher retention of procyanidins (42-84%) than bread (13-69%). Extrusion of sorghum grain resulted in an increase in the levels of procyanidin oligomers with DP </= 4 and decrease in polymers with DP >/= 6. This suggests a possible breakdown of the high MW polymers to the lower MW constituents during extrusion. Processing changes not only the content of procyanidins in sorghum products but also the relative ratio of the different molecular weights.,1
"The E26-transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factors regulate multiple aspects of the normal hematopoietic system. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting aberrant ETS activity and its contribution to leukemia initiation and progression. In this study, we evaluated the small-molecule ETS inhibitor TK216 and demonstrated its anti-tumor activity in pediatric leukemia. We found TK216 induced growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and inhibited the migratory capability of leukemic cells, without significantly inhibiting the cell viability of normal blood mononuclear cells. Priming the leukemic cells with 5-Azacitidine enhanced the cytotoxic effects of TK216 on pediatric leukemia cells. Importantly, we found purine-rich box1 (PU.1) to be a potential target of TK216 in myeloid and B-lymphoid leukemic cells. In addition, TK216 sharply decreased Mcl-1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this, TK216 also potentiated the cytotoxic effects of Bcl-2 inhibition in venetoclax-resistant cells. The sustained survival benefit provided to leukemic cells in the presence of bone-marrow-derived conditioned media is also found to be modulated by TK216. Taken together, our data indicates that TK216 could be a promising targeted therapeutic agent for the treatment of acute myeloid and B-lymphoid leukemia.",0
"Acute leukemia (AL) is the most common malignancy in children in Mexico and Latin America, where high incidence and mortality rates are observed, particularly among populations with indigenous ancestry and unfavorable socioeconomic conditions. This article examines the social and biological determinants that influence the onset and progression of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), highlighting the Greaves and Kinlen hypotheses and their potential relevance in Latin American contexts. Evidence suggests that factors such as poverty, educational disadvantage, overcrowding, and limited access to healthcare directly affect childhood mortality from AL. In the analysis conducted specifically for this study, using publicly available open-access databases, a poverty-mortality gradient was identified, showing that the poorest municipalities face a higher risk of leukemia-related death in individuals under 20 years of age. The study concludes that epidemiology, when integrated with principles of social justice, is essential for designing and monitoring public policy interventions aimed at reducing inequalities and improving childhood survival in Mexico. La leucemia aguda (LA) representa la principal neoplasia en niños en México y América Latina, donde se observan tasas de incidencia y mortalidad elevadas, particularmente en poblaciones con ascendencia indígena y condiciones socioeconómicas desfavorables. Este artículo analiza los determinantes sociales y biológicos que influyen en la aparición y evolución de la leucemia linfoblástica aguda (LLA), y destaca las hipótesis de Greaves y Kinlen, así como su posible adecuación en contextos latinoamericanos. La evidencia sugiere que factores como la pobreza, el rezago educativo, el hacinamiento y el acceso limitado a servicios de salud impactan directamente en la mortalidad infantil por LA. En el análisis realizado específicamente para este trabajo, con la utilización de bases de datos públicas y de acceso abierto, se identificó un gradiente pobreza-mortalidad, en el que los municipios más pobres presentan un mayor riesgo de muerte por leucemia en menores de 20 años de edad. Se concluye que la epidemiología, al integrarse con principios de justicia social, es clave para diseñar y dar seguimiento a intervenciones de poliítica pública que se implementen para reducir las desigualdades y mejoren la supervivencia infantil en México.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-based therapeutic regimens have markedly improved the survival of children with ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). However, survivors are at risk of secondary neoplasms. Few studies on such secondary neoplasms have been conducted outside of Europe and the United States. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcomes of secondary neoplasms in long-term survivors of ALL and LBL at a tertiary pediatric oncology center in Mie prefecture, Japan. We retrospectively reviewed 188 patients with ALL and LBL who were treated with an ALL-based therapeutic regimen at Mie University Hospital from January 1, 1977 to December 31, 2022 and followed up. Ten patients developed secondary neoplasms, with 10-year and 20-year cumulative incidences of 2.9% [standard error (SE) = 1.5%] and 5.5% (SE = 2.3%), respectively. The median interval between the primary-cancer diagnosis and secondary-neoplasm diagnosis was 18.5 years (range: 7.8-41.7 years). All 10 secondary neoplasms were central nervous system (CNS) tumors (6 meningiomas and 4 high-grade gliomas). Radiotherapy ( As secondary gliomas occurred earlier than meningiomas and are associated with poor outcomes, physicians should take great pains to minimize their risk to improve long-term survival and quality of life.",0
"Phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of extra-virgin olive oils extracted from several Italian varieties were studied at production and during storage. The antioxidant activity was measured according to the following tests: in the aqueous phase, by radical scavenging of the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cation; and in the lipid phase, using the beta-carotene bleaching method. The phenolic content was not correlated to the oxidation indices (peroxide value and spectrophotometric constants). The phenolic contents and profiles of the various cultivars showed remarkable differences. The phenolic content was strongly correlated with the antioxidant activity measured according to the beta-carotene test and weakly correlated with the radical scavenging ability.",1
"A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify free and total phenolic acids (m-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ellagic acid) in plant foods. Free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and 10% acetic acid. Bound phenolic acids were liberated using first alkaline and then acid hydrolysis followed by extraction with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate (1:1). All fractions were quantified separately by HPLC. After HPLC quantification, results of alkali and acid hydrolysates were calculated to represent total phenolic acids. Ellagic acid was quantified separately after long (20 h) acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the determination of phenolic acids in plant foods. DAD response was linear for all phenolic acids within the ranges evaluated, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.999. Coefficients of variation for 4-8 sample replicates were consistently below 10%. Recovery tests of phenolic acids were performed for every hydrolysis condition using several samples. Recoveries were generally good (mean >90%) with the exceptions of gallic acid and, in some cases, caffeic acid samples.",1
"Injuries are the leading cause of death among children and youth in the United States, representing a major concern to society and to the public and private health plans covering pediatric patients. Data from ALL Kids, Alabama's Children's Health Insurance Program, were used to evaluate the relationship between community-level social determinants of health (SDOH) and pediatric emergency department (ED) use and differences in these associations by age and race. This was a retrospective, pooled cross-sectional analysis. We used ALL Kids data to identify ED visits (injury and all-cause) among children who were enrolled at any time from 2015 to 2017. Exploratory factor analysis was used to categorize SDOH from 18 selected Census tract-level variables. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the effects of community and individual factors and their interactions. Census tract-level SDOH were grouped as low socioeconomic status (SES), urbanicity, and immigrant-density factors. Low SES and urbanicity factors were associated with ED visits (injury and all-cause). The low SES and urbanicity factors also moderated the association between race and ED visits (injury and all-cause). The environment in which children live influences their ED use; however, the impact varies by age, race, and Census tract factors. Further studies should focus on specific community factors to better understand the relationship among SDOH, individual characteristics, and ED utilization.",0
"The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.",1
"Gene expression profiling is the criterion standard for recognizing Ph-like ALL signatures among B-ALLs. The prerequisite of GEP is the accurate normalization of target genes with stable expression of housekeeping genes in a quantitative PCR. HKGs exhibit differential expression in the different experimental conditions and affect the target genes' expression, leading to imprecise qPCR results. The selection of stable HKGs is crucial in GEP experiments, especially in identifying high-risk Ph-like ALL cases. We have evaluated the expression stability of nine HKGs (GAPDH, ACTB, GUSB, RNA18S, EEF2, PGK1, B2M, TBP and ABL1) in identified Ph-like ALLs and Ph-negative (n = 23 each) using six algorithms, 4 traditional softwares; geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, Delta Cq value method, and two algorithms, RefFinderTM and ComprFinder. Further, we have validated the expression of 8 overexpressed normalized genes in Ph-like ALL cases (JCHAIN, CA6, MUC4, SPATS2L, BMPR1B, CRLF2, ADGRF1 and NRXN3). GeNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder, Delta Cq value method, RefFinderTM and ComprFinder algorithm analysis revealed that EEF2, GAPDH, and PGK1 form the best representative HKGs in Ph-like ALL cases, while RNA18s, ß-actin, and ABL1 in Ph-negative ALLs. Lastly, we performed a correlation analysis and found that the combination of EEF2, GAPDH, and PGK1 represents the best combination with a very high correlation in Ph-like ALL cases. This is the first report that shows EEF2, GAPDH, and PGK1 are the best HKG genes and can be used in the diagnostic panel of Ph-like ALL cases using qPCR at baseline diagnosis.",0
"During the 2-year maintenance treatment phase (MT) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), personalized patient-specified titration of oral antimetabolite drug doses is required to ensure maximum tolerated systemic drug exposure. Drug titration is difficult to implement in practice and insufficient systemic drug exposure resulting from inadequate dose titration increases risk of ALL relapse. We developed an open-source R-based analytical toolkit, including the allMT R package and an interactive web-based R Shiny VIATAMIN application, to evaluate antimetabolite drug titration during MT. Evaluation is initiated with basic visualization analysis of drug titration, in both individual patients and patient cohorts. Observations are supplemented with descriptive analyses of hematological toxicity frequency and prescriber compliance rates with protocol drug titration rules. In individual patients, visual and quantitative analyses indicate recurring potentially correctable suboptimal drug titration patterns. In patient cohorts, the toolkit enables evaluation of the impact of interventions to optimize MT drug titration. Incorporation of the toolkit in a forthcoming clinical decision support system for MT would enable real-time examination and course correction of drug titration practice. Future versions will be enhanced to include other variables that influence drug titration practice, including clinical toxicity data and later, pharmacological markers of antimetabolite, adherence, and drug activity.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based cell therapies have transformed the treatment of haematological malignancies, especially acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, drug resistance limits long-term efficacy. This study aimed to develop a novel combination therapy using aptamer‒drug conjugates and CAR19-T/natural killer (NK) cells to eliminate tumour cells completely and improve the efficacy of CAR-based cell therapies. A novel circular aptamer‒drug conjugate (C-ApDC) targeting protein tyrosine kinase-7 (PTK7) was designed and synthesized, and CD19 CAR-T and CAR-NK cells were constructed. The stability of C-ApDC was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis, its binding specificity was evaluated by flow cytometry, and its cytotoxicity was measured by a CCK-8 assay. The synergistic effect between C-ApDC and CAR19-T/NK cells was comprehensively assessed through flow cytometry cytotoxicity analysis. To further validate the feasibility of combination therapy, we synthesized a novel C-ApDC-nanobody conjugate and combined it with CAR19-NK/T cells. The stability of the conjugate was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the cytotoxic effects of the combination regimen on tumour cells were detected by flow cytometry. C-ApDC exhibited greater stability than linear ApDC and specifically bound to and killed PTK7-expressing Nalm6 cells in vitro. C-ApDC significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAR19-T/NK cells to tumour cells. Similarly, the C-ApDC-nanobody conjugate, when used in combination with CAR19-NK/T cells, exhibited high stability. A combination therapy composed of C-ApDC nanobodies and CAR19-T/NK cells was successfully developed. This innovative approach effectively enhances the cytotoxicity of CAR19-T/NK cells against tumour cells, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for tumour treatment and offering a promising solution to overcome CAR-T resistance.",0
"IntroductionPegaspargase (PEG) is a key component of standard regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL) and extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL). Emerging evidence suggests an opportunity to decrease incidence of PEG-associated toxicities with dose capping, but evidence is limited. This study aims to evaluate whether a significant difference in PEG-associated toxicities related to dosing strategy exists and to identify patient-specific or regimen-specific factors for PEG-related toxicity.MethodsA retrospective analysis of PEG-associated toxicities was completed in adult patients with ALL or NKTCL who received PEG within Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 10403 or modified dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, etoposide (mSMILE) regimens at the UW Medical Center/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. PEG-associated toxicities that occurred through 8 weeks after PEG doses were noted.ResultsTwenty-eight patients received dose-capped PEG, and 29 received noncapped PEG. Fewer all-grade and grade 3/4 toxicities were observed in the dose-capped cohort. Grade 3/4 toxicities observed were hepatotoxicity, hyperglycemia, hypersensitivity, and hypertriglyceridemia. In addition, fewer grade 3/4 pancreatitis and thrombosis events occurred in the dose-capped cohort. Hypertriglyceridemia and hepatotoxicity were associated with the highest cumulative incidence proportions among all toxicities.ConclusionDose capping of PEG was associated with a similar or later median onset for most toxicities, a less heterogeneic toxicity profile, and a lower recurrence of most toxicities upon PEG rechallenge compared to the non-dose-capped cohort. Standardizing PEG dose capping in the CALGB 10403 and mSMILE regimens may translate to improved tolerance compared to a historical standard of no dose capping PEG.",0
"We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.",1
"Metformin, a medication for type 2 diabetes, has been linked to many non-diabetes health benefits including increasing healthy lifespan. Previous work has only examined the benefits of metformin over periods of less than ten years, which may not be long enough to capture the true effect of this medication on longevity. We searched medical records for Wales, UK, using the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage dataset for type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin (N = 129,140) and sulphonylurea (N = 68,563). Non-diabetic controls were matched on sex, age, smoking, and history of cancer and cardiovascular disease. Survival analysis was performed to examine survival time after first treatment, using a range of simulated study periods. Using the full twenty-year period, we found that type 2 diabetes patients treated with metformin had shorter survival time than matched controls, as did sulphonylurea patients. Metformin patients had better survival than sulphonylurea patients, controlling for age. Within the first three years, metformin therapy showed a benefit over matched controls, but this reversed after five years of treatment. While metformin does appear to confer benefits to longevity in the short term, these initial benefits are outweighed by the effects of type 2 diabetes when patients are observed over a period of up to twenty years. Longer study periods are therefore recommended for studying longevity and healthy lifespan. Work examining the non-diabetes outcomes of metformin therapy has suggested that there metformin has a beneficial effect on longevity and healthy lifespan. Both clinical trials and observational studies broadly support this hypothesis, but tend to be limited in the length of time over which they can study patients or participants. By using medical records we are able to study individuals with Type 2 diabetes over a period of two decades. We are also able to account for the effects of cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, deprivation, and smoking on longevity and survival time following treatment. We confirm that there is an initial benefit to longevity of metformin therapy, but this benefit does not outweigh the negative effect on longevity of diabetes. Therefore, we suggest that longer study periods are required for inference to be made about longevity in future research.",0
"WDR54 has been recently identified as a novel oncogene in colorectal and bladder cancers. However, the expression and function of WDR54 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) were not reported. In this study, we investigated the expression of WDR54 in T-ALL, as well as its function in T-ALL pathogenesis using cell lines and T-ALL xenograft. Bioinformatics analysis indicated high mRNA expression of WDR54 in T-ALL. We further confirmed that the expression of WDR54 was significantly elevated in T-ALL. Depletion of WDR54 dramatically inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at S phase in T-ALL cells in vitro. Moreover, knockdown of WDR54 impeded the process of leukemogenesis in a Jurkat xenograft model in vivo. Mechanistically, the expression of PDPK1, phospho-AKT (p-AKT), total AKT, phospho-ERK (p-ERK), Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were downregulated, while cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were upregulated in T-ALL cells with WDR54 knockdown. Additionally, RNA-seq analysis indicated that WDR54 might regulate the expression of some oncogenic genes involved in multiple signaling pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest that WDR54 may be involved in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of T-ALL.",0
"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative option for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have achieved remission. This systematic review and meta-analysis compare the efficacy of total body irradiation (TBI) versus chemotherapy (CHT) based regimens for conditioning in adult ALL patients being prepared for HSCT. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and relevant trial registries from their inception to August 2024. The inclusion criteria encompassed all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that compared TBI with CHT as conditioning regimens prior to HSCT in adult patients with ALL. The primary outcomes assessed were overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS). All statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan version 5.4, using a random-effects model. This meta-analysis includes 20 cohort studies and one RCT. The relative risk (RR) for OS was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.20-1.57), while the RR for EFS was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.15-1.43), highlighting the superior efficacy of TBI-based regimens in this patient population. TBI was also superior in terms of relapse rate (RR 0.71). The 2 regimens were comparable in terms of nonrelapse mortality, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and chronic GVHD. When used for conditioning prior to HSCT, TBI-based conditioning regimens demonstrate superior OS, EFS, and relapse outcomes compared to CHT-based regimens.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has distinct biological characteristics and a poorer prognosis than B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This trial aimed to reduce the rate of radiation and haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) while improving outcomes by adding nelarabine, intensified L-asparaginase, and protracted intrathecal therapy in the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM)-type treatment. In this nationwide, multicenter, phase 2 trial, we enrolled patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (age <25 years at diagnosis) conducted by Japan Children's Cancer Group and Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group. Patients were stratified into standard-risk, high-risk, and very-high-risk groups according to prednisolone response, CNS status, and end-of-consolidation minimal residual disease. We used the Associazione Italiana di Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-BFM-ALL 2000-backbone chemotherapy. Nelarabine (650 mg/m Between Dec 1, 2011, and Nov 30, 2017, of 349 eligible patients (median age 9 years [IQR 6-13]), 238 (68%) were male, and 28 (8%) patients had CNS3 status. 168 (48%) patients were stratified as standard risk, 103 (30%) as high risk, 39 (11%) as very high risk, and 39 (11%) as no risk (patients who had off protocol treatment before risk assessment. The composite complete remission (complete remission plus complete remission in suppression) rate after remission induction therapy was 89% (298 of 335 patients). HSCT was performed in 35 (10%) of 333 patients. With a median follow-up of 5·2 years (IQR 3·6-6·7), 3-year event-free survival was 86·4% (95% CI 82·3-89·7%) and 3-year overall survival was 91·3% (87·7-93·8%). The proportion of minimal residual disease disappearance was 0·86 (12 of 14 patients; 95% CI 0·57-0·98) in group A and 0·50 (6 of 12 patients, 0·21-0·79) in group B. Grade 3 peripheral motor neuropathy was seen in 11 (3%) of 349 patients and sensory neuropathy was seen in 6 (2%) patients. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse event was febrile neutropenia (294 [84%] of 349 patients).

"The occurrence of two dihydrochalcone glycosides has been demonstrated in Golden Delicious apple juices and jams by HPLC analysis. These substances have been isolated by a combination of Amberlite XAD-2 and reversed-phase liquid chromatography and by semipreparative HPLC. They have been completely identified as 2′,4′,6′,4-tetrahydroxydihydrochalcone-2′-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (phloridzin) and 2′,4′,6′,4-tetrahydroxy-dihydrochalcone-2′-O-(6″-β-d-xylopyranosyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside by spectroscopic methods.",1
"Acute leukemia is an aggressive, highly heterogeneous hematological malignancy. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase Domain-6 (ADAM6), a member of ADAMs family, has emerged recently as a potential novel player in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and its function remains largely elusive. Serine Protease-1 (PRSS1) is another emerging molecular mediator in cancer development. However, its role in acute leukemia has not been adequately studied. Interestingly, ADAM6 and PRSS1 were identified among the genes with the highest percentage of chromosomal changes in profiled B-cell precursor ALL patients. Both are emerging novel mediators of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the roles of ADAM6 and PRSS1 in ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults. Adult patients with de novo ALL (n = 36), de novo AML (n = 40), and healthy control subjects (n = 55) were enrolled in this study. Circulating serum levels of ADAM6 and PRSS1 were measured by ELISA technique. Serum levels of ADAM6 were significantly higher in ALL and AML patients compared to healthy control subjects (208.7(178.3-337.3), 186.4(155.3-479.6), and 78.6(55.8-101.8) pg/ml, p < 0.0001), respectively. Whereas, serum levels of PRSS1 were found to be significantly lower in ALL and AML patients compared to healthy controls (175.1(153.7-232.2), 177.9(145.3-206.4), and 247.5(204.3-375.3) ng/ml, p < 0.0001), respectively. Both ADAM6 and PRSS1 exhibited a very good diagnostic potential by ROC analyses. ADAM6 levels significantly varied between CD22 The results of the current study portray ADAM6 and PRSS1 as new potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in adult acute leukemia patients, and shed light on their role as novel interrelated mediators possibly implicated in tumor micro-environment remodeling.",0
"Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices (absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts (scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.",1
"A higher incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in people with schizophrenia compared to the general population is often suggested. However, it is not clear whether this is a genuine association, and whether it is a direct result of schizophrenia itself, or a side-effect of certain antipsychotics. We undertook a narrative review evaluating how the published literature reports the relationship between LUTS and schizophrenia and its treatments. We searched Embase, Ovid Emcare, and Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL to August 2022, limited to the English language. We selected the following search terms: schizophrenia, schizophrenic, LUTS, overactive bladder, urinary urgency, urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, enuresis, nocturnal enuresis, and voiding dysregulation. We identified seven domains for assessment in advance of commencing the review. These were the categorization, description, and treatment status of schizophrenia; evaluation of LUTS; categorization of LUTS confounders; recapturing of the disease states of both schizophrenia and LUTS after therapies; assessment of the association between LUTS and schizophrenia and/or antipsychotics. The association between LUTS and schizophrenia was poorly described. The evidence was low quality and focused predominantly on urinary incontinence as an antipsychotic side effect, neglecting other LUTS. The status of schizophrenia was often incompletely characterized, and no papers made use of a bladder diary or LUTS-specific questionnaires to assess symptoms. No papers collected information about LUTS in patients not on antipsychotics, nor did any thoroughly evaluate the influence of confounding variables. Despite the tendency of symptoms and severity of both conditions to fluctuate over time, no studies fully assessed the status of both schizophrenia and LUTS at baseline, therapy initiation, and follow-up. It is not possible to state whether there is an association between LUTS and schizophrenia or its treatments. This review highlights the need to improve research and clinical management of the urinary tract in schizophrenia, with meticulously designed longitudinal studies.",0
"The All of Us Research Program is a national effort to enroll ≥1 million participants for health research. The program enables participants to donate Fitbit data, providing a unique dataset for physical activity (PA) and sleep research. This study characterizes Fitbit device data in the All of Us cohort version 8 (v8) data release to facilitate use by researchers. Data were inspected and quality control guardrails were implemented. Days 15-21 (inclusive) post consent date were selected for analysis of demographic characteristics, wear days, and wear time proxy variables. On days 15-21 post consent, the v8 All of Us Fitbit cohort consisted of n = 30,445 participants with PA and/or sleep summary data from 160,487 person-days. Almost all participants (99%) provided both PA and sleep data. The sample consisted of 57% Bring-Your-Own-Device [BYOD] participants and 43% Wearables Enhancing All of Us Research [WEAR] participants provided with a device. Participants were majority Non-Hispanic White (66%) and female (68%). 70% of the sample had ≥5 days of summary data available. Using heart rate data as a proxy for wear, participants averaged 1310 ± 170 min/day of wear time on wear days, or roughly 21 hours and 50 minutes. The Fitbit Charge series were the most common devices worn in the cohort. Considerations for working with All of Us Fitbit data (v8) are discussed and include rolling dates of primary consent, date shift implementation, proprietary Fitbit algorithm, valid day methodology, missing data assumptions, photoplethysmography (PPG) technology, device version data, and population representation.",0

"LC-DAD-ESI/MS was used to identify 23 flavonoids in the extract of Mexican oregano (Lippia graveolens H.B.K.), a spice and herb, used in the USA and Mexico. The identification of luteolin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, phloridzin, taxifolin, eriodictyol, scutellarein, luteolin, quercetin, naringenin, pinocembrin and galangin was confirmed by direct comparison with standards. Identification of 6-hydroxyluteolin, two 6-hydroxyluteolin 7-O-glycosides, three pentahydroxyflavanone hexosides, scutellarein 7-O- hexoside, 3-hydroxyphloretin hexoside, and three other flavones, was made by detailed analysis of their UV and mass spectral data. The identification of the flavonoid glycosides was further confirmed through detection of their aglycones following hydrolysis of the samples. The concentration of the identified flavonoids in three samples was also estimated. This is the first report of detection of over 20 flavonoids, including chalcones, in this plant material.",1
"The concentration of phenols (total, tannins, non-tannin flavonoids, non-tannin non-flavonoids), selected minerals (selenium, zinc and copper) and dextrins were measured in wort and beer produced in Italy. Samples were withdrawn at different phases of beer brewing: wort (step 1), beer at the end of maturation (step 2), filtered beer (step 3), beer after bottling and pasteurization (step 4). On the same samples, the total antioxidant capacity and the inhibitory effect on low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidative modification were tested. Total antioxidant capacity was measured by monitoring the loss of fluorescence of a probe compound. During beer brewing the phenolic concentration decreased by 28% corresponding to a parallel decrease of the antioxidant activity (−29%). This decay was explained by the loss of tannins and non-tannic flavonoids during the technological process. Wort was more efficient than beer in inhibiting LDL oxidation at step 4, both by metal catalyst or peroxyl radicals. However, the better protection provided by both wort and beer on metal-catalyzed LDL oxidation indicates a prevalent chelating action. The data suggest that beer in the diet can supply molecules with antioxidant activity which could play a role in antioxidant activityin vivo.",1
"Ellagitannins (ETs) from pomegranate juice (PJ) are reported to have numerous biological properties, but their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly understood. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of pomegranate ETs, 18 healthy volunteers were given 180 mL of PJ concentrate, and blood samples were obtained for 6 h afterwards. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were obtained on the day before (-1), the day of (0), and the day after (+1) the study. Ellagic acid (EA) was detected in plasma of all subjects with a maximum concentration of 0.06 +/- 0.01 micromol/L, area under concentration time curve of 0.17 +/- 0.02 (micromol x h) x L(-1), time of maximum concentration of 0.98 +/- 0.06 h, and elimination half-life of 0.71 +/- 0.08 h. EA metabolites, including dimethylellagic acid glucuronide (DMEAG) and hydroxy-6H-benzopyran-6-one derivatives (urolithins), were also detected in plasma and urine in conjugated and free forms. DMEAG was found in the urine obtained from 15 of 18 subjects on d 0, but was not detected on d -1 or +1, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker of intake. Urolithin A-glucuronide was found in urine samples from 11 subjects on d 0 and in the urine from 16 subjects on d +1. Urolithin B-glucuronide was found in the urine of 3 subjects on d 0 and in the urine of 5 subjects on d +1. Urolithins, formed by intestinal bacteria, may contribute to the biological effects of PJ as they may persist in plasma and tissues and account for some of the health benefits noted after chronic PJ consumption. Whether genetic polymorphisms in EA-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., catechol-O-methyl transferase and glucuronosyl transferase) are related to variations in response to PJ remains to be established.",1
"An HPLC isocratic elution procedure which allows the separation of flavonol aglycones in wine without interference from other phenolics of low molecular weight is described. The method has been applied to the separation, identification and quantitative estimation of flavonol aglycones in ether extracts of different Spanish wines (red and white table wines and Sherry finos). The results suggest that these determinations, associated with other analyses, would permit the chemical characterization of wines.",1
"The dehydrodiferulic acid content of different common and durum wheat grains and milling fractions was determined by an HPLC procedure. The 8-O-4′, 5–8′ benzofuran, 5–8′ and 5-5′ dehydrodimers were identified in all samples studied and occurred in decreasing relative amounts, respectively. Durum wheats were twice as concentrated in dimers as common wheats. An important genetic variation for dehydrodiferulic acid content was shown within durum wheat grains, whereas the agronomic conditions had no effect. There was 10 to 20 times more dehydrodiferulic acids in external layers (aleurone, bran) than in the starchy endosperm of durum wheat grains. The content and composition in dimers of the inner endosperm did not vary according to genotypes and cultivation conditions. The ratio of dehydrodimers to monomers of ferulic acid which represented an index of dimerisation, was 1·6 times higher in the external layers of the grain than in the endosperm. No relation was found, however, between the degree of ferulic acid dimerisation and the milling behaviour of durum wheat grains.",1
"A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical method, using a combination of ultraviolet-diode array (UV) and electrochemical (EC) detectors, was developed for the characterization and quantification of phenolic and furfural compounds in apple juice. The limits of detection of phenolic compounds with EC detection were 4–500 times greater than those obtained with UV detection. The HPLC method allowed the identification and quantification of the major (chlorogenic and coumaroylquinic acids and phloridzin) and minor (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, gallic and protocatechuic acids, and catechin) phenolic compounds, as well as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde and 2-furaldehyde in apple juice. The total phenolic content in apple juices of various origins varied from 28.85 to 115.49 mg/l. The concentrations of phenolic and furfural compounds varied widely among the non-concentrated and concentrated apple juices.",1
"The metabolic fate of dietary anthocyanins (ACN) has not been fully clarified in humans. In all previous studies, the proportion of total ACN absorbed and excreted in urine was <1% intake. This study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of cyanidin-glucosides (CyG) contained in blood orange juice (BOJ). One liter of BOJ, containing 71 mg CyG, was consumed by 6 healthy, fasting volunteers. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at baseline and at different times up to 24 h after juice consumption. The content of native CyG, glucuronidated/methylated derivatives, and various phenolic acids was determined by HPLC/MS/MS. The serum maximal concentration of cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc) was 1.9 +/- 0.6 nmol/L and that of protocatechuic acid (PCA) was 492 +/- 62 nmol/L at 0.5 h and 2 h after juice consumption, respectively. The calculated total amounts in plasma corresponded for Cy-3-glc to 0.02% and for PCA to 44% of CyG ingested. CyG and glucuronidated/methylated metabolites, but not PCA, were detected in urine. ACN recovered in 24-h urine collections represented approximately 1.2% of the ingested dose. Both CyG (1.90 +/- 0.04 nmol/g) and PCA (277 +/- 0.2 nmol/g) were recovered in 24-h fecal samples. Data explained the metabolic fate of 74% of BOJ ACN. PCA was for the first time, to our knowledge, identified in humans as a CyG metabolite, accounting for almost 73% of ingested CyG. A high concentration of PCA may explain the short-term increased plasma antioxidant activity observed after intake of cyanidin-rich food and it can also contribute to the numerous health benefits attributed to dietary ACN consumption.",1
"Pediatric hematologic malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and various lymphomas, remain among the most prevalent childhood cancers globally. While traditional diagnostic methods - such as morphology, cytochemistry, and immunophenotyping - have improved outcomes over recent decades, they often fail to capture the genetic heterogeneity and subtle prognostic nuances critical for personalized care. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS), have transformed the diagnostic landscape. These tools enable the detection of key genetic alterations, support minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, and guide targeted therapeutic interventions. However, the adoption of these technologies in low-resource settings is challenged by infrastructural, economic, and logistical barriers. This review explores the molecular landscape of pediatric hematologic malignancies, assesses current diagnostic applications, and discusses challenges in resource-limited settings. We also propose actionable recommendations for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers, including strengthening cancer registries with molecular data, establishing regional diagnostic hubs, integrating molecular tools into frontline protocols, and fostering international collaborations to bridge global disparities. By aligning molecular innovation with implementation strategies, we can move toward more equitable and effective care for children affected by hematologic cancers.",0
"In recent years, researchers have been paying special attention to the tumor microenvironment (TME). One of the most important factors contributing to the development and progression of cancer is the destruction of elements of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The most important substances involved in regulating the extracellular matrix degradation process are extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs). In the process of cancer cell migration, chemokines secreted by target tissues, as well as the profile of chemokine receptors presented on cancer cells, play a key role. In the presented work, five components of the TME were selected: MMP-2, MMP-7, TIMP-2, CXCL-9, and CXCL-10. In the years 2018-2021, peripheral blood samples were collected before the start of treatment and then on day 33 of intensive treatment from 31 patients diagnosed with ALL. The results indicate that the levels of MMP-2, MMP-7, and TIMP-2 did not statistically significantly change before and during treatment of ALL patients. The decrease in CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 levels in the patients' serum on the 33rd day of therapy turned out to be statistically significant. Our study indicates that serum is also a valuable material for the evaluation of these substances. Conclusions: CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 could be used as one of markers for monitoring the response to treatment and a potential marker of ALL recurrence in pediatric patients. The role of MMP-2, MMP-7, and TIMP-2 in the assessment of response to therapy in children with ALL has not been confirmed.",0
"An HPLC method for the determination of rosmarinic and caffeic acids in several aromatic herbs, namely, rosemary, sage, thyme, spearmint, balm, and lavender, has been developed and validated. The separation system consisted of a C18 reversed-phase column, a gradient elution system of methanol/water containing orthophosphoric acid, and a photodiode array detector. The content of rosmarinic and caffeic acids was found to be 2.0–27.4, and 0–0.4 mg/g, respectively, in the aromatic herbs analysed. The described method is simple, sensitive, reproducible and ideally suited for rapid routine analysis.",1
"Adult thoracolumbar kyphosis secondary to osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVF) impairs the quality of life. Traditional 3CO provides correction but carries a high risk of complications, especially in the elderly. Minimally invasive anterior approaches may be safer. This study aims to compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes of septuagenarians with thoracolumbar kyphosis treated with single-position navigated lateral column realignment with anterior longitudinal ligament release (LCR-A) plus posterior column osteotomy (PCO) and posterior spinal fusion (PSF), or percutaneous pedicle screws (PPS) versus three-column osteotomy (3CO). This retrospective study included 21 patients with LCR-A and 54 with 3CO prospectively treated between March 2020 and April 2024. Radiographic parameters, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), SRS-22 scores, complications, and perioperative data were analyzed over a 2-year follow-up period. Although LCR-A patients were older, they had significantly reduced blood loss, shorter operative times, and fewer fused levels than 3CO patients. LCR-A achieved comparable deformity correction, with fewer complications, lower postoperative ODI, and better SRS-22 scores. The LCR-A group maintained radiographic correction, with fewer new neurological deficits and lower rates of infection, ileus, and delirium. Single-position navigated LCR-A is a safer and less invasive alternative to 3CO in elderly patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis, offering effective deformity correction, fewer complications, improved functional outcomes, and enhanced recovery.

"Quantitative analysis of anthocyanins was performed on a series of blood orange juices according to various spectrophotometric and HPLC methods, and the causes for different concentration resulting from the application of such procedures were investigated. Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice producing factories.",1
"The effect of processing of coated and dehulled sesame seeds on the content of endogenous antioxidants, namely sesamin, sesamolin, and γ-tocopherol in hexane-extracted oils, was studied over 35 d of storage under Schaal oven test conditions at 65°C. Seeds examined were Egyptian coated (EC) and dehulled (ED) and Sudanese coated (SC) varieties. Processing conditions of raw (RW) seeds included roasting at 200°C for 20 min (R), steaming at 100°C for 20 min (S), roasting at 200°C for 15 min plus steaming for 7 min (RS) and microwaving at 2450 MHz for 15 min (M). The sesamin content in fresh oils from EC, ED, and SC raw seeds was 649, 610, and 580 mg/100 g oil, respectively. Corresponding values for the content of sesamolin in oils tested were 183, 168 and 349 mg/100 g oil, respectively. Meanwhile, the content of γ-tocopherol, the only tocopherol present in the oils, ranged from 330 to 387 mg/kg sample. The effect of processing on changes in the sesamin content in oils from coated seeds was low and generally did not exceed 20% of the original values. On the other hand, oils from dehulled seeds underwent a more pronounced decrease in their sesamin content than the oil from coated seeds after 35 d of storage at 65°C. The corresponding changes in sesamolin and γ-tocopherol contents were more drastic. The RS treatment, which would be the optimal to prepare sesame oil with better quality, was found to retain 86, 80 and 60% of the sesamin, sesamolin and γ-tocopherol, respectively, originally present in the seeds after the storage period. The loss in the content of endogenous antioxidants present in the oils paralleled an increase in their hexanal content.",1
"Flavonoids are known to possess a broad set of pharmacological effects, some of which have been attributed to their antioxidant properties and, more recently, to cell signalling modulation. Nevertheless, flavonoids are extensively metabolized and their metabolites are the potential bioactive forms in vivo. Therefore, a first and crucial step to understand the mechanisms underlying potential health benefits of flavonoids is knowledge of their metabolites and their biological activities.",1
"Pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (ALL/LL) and obesity are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The PREVAPIX-ALL trial was an open-label, randomized, controlled trial assessing the safety and efficacy of apixaban for VTE prevention in pediatric patients with ALL/LL. An a priori subgroup analysis of patients with obesity in the PREVAPIX-ALL trial was planned because of increased VTE risk in this group. Patients with obesity, aged ≥2 to <18 years, central venous catheter, and chemotherapy containing asparaginase were randomized to apixaban (prophylactic dose) vs standard of care (SOC; no anticoagulation) during induction chemotherapy. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of nonfatal symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE and VTE-related death. The primary and secondary safety outcomes were major bleeding and a composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding, respectively. A total of 82 PREVAPIX-ALL participants presented with obesity, of whom 42 were randomized to apixaban. For the primary efficacy end point, a significant decrease in VTE events was present in the apixaban arm (1/42 [2.4%]) as compared with the SOC arm (10/40 [25%]; relative risk [RR], 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.97; P = .007). There was a statistically significant treatment obesity interaction, P = .03. No statistically significant difference was observed for the primary efficacy end point among the nonobese group (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.53-1.37; P = .50). No statistically significant difference in major or CRNM bleeding was observed. Apixaban prophylaxis in patients with obesity and ALL/LL resulted in a statistically significant VTE risk reduction with no increase bleeding. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02369653.",0

"Typical HPLC profiles of phenolics from head lettuce (butter lettuce) genotypes showed quercetin (Qu) compounds Qu 3-O-glucuronide, Qu 3-O-(6-malonylglucoside), an acidic luteolin (Lu) glycoside, chlorogenic acid and chicoric acid as the main compounds in outer and – except the Lu conjugate – inner leaves.The outer leaves of some genotypes additionally contained cyanidin 3-O-(6-malonylglucoside). The generally marginal flavonoid concentrations of the cores of lettuce heads increased between 10-fold and 20-fold during the illumination of opened inner leaves. This indicated the competence of inner leaves of lettuce heads to perform the light-dependent flavonoid biosynthesis. After hydrolysis of flavonoid extracts from 15 head lettuce varieties, Qu concentrations were detected between 19.4 and 152.1 µg/g dry plant material (DW) in inner leaves and from 417.3 to 2482.7 µg/g DW in outer leaves. While the Qu concentrations of the inner leaves of most genotypes, including the commercial varieties, amounted to about 3% of those found in outer leaves, these proportions were 15% and 19% in two genotypes. Two other varieties showed relatively high Qu values of cores in connection with maximum flavonoid levels of outer leaves. It is indicated that such genotypes may be useful in increasing the flavonoid concentrations in the inner leaves of commercial head lettuce varieties by conventional breeding methods.",1
"Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2 (NRAMP 2; also known as DMT1 and encoded by SLC11A2) is mainly known for its iron transport activity. Recently, the DMT1 isoform lacking the iron-response element (nonIRE) was associated with aberrant NOTCH pathway activity. In this report, we investigated the function of DMT1 nonIRE in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Knockdown of Dmt1 nonIRE in mice showed that it has non-canonical functions in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation: its knockdown suppressed development along the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, while promoting the production of platelets. These phenotypic effects on the hematopoietic system induced by Dmt1 nonIRE knockdown were linked to suppression of Notch/Myc pathway activity. Conversely, our data indicate a non-canonical function for DMT1 nonIRE overexpression in boosting NOTCH pathway activity in T-cell leukemia homeobox protein 1 (TLX1)-defective leukemia. This work sets the stage for future investigation using a multiple-hit T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model to further investigate the function of DMT1 nonIRE in T-ALL disease development and progression.",0
"This investigation was designed to characterize phenolic metabolism of the olive cultivar, Hardy's Mammoth, by examining its constitutive tissues. The phenolic profiles of pulp, seed, stone, and new and old season leaves were monitored over two fruiting seasons, to investigate possible relationships between tissues and phenol content and to determine the impact of alternate fruit bearing. No major qualitative differences in phenolic composition were found between the various tissues; however, distinct differences between the tissues with respect to quantifiable phenols were established. Relationships between 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl (3E,4E)-4-formyl-3-(2-oxoethyl)hex-4-enoate ester, oleuropein, and hydroxytyrosol in pulp and leaf were identified and found to be related to alternate bearing. Concentrations of 5-caffeoylquinic acid in old season leaves differed dramatically between seasons, confirming earlier studies.",1
"Three different methods (antiradical activity, inhibition of primary oxidation, and ferric reducing power) have been used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of eight different asparagus cultivars and byproducts: white and green asparagus from Alcalá del Río (Guadalquivir Valley, Seville) and American hybrids, native spears, and their byproducts from Huétor-Tájar (Vega de Granada). The correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenol content was studied. Six standards were also tested to validate the modified methods for antioxidant activity determination. Results obtained for antiradical capacity and reducing power were very similar, and a high correlation with phenols was found (R > or = 0.9 for both tests). Sample origin was an important factor, spears from Huétor-Tájar having higher values (ARC between 7 and 10 and P(R) of 0.25-0.33) than those from Alcalá del Río (ARC 0.6-2 and P(R) of 0.05-0.07). Significant differences were found between spears with the same origin, suggesting that genetics are another factor to take into account. Asparagus inhibits lipid primary oxidation, but no correlation between the inhibition percentage and phenols was observed. Asparagus origin was the only factor that led to significant differences: samples from Huétor-Tájar had higher values (POIC between 18 and 32) than those from Alcalá del Río (POIC of 5-9). Byproducts from the canning industry at Huétor-Tájar were also assayed for antioxidant activity; the results obtained suggested that byproducts could be considered as an excellent source of natural antioxidants.",1
"Pomegranate juice (PJ), a rich source of polyphenols including ellagitannins, has attracted much attention due to its reported health benefits. This has resulted in the consumption of liquid and powder pomegranate extracts as alternatives to PJ. Therefore establishing the bioavailability of polyphenols from these extract preparations is necessary. Sixteen healthy volunteers sequentially consumed, with a 1-week washout period between treatments, PJ (8 ounces, Wonderful fruit variety), a pomegranate polyphenol liquid extract (POMxl, 8 ounces), and a pomegranate polyphenol powder extract (POMxp, 1,000 mg). The three interventions provided 857, 776, and 755 mg of polyphenols as gallic acid equivalents, respectively. Plasma bioavailability, judged based on ellagic acid levels over a 6-hour period, did not show statistical differences in area under the curve for the three interventions: 0.14 +/- 0.05, 0.11 +/- 0.03, and 0.11 +/- 0.04 micromol . hour/L for PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, respectively. The time of maximum concentration was delayed for POMxp (2.58 +/- 0.42 hours) compared to PJ (0.65 +/- 0.23 hours) and POMxl (0.94 +/- 0.06 hours). Urolithin-A glucuronide, a urinary metabolite of ellagic acid, was not significantly different with the three interventions, reaching levels of approximately 1,000 ng/mL. This study demonstrates that ellagitannin metabolites, delivered from pomegranate fruits, as PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, reach equivalent levels with a delay in time of maximum concentration of POMxp compared to PJ and POMxl.",1
"The present study examines and compares the phenolic compositions of several commercially available alcohol-free and standard beers. In general, the values for the contents of the phenolic components in the alcohol-free beers are lower than the values for the standard beers; this is attributable to differences in the duration of fermentation and the yeast strains employed in brewing alcohol-free beers (e.g., the case of tyrosol) and to losses brought about by the dealcoholization processes employed (e.g., p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, etc.). The values for the other low-molecular-weight compounds considered, such as 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural and tryptophol, are also lower in the alcohol-free than in the standard beers.",1
"Relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; T-ALL)/lymphoma (LBL) represent a significant unmet medical need. WU-CART-007 is a CD7-targeting, allogeneic, fratricide-resistant chimeric antigen receptor T-cell product generated from healthy donor T cells. WU-CART-007 was evaluated in a phase 1/2 study with a 3+3 dose-escalation design followed by cohort expansion in relapsed/refractory T-ALL/LBL. Patients received 1 infusion of WU-CART-007 after standard or enhanced lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The primary objectives, to characterize safety and assess the composite complete remission rate, were met. Of 28 patients enrolled, 13 received the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 900 × 106 cells of WU-CART-007 with enhanced lymphodepletion. The most common treatment-related adverse event was cytokine release syndrome (88.5%; 19.2% grade 3-4). Two grade 1 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome events (7.7%) and 1 grade 2 acute graft-versus-host disease event occurred (3.8%). One grade 2 immune effector cell-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome was observed. Among the 11 patients evaluable for response at the RP2D who received enhanced lymphodepleting chemotherapy, the overall response rate was 90.9%, and the composite complete remission rate was 72.7%. WU-CART-007 at the RP2D demonstrated a high response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory T-ALL/LBL and has the potential to provide a new treatment option. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT04984356.",0
"Methanol extracts of olive pomace (two-phase olive oil extraction) and olive pulp were analysed by reverse phase HPLC and the eluted fractions were characterised by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. This technique allowed the identification of some common phenolic compounds, namely, verbascoside, rutin, caffeoyl-quinic acid, luteolin-4-glucoside and 11-methyl-oleoside. Hydroxytyrosol-1′-β-glucoside, luteolin-7-rutinoside and oleoside were also detected. Moreover, this technique enabled the identification, for the first time in Olea europaea tissues, of two oleoside derivatives, 6′-β-glucopyranosyl-oleoside and 6′-β-rhamnopyranosyl-oleoside, and of 10-hydroxy-oleuropein. Also, an oleuropein glucoside that had previously been identified in olive leaves was now detected in olive fruit, both in olive pulp and olive pomace. With the exception of oleoside and oleuropein, the majority of phenolic compounds were found to occur in equivalent amounts in olive pulp and olive pomace. Oleoside was the main phenolic compound in olive pulp (31.6 mg g−1) but was reduced to 3.6 mg g−1 in olive pomace, and oleuropein (2.7 mg g−1 in the pulp) almost disappeared (<0.1 mg g−1 in the pomace). Both these phenolic compounds were degraded during the olive oil extraction process.",1
"The upregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL), 2 proteins in the BCL2 family of proteins, leads to a disproportional expression of prodeath and prosurvival proteins in favor of leukemia survival, tumorigenesis, and chemoresistance. In different subsets of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the proportion of these 2 proteins varies, and their potential as therapeutic targets needs detailed characterization. Here, we investigated BCL2 and BCL-XL, the genes that encode BCL2 and BCL-XL, and their expression differences between B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and T-cell ALL (T-ALL). We also evaluated the therapeutic potential of targeting these proteins with AZD0466, a novel drug-dendrimer conjugate of the BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor AZD4320, and with BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199). Gene expression and activity analyses supported by the protein expression patterns in ALL cell lines and primary samples demonstrated increased levels of BCL2 expression in B-ALL, with high sensitivity to venetoclax or AZD4320. In contrast, strong BCL-XL expression and sensitivity to dual BCL2/BCL-XL inhibition was observed specifically in T-ALL samples. This observation was confirmed by BH3 profiling, demonstrating BCL2/BCL-XL codependence in T-ALL and BCL2 dependence in B-ALL. In a mouse model of T-ALL, AZD0466 but not venetoclax reduced leukemic burden and prolonged survival without significant toxicities. Our findings therefore suggest that the novel dual BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor AZD0466 outperforms single BCL2 inhibition by venetoclax in T-ALL. These findings facilitate the translation of dual BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitors into ALL clinical trials, either alone or in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy and immune therapies.",0
"Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is a sinister complication encountered in patients with haematological disorders. When occurring in the central nervous system (CNS), IFDs can have catastrophic outcomes. To study the clinical presentation, predisposing etiological factors, and prognosis of a CNS-IFD in a patient with a haematological disorder. This is a retrospective study focusing on the clinical profile, diagnosis, treatment strategy and outcomes of 43 patients with an underlying haematological disorder, who were diagnosed with CNS-IFD between 2018 and 2022. Of the 43 patients, 18 were chemotherapy recipients, while 23 were stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients and 2 presented with CNS-IFD at diagnosis. AML/MDS (37.2%) and ALL (18.6%) were the predominant underlying diagnoses. A sudden deterioration in sensorium (53.5%) was the earliest clinical sign, while T2 hyperintensities (26.8%), vascular involvement (26.8%) and ring-enhancing lesions (16.3%) were the commonest radiological findings, with all patients exhibiting diffusion restriction in diffusion-weighted images. Microbiological evidence of infection was obtained in all patients; however, culture positivity was established in only 25 patients. Rhizopus spp (23.2%) and Aspergillus spp (20.9%) were implicated in most cases. Overall survival of the cohort was 27.9% at a median follow-up of 6 months. In patients who succumbed, the median time to death was 4 days (0-46). CNS-IFD is associated with very poor survival in patients undergoing chemotherapy or an SCT, urging the need for prompt diagnosis and initiation of suitable antifungal therapy.",0

"Chlorogenic acid is reported to be involved in preharvest defenses of the potato plant against fungi and insects, in postharvest browning, and in after-cooking blackening, all of which affect quality and safety. As part of a program of potato improvement, HPLC and ultraviolet spectroscopy were evaluated to measure the chlorogenic content of commercial and experimental potatoes, of parts of the potato plant, and of processed potato products. HPLC analysis appears to be less satisfactory because chlorogenic acid undergoes a time- and light-dependent change in the methanolic and ethanolic extracts of potatoes used. The decrease of the chlorogenic acid peak on chromatograms was accompanied by a corresponding increase of a new peak. Use of ultraviolet spectrophotometry to estimate chlorogenic acid by contrast appears to be reproducible. Recoveries of spiked samples measured by UV were higher than those measured by HPLC. Thus, our results suggest that the UV method may have advantages over HPLC. Seven varieties of potatoes contained from 10 to 19 mg of chlorogenic acid/100 g of fresh weight. The experimental potato plant NDA 1725 contained 754 mg/100 g of fresh weight for sprouts, 224 mg/100 g for leaves, 26 mg/100 g for roots, and 17 mg/100 g for tubers. The relative concentrations paralleled those of the glycoalkaloids alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine. Oven-baked potatoes contained 0% of the original amount of chlorogenic acid, boiled potatoes 35%, and microwaved potatoes 55% Commercially processed french-fried potatoes, mashed potato flakes, and potato skins contained no chlorogenic acid. The absence of chlorogenic acid was confirmed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and thin-layer chromatography. The significance of these findings for plant physiology, food quality, and food safety is discussed.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive subtype of ALL characterized by its high heterogeneity and unfavorable clinical features. Despite improved insights in genetic and epigenetic landscapes of T-ALL, the molecular mechanisms that drive malignant T-cell development remain unclear. BTB and CNC homology 2 (BACH2) is a lymphoid-specific transcription repressor recognized as a tumor suppressor in B-cell malignancies, but little is known about its function and regulatory network in T-ALL. Here we found extremely low levels of BACH2 in T-ALL clinical samples and cell lines compared to normal T cells. Overexpression of BACH2 in T-ALL cells not only induced cell growth retardation but also inhibited cancer progression and infiltration in xenografts. Further RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed significant alterations in regulation of defense and immune responses in T-ALL cells upon BACH2 overexpression. Strikingly, CD28 and CD40LG, two essential stimulatory molecules on T cells, were for the first time identified as novel downstream targets repressed by BACH2 in T-ALL cells. Interestingly, both CD28 and CD40LG were indispensable for T-ALL survival, since largely or completely silencing CD28 and CD40LG led to rapid cell death, whereas partial knockdown of them resulted in cell-cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis. More importantly, BACH2-mediated CD28 and CD40LG signals contributed to cell migration and dissemination of T-ALL cells to the bone marrow, thus adding a new layer to the BACH2-mediated tumor immunoregulation in T-cell malignancies.",0
"Medically refractory cases of trigeminal neuralgia often require treatment escalation. Surgical options include microvascular decompression and percutaneous ablation. This paper provides a bibliometric analysis of the most influential articles on the surgical management of trigeminal neuralgia. The Web of Science database was queried to identify the top 100 cited articles concerning surgical treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The search terms used included ALL=((""trigeminal neuralgia"" OR ""tic douloureux"" OR ""Fothergill's disease"" OR ""Trifacial neuralgia"") AND (""surgical treatment"" OR ""surgical management"" OR ""surgery"" OR ""neurosurgery"") NOT (""radiosurgery"" OR ""gamma knife"")). The extracted variables included the first and senior author names, journal, publication year, institution, and surgical modality. Our bibliometric search yielded 2104 studies, with 41,502 citations overall. Within the top 100 articles, Zakrzewska had the most first author papers (n = 5), and Burchiel had the most senior author papers (n = 6). The Massachusetts General Hospital was the most represented institution (n = 5). The United States was the most represented country (51%). Microvascular decompression was the most studied surgical strategy (51%), followed by percutaneous radiofrequency coagulation (9%), balloon/nerve compression (7%), and glycerol rhizolysis (7%). Some studies assessed multiple treatment modalities (22%). The types of studies included retrospective articles (58%), prospective articles (26%), reviews (10%), anatomic studies (2%), and basic science (1%). Neurosurgery (35%) and the Journal of Neurosurgery (33%) were the most represented journals. The current literature consists of retrospective reviews and mostly describes microvascular decompression for trigeminal neuralgia. Future studies should include further characterization of other surgical modalities such as percutaneous radiofrequency thermocoagulation, glycerol injection, and balloon compression.",0
"This study seeks to elucidate the association between HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 alleles and their relative risk contributions to ALL within an Iranian cohort. Utilizing a robust case-control design, this research involved 71 ALL patients and 71 age and sex-matched healthy individuals. Genotyping of specified HLA alleles was performed using the advanced PCR-SSP technique. Our findings reveal a marked increase in the prevalence of the HLA-DRB1*04 allele among patients diagnosed with ALL compared to the control group (P<0.027). Conversely, the alleles HLA-A*26 (P=0.025), HLA-A*33 (P=0.020), and HLA-DRB1*03 (P=0.035) were observed at significantly reduced frequencies within the patient population. Our findings highlight HLA-DRB1*04 as a potential genetic marker for increased susceptibility to ALL, while HLA-A*26, HLA-A*33, and HLA-DRB1*03 emerge as protective factors.",0
"This study evaluated the benefits and risks of patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia (R/R ALL) treated with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and blinatumomab. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. The pooled complete remission (CR) rate and minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate were 48%, 31% for blinatumomab, and 86% and 80% for CAR T-cell therapy. The CAR T-cell therapy group exhibited a higher likelihood of CR rate than the blinatumomab group in every analysis regardless of adjustment subgroups. CAR T-cell therapy was associated with a significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with blinatumomab (2-year OS 55% vs 25%; 2-year RFS 40% vs 22%). CAR T-cell therapy was more effective for achieving CR and bridging to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) than blinatumomab (2-year OS 75% vs. 57%). An emerging role for blinatumomab is as a bridging agent pre-SCT, and for patients who achieve an MRD-negative state pre-SCT, post-SCT outcomes are expected to be the same as CAR-T. For adverse effects (AEs), blinatumomab was associated with a lower rate of grade ≥3 hematological toxicity, CRS, and neurological events.",0
"White bean seeds were subjected to soaking in distilled water for 1, 2 and 3 days. In order to perform complete processing, the seeds were cooked until soft. Effects of soaking and/or cooking of white bean seeds on antinutritional factors, mineral contents and HCl-extractability were studied. Phytic acid and polyphenol contents of all cultivars were reduced. Soaking alone and soaking, followed by cooking, reduced mineral contents of the cultivars, but HCl-extractability was significantly (P⩽0.01) improved to varying extents, depending on cultivar type. Soaking and/or cooking treatment was thus found to be an effective technique and caused further improvement in the availability of both major and trace minerals in white bean.",1
"Programmed death-1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have a vital role in immune checkpoint pathways. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PD1 and CTLA4 have been reported to be associated with susceptibility to certain autoimmune diseases and cancers. The potential association between SNPs in these immune checkpoint genes and risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) still unclear. The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of PD1 and CTLA4 SNPs on the risk of developing ALL and the prognosis of the disease. The study was performed on 100 pediatric B-ALL patients and 100 controls. The PD1 and CTLA4 SNPs were examined by RFLP technique. The study revealed that CTLA4 (rs11571316) was associated with high risk of B-ALL developments OR 1.492 (CI: 1157 to 1924) ( P =0.002). PD1 (rs36084323) GA genotype was significantly associated with protective effect against nonremission ( P =0.007). PD1 (rs36084323) A allele were associated with protective effect against relapse ( P =0.008). CTLA4 and PD1 genotypes did not have significant impact on B-ALL patients outcome. The current study displayed for the first time that genetic variations of the CTLA-4, was associated with susceptibility to B-ALL and that PD1 (rs36084323) GA genotype was significantly associated with protective effect against nonremission, while PD1 (rs36084323) A allele was associated with protective effect against relapse.",0
"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction remains associated with the risk of re-rupture and persisting rotational instability. Additional extraarticular anterolateral stabilization procedures stabilize the tibial internal rotation and lead to lower ACL failure rate and improved knee stability. However, data for additional stabilization of tibial external rotation is lacking and the importance of an anteromedial stabilization procedure is less well evaluated. Aim of this study is to investigate the influence of an extraarticular anteromedial stabilization procedure for the stabilization of the tibial external rotation and protection of the ACL from these rotational forces. Internal and external rotations of the tibia were applied to a finite element (FE) model with anatomical ACL, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL) and intact medial and lateral meniscus. Five additional anatomic structures (Anteromedial stabilization/anteromedial ligament, AML, augmented superficial medial collateral ligament, sMCL, posterior oblique ligament, POL, anterolateral ligament, ALL, and popliteal tendon, PLT) were added to the FE model separately and then combined. The force histories within all structures were measured and determined for each case. The anteromedial stabilization or imaginary AML was the main secondary stabilizer of tibial external rotation (90% of overall ACL force reduction). The AML reduced the load on the ACL by 9% in tibial external rotation which could not be achieved by an augmented sMCL (-1%). The AML had no influence in tibial internal rotation (-1%). In the combined measurements with all additional structures (AML, ALL, PLT, POL) the load on the ACL was reduced by 10% in tibial external rotation. This study showed that an additional anteromedial stabilization procedure secures the tibial external rotation and has the most protective effect on the ACL during these external rotational forces.",0
"To profile absorption of Astragali Radix decoction and identify its orally absorbable constituents and their metabolites, four complementary in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods, i.e., a computational chemistry prediction method, a Caco-2 cell monolayer model experiment, an improved rat everted gut sac experiment, and a healthy human volunteer experiment, were used. According to the in silico computation result, 26 compounds of Astragali Radix could be regarded as orally available compounds, including 12 flavonoids. In the in vitro and in vivo experiments, 21 compounds were tentatively identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ion trap tandem mass spectrometry data, which involved calycosin, formononetin, (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan, 7,2′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan, calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucoside, formononetin-7-O-β-d-glucoside, 7,2′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-β-d-glucoside-6″-O-malonate, (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-β-d-glucoside, and phase II metabolites calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, formononetin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-β-d-glucuronide, 7,2′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, and calycosin sulfate. Calycosin and formononetin were proved absorbable by four methods; (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan and 7,2′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan were proved absorbable by three methods; formononetin-7-O-β-d-glucoside and (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-β-d-glucoside were proved absorbable by two methods. The existence of calycosin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, formononetin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-β-d-glucuronide, 7,2′-dihydroxy-3′,4′-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-β-d-glucuronide, and calycosin sulfate was proved by two or three methods. We found that besides isoflavones, pterocarpans and isoflavans also could be metabolized by the intestine during absorption, and the major metabolites were glucuronides. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the flavonoids in Astragali Radix decoction, including isoflavones, pterocarpans, and isoflavans, could be absorbed and metabolized by the intestine. These absorbable compounds, which were reported to have various bioactivities related to the curative effects of Astragali Radix decoction, could be regarded as an important component of the effective constituents of Astragali Radix decoction.",1
"Three ADCs: Mylotarg, Besponda and Lumoxiti have improved overall survival and event=free survival as well as reduced relapse in 3 types of Leukaemia: AML, ALL and HCL, respectively. Lessons from these three SOC successful ADCs should guide other new ADCs in addressing the ADC-related off target toxicity due to the cytotoxic payload that limits their therapeutic index by using the successful approach of administrating lower doses in a fractionated regimen over time in separate days of the cycle to reduce the severity and frequency of the ADC-related serious toxicities that include ocular damage, long-term peripheral neuropathy and hepatic toxicity etc.",0
"Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was much less significant.",1
"PurposeLimited data are available on the cardiorespiratory and muscle fitness of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during chemotherapy. This pilot study evaluated the safety of testing the cardiorespiratory and muscle fitness of two children with ALL at different risk levels in early chem treatment.MethodsTwo girls with low- and high-risk B-cell ALL (DFCI-16-001) took part in two test sessions: T1 (induction, consolidation 1A/C) and T2 (consolidation 2).

"Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.",1
"At the 10th European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL), the guidelines for antifungal prophylaxis in pediatric and adult patients with hematological malignancies (HM) were updated and some changes introduced. Regarding acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients undergoing remission induction chemotherapy, a B-II grading has been assigned to isavuconazole, micafungin, and caspofungin, based on non-randomized studies that have shown efficacy in preventing invasive fungal diseases (IFD). Regarding high-risk MDS patients treated with azacytidine, prophylaxis with posaconazole during the first four cycles of treatment is supported in the literature. Prophylaxis is not indicated in patients treated for myeloproliferative neoplasms (NPM), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). For patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), prophylaxis is not generally indicated. For patients with multiple myeloma (MM), prophylaxis is not indicated and the limited epidemiological data available do not support the use of prophylaxis in subjects treated with bispecific antibodies. For patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), no substantial changes were made, apart from the addition of isavuconazole with grading B-II in the post-engraftment period. In patients undergoing auto-HSCT, antifungal prophylaxis is not indicated. Previous ECIL guidelines did not include CAR-T cells. The expert panel proposes to endorse the use of anti-mold prophylaxis in high-risk patients during pre-infusion and post-infusion, while in low-risk patients, anti-yeast prophylaxis can be recommended (B-II). For pediatric hematology patients, based on newly published data, caspofungin received a B-I grading as mold-active prophylaxis. Moreover, patients with ALL with insufficient treatment response during induction therapy, and children older than 12 y.o are now considered at high risk for IFD and are recommended to receive antifungal prophylaxis.",0
"Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.",1
"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy that is still fatal in many cases. T cell blasts are characterized by hyperactivation and strong proliferative and migratory capacities. The chemokine receptor CXCR4 is involved in mediating malignant T cell properties, and cortactin has been shown to control CXCR4 surface localization in T-ALL cells. We have previously shown that cortactin overexpression is correlated with organ infiltration and relapse in B-ALL. However, the role of cortactin in T cell biology and T-ALL remains elusive. Here, we analyzed the functional relevance of cortactin for T cell activation and migration and the implications for T-ALL development. We found that cortactin is upregulated in response to T cell receptor engagement and recruited to the immune synapse in normal T cells. Loss of cortactin caused reduced IL-2 production and proliferation. Cortactin-depleted T cells showed defects in immune synapse formation and migrated less due to impaired actin polymerization in response to T cell receptor and CXCR4 stimulation. Leukemic T cells expressed much higher levels of cortactin compared to normal T cells that correlated with greater migratory capacity. Xenotransplantation assays in NSG mice revealed that cortactin-depleted human leukemic T cells colonized the bone marrow significantly less and failed to infiltrate the central nervous system, suggesting that cortactin overexpression drives organ infiltration, which is a major complication of T-ALL relapse. Thus, cortactin could serve as a potential therapeutic target for T-ALL and other pathologies involving aberrant T cell responses.",0
"Current guidelines recommend computed tomography (cCT) scans of the chest in children with leukemia following 96 h of the onset of idiopathic neutropenia to eliminate pulmonary invasive fungal infections (IFIs). However, cCT exposes some children who are at a very high risk of developing secondary cancers to radiation. We aimed to determine the effect of antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) with voriconazole (VCZ) on the need for cCT scans in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to eliminate pulmonary IFIs during chemotherapy. We retrospectively screened all patients' data from their electronic charts. Children who were diagnosed as having ALL before February 2013 and did (AFP group) or did not (NoP group) receive AFP were divided into two groups and compared regarding cCT scans and relapse-mortality rates. Ninety-six children were diagnosed before February 2013 and did not receive primary AFP and 146 children were administered VCZ following a diagnosis of ALL. There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. A total of 128 cCTs had been required in 62 children in the NoP group, compared with 64 cCTs in 52 children in the AFP group. The percentage of the patients who had required at least one chest CT scan and the mean number of cCT scans in the NoP group were significantly higher compared with the AFP group. Proven-probable IFIs and relapse-mortality rates were higher in the NoP group compared with the AFP group. Mold-active AFP revealed a significant decrease in the need for cCT scans in children with ALL.",0
"We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and diode array detection to determine four biologically active phenolic constituents of red wines: gallic acid, trans-resveratrol, quercetin and rutin. The method permits direct injection without sample pre-treatment. ODS Hypersil served as the stationary phase; the gradient was formed by acetic acid, methanol, and water. Each analysis required an equilibration period of 10 min and a run time of 50 min for completion. Previously, total phenols were analysed according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, using gallic acid as the standard, and the results are given as gallic acid equivalent.",1
"In this registry-based study, we compared outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) transplanted in first complete remission (CR-1), following conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI) at a standard 12-Gray or at a lower 8-Gray total dose. Patients received fludarabine (flu) as the sole chemotherapy complementing TBI. Eight-Gray TBI/flu was used in 494 patients and 12-Gray TBI/flu in 145 patients. Eighty-eight (23.1%) and 36 (29%) of the patients had Ph-negative B-ALL, 222 (58.3%) and 53 (42.7%) had Ph-positive B-ALL, 71 (18.6%) and 35 (28.2%) T-ALL, respectively (",0
"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), with patients now achieving life expectancy comparable to the general population. Despite the contraindication of TKIs during the first trimester of pregnancy, their effects on female reproductive health remain underexplored. This pilot case-control study evaluated the impact of Dasatinib on the female reproductive system in 25 women with CML or Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL), compared to 25 age-matched controls. Clinical histories, gynecological examinations, transvaginal ultrasonography, and serum Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) assessments were performed. There was no significant differences in menstrual cycle characteristics between patients and controls, although 12% of patients experienced shorter cycles and 8% reported heavier menstrual flow after initiating Dasatinib.

"A high-performance liquid chromatography method employing diode array detection was developed to determine levels of the major catechins present in black, green, and Jasmine tea infusions. Reversed-phase separations were performed on a C18 column using three gradients: acetonitrile-acetate buffer, methanol-acetate buffer, and acetonitrile-acetate buffer with ascorbic acid. The identities of the tea catechins were established by comparing absorbance spectra and retention times to reference standards chromatographed under identical conditions. Epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate were found in all the tea infusions examined, ranging in concentration from 1-13 mg dl-1. These levels indicate that even moderate tea consumption can contribute a substantial quantity of flavanols to the diet. Although some differences between the three brewed teas were evident, all were comparably good sources of these catechins.",1
"Among youths, pathological irritability is highly prevalent and severely disabling. As a frequent symptom, it often leads to referrals to child and adolescent mental health services. Self-regulatory control (SRC) processes are a set of socio-psycho-physiological processes that allow individuals to adapt to their ever-changing environments. This conceptual framework may enhance the current understanding of the cognitive, emotional, behavioural and social dysregulations underlying irritability. The present systematic review (PROSPERO registration: #CRD42022370390) aims to synthesize existing studies that examine irritability through the lens of SRC processes among youths (< 18 years of age). We conducted a comprehensive literature search among six bibliographic databases: Embase.com, Medline ALL Ovid, APA PsycInfo Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Wiley and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I. Additional searches were performed using citation tracing strategies. The retrieved reports totalled 2612, of which we included 82 (i.e., articles) from 74 studies. More than 85% of reports were published during the last 6 years, highlighting the topicality of this work. The studies sampled n = 26,764 participants (n = 12,384 girls and n = 12,905 boys, n = 1475 no information) with an average age of 8.08 years (SD = 5.26). The included reports suggest that irritability has an association with lower effortful control, lower cognitive control and delay intolerance. Further, evidence indicates both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between irritability and a lack of regulation skills for positive and negative emotions, particularly anger. Physiological regulation seems to moderate the association between irritability and psychopathology. Finally, the mutual influence between a child's irritability and parenting practice has been established in several studies. This review uses the lens of SRC to illustrate the current understanding of irritability in psychopathology, discusses important gaps in the literature, and highlights new avenues for further research.",0
"The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a simultaneous intake of food and anthocyanins (ACNs) on ACN absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Blackcurrant ACNs (BcACNs) were dissolved in water with or without the addition of oatmeal and orally administered to rats, providing approximately 250 mg total ACNs per kilogram BW. Blood, urine, digesta, and tissue samples of the stomach, jejunum, and colon were subsequently collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 24 h. Identification and quantification of ACNs were carried out by Reversed phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Four major ACNs were present in the blackcurrant extract: delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside. In plasma, the 4 ACNs of blackcurrant were identified and quantified. The time to reach maximal total ACN plasma concentration (C(max) BcACN/water = 0.37 +/- 0.07 micromol/L; C(max) BcACN/oatmeal = 0.20 +/- 0.05 micromol/L) occurred faster after BcACN/water (t(max)= 0.25 h), than after BcACN/oatmeal administration (t(max)= 1.0 h). In digesta and tissue samples, the 4 original blackcurrant ACNs were detected. The relative concentration of rutinosides in the digesta increased during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract, while the glucosides decreased. Maximum ACN excretion in urine occurred later after BcACN/oatmeal than after BcACN/water administration (3 compared with 2 h). The 4 original ACNs of blackcurrant in their unchanged form, as well as several metabolites, were identified in the urine samples of both groups. The simultaneous intake of food affects ACN absorption and excretion in the urine, but not metabolism.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a hematopoietic cancer of T or B lymphoblasts, is the most prevalent cancer in children. Ongoing research aims to better understand the factors contributing to ALL and create more successful treatment options. Therefore, the current study presented cytogenetic, genetic, and hematologic features from 318 ALL patients under eighteen years of age who were referred to Ali Asghar Hospital of Tehran, Iran, from 2013 to 2023. This study was designed as a retrospective cross-sectional analysis, focusing on 318 children in Tehran, Iran, who had been newly diagnosed with ALL. All data were extracted from the patient case files that included additional information, such as clinical data, and demographic information. The Flow cytometry technique was employed to perform immunophenotyping for various markers. Moreover, the standardized protocol was carried out for conventional cytogenetic analysis. Out of 318, 179 (56.3%) and 139 (43.7%) were males and females, respectively. The most common subtype of ALL was Common B Cell ALL, accounting for 182 cases (57.23%), followed by Pre B cell ALL with 74 cases (23.27%) and T cell ALL with 27 cases (8.49%). Out of 222 patients, 17 (7.7%) had genetic abnormalities, with the highest incidence of abnormalities being associated with Runx 1 (four cases). Additionally, out of 228 patients, 143 (62.7%) were identified as having cytogenetic abnormalities, with the most prevalent abnormalities being hyperdiploidy (54 cases) and t (12;21) (28 cases). Our findings showed that some cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t (9;22) and hyperdiploidy, were consistent with previous studies. These results offer valuable foundational insights that can help direct future research on ALL patients and inform potential treatment strategies.",0
"Therapy-related B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a rare disease associated with poor cytogenetics and inferior survival outcomes. In this case series, we present two cases of B-ALL following treatment for invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, respectively, along with a third case of B-ALL arising in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia after treatment. The most common cytogenetic abnormalities observed in these patients were t(9;22) and monosomy 7. This case series underscores the importance of recognizing therapy-related B-ALL as a distinct clinical entity, which plays a crucial role in ALL risk classification and the long-term management of both solid and hematologic cancer survivors.",0
"The possible effects of different preparation methods (Italian or Mocha, Filter and Espresso) on the antioxidant activities of brewed coffee were assessed using two methods: Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and scavenging capacity (ABTS). In addition, the polyphenol content was estimated. The order of ferric reducing ability per gram of dry matter (dm) of the different brewed coffees tested, in terms of the coffee-making procedure used, was freeze-dried>filter≈espresso≈Italian. The order of ferric reducing ability per serving was filter>espresso>freeze-dried≈Italian. In the case of scavenging activity the order was similar to that described for the FRAP assay. There was a high correlation between the estimated polyphenol contents and the FRAP, or the ABTS values (r: 0.98, P<0.01; r: 0.99, P<0.01, respectively). In the case of FRAP and ABTS assays; a serving of filtered coffee was equivalent to 2653±297 and 1295±262 μg trolox, respectively. In the USA and Northern Europe, the pot containing the coffee is usually kept hot (85 °C) for several hours. We found that antioxidant activity increased significantly (by 34%) after four hours of heating. The cause of this increase would seem to be the formation of Maillard products, due to the heat process. These compounds also appear to be responsible for the fact that antioxidant capacity was higher in dark-roast than in other brewed coffees tested. Antioxidant activity decreased when milk was added to the espresso coffee.",1
"Tea is a complex mixture containing a range of compounds from simple phenolics to complex thearubigins, many of which have well-recognized antioxidant properties. This paper describes the application of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS(n)) methods for the rapid and routine analysis of more than 30 phenolics in tea. Green and black tea infusions were injected directly onto a reversed phase HPLC column, and the phenolics eluted using two different mobile phase gradients, one optimized to resolve catechin derivatives and the other, flavonols and theaflavins. Compounds, identified on the basis of their retention time, absorbance spectrum, and MS fragmentation pattern, included (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, theaflavin and their various gallate derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol mono-, di-, and triglycosides, quinic acid esters of gallic acid and hydroxycinnamates, and the purine alkaloids, caffeine and theobromine.",1
"The SMYD2 gene adjusts lysine residues on histones and non-histone proteins such as transcription factors, signaling kinases, and cell cycle regulators affecting the cell fate and other genes' expression. As it acts as an oncogene, SMYD2's expression levels may affect tumor progression. In this prospective study, our main aim was to determine the association of SMYD2 gene expression with the prognostic parameters of childhood B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and evaluate its influence on disease prognosis. SMYD2 gene expression was measured in the peripheral blood (PB) samples of 116 newly diagnosed B-ALL patients and 23 controls using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SMYD2 expression was significantly higher in the childhood B-ALL patients compared with the control group, p-value < 0.001. The patients with unfavorable rather than favorable structural chromosomal abnormalities had significantly higher SMYD2 mRNA levels, p < 0.001. SMYD2 expression levels were positively correlated with total leucocytes count (r = 0.206, p-value = 0.027) and peripheral blood blasts (r = 0.225, p-value = 0.015). There was a statistical difference between the B-ALL cases with high versus low SMYD2 levels regarding translocation (t12; 21), p-value = 0.015. Cox regression analysis identified the increased levels of SMYD2 as an independent prognostic factor affecting both OS and DFS. The SMYD2 gene plays a vital oncogenic role in childhood B-ALL. The association of high SMYD2 levels with unfavorable cytogenetics in childhood B-ALL may be helpful in understanding the relationship between structural chromosomal abnormalities and epigenetic dysregulation. High SMYD2 levels may be useful in the prediction of prognosis in childhood B-ALL.",0
"Physician characteristics such as education and sociodemographic attributes are associated with particular practice patterns, such as practice in rural settings. Understanding the Canadian context of such associations can inform medical school recruitment and health workforce decision-making. The objective of this scoping review was to report the nature and extent of the literature on associations between characteristics of physicians in Canada and physicians' practice patterns. Eligibility criteria: We included studies reporting associations between 1) the education or sociodemographic attributes of practicing physicians or residents in Canada and 2) practice patterns, including career choice, practice setting, and populations served. We searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE (R) ALL, Embase, ERIC, Education Source and Scopus) for quantitative primary studies and reviewed reference lists of included studies for additional studies. Data were extracted using a standardized data charting form. Our search yielded 80 studies. Sixty-two examined education, evenly divided between undergraduate and postgraduate. Fifty-eight examined physicians' attributes, most focusing on sex/gender. The majority of studies focused on the outcome of practice setting. We found no studies examining race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Many studies in our review found positive associations between (i) rural training or rural background and rural practice setting and (ii) location of training or physicians' origin and practice in that location, consistent with previous literature. Associations for sex/gender were mixed, suggesting it may be a less useful target for workforce planning or recruitment aiming to address gaps in health care provision. More research is needed on the association of characteristics, particularly race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, with career choice and populations served. Il existe un lien entre les caractéristiques des médecins, comme leur formation et leur profil sociodémographique, et des cadres de pratique particuliers, comme la pratique en milieu rural. La compréhension de ces liens dans le contexte canadien peut éclairer les stratégies d’admission dans les facultés de médecine et la planification de la main-d’œuvre dans le secteur de la santé. L’objectif de cette revue exploratoire était de faire état de la nature et de l’étendue de la littérature sur les liens entre les caractéristiques des médecins au Canada et leurs cadres de pratique. Critères de sélection : Nous avons inclus les études établissant des liens entre 1) la formation ou le profil sociodémographique des médecins ou des résidents en exercice au Canada et 2) les cadres de pratique, y compris le choix de carrière, le milieu de pratique et les populations desservies. Nous avons effectué des recherches dans cinq bases de données électroniques (MEDLINE (R) ALL, Embase, ERIC, Education Source et Scopus) pour trouver des études quantitatives primaires et avons examiné les listes de références bibliographiques des articles retenus pour repérer d’autres études. Les données ont été extraites à l’aide d’un formulaire normalisé. Notre recherche a permis de recenser 80 études. Soixante-deux d’entre elles portaient sur l’éducation, réparties de manière égale entre le premier cycle et le cycle de spécialisation. Cinquante-huit examinaient les caractéristiques des médecins, la plupart portant sur le sexe/genre. La majorité des études étaient focalisées sur le critère du milieu de pratique. Nous n’avons trouvé aucune étude portant sur la race/ethnicité ou le statut socio-économique. En accord avec des travaux antérieurs de nombreuses études de notre revue trouvent des associations positives entre (i) la formation en milieu rural ou l’origine rurale et un cadre de pratique rural et entre (ii) le lieu de formation ou l’origine du médecin et une pratique dans ce lieu. Les associations relatives au sexe/genre étaient mitigées, ce qui porte à croire qu’il s’agit peut-être d’une cible moins utile pour la planification ou le recrutement d’une main-d’œuvre visant à combler les lacunes dans la prestation des soins de santé. Des travaux supplémentaires sont nécessaires sur les liens entre le profil des médecins, en particulier la race/ethnie et le statut socio-économique, d’une part, et le choix de carrière et les populations desservies d’autre part.",0
"Refractory and relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric and young adult patients remains difficult to treat.

"Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare and indolent B-cell lymphoma. To investigate the type and survival of hematologic secondary malignancies (SMs) in Chinese patients with WM, we retrospectively reviewed the characteristics of 102 patients with WM from February 2002 to May 2023 in our center. Four men and two women were diagnosed with hematologic SMs. Of the six patients with hematologic SMs, one was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one with multiple myeloma (MM), one with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), one with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), and two with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The median age was 65.5 years (56-74 years). The median interval time between diagnosis of WM and hematologic SMs was 39.5 months (10-117 months). Among those with WM with hematologic SMs, five died and one survived. Overall survival (OS) was just 33 months (12-119 months) on median. A total of 32 patients died and 64 survived in the group of WM without hematologic SMs, and the median OS was 82 months (3-250 months). This is the first study in the Chinese population on hematologic SMs in WM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognosis of hematologic SMs in WM in the Chinese population, as well as to compare the population's characteristics to those of other centers. We investigated the underlying causes further and presented a research strategy for our forthcoming investigation. We intend to investigate risk factors for SMs as well as more accessible screening methods.",0
"Eriocitrin, a flavonoid glycoside present in lemon fruit, is metabolized in vivo to a series of eriodictyol, methylated eriodictyol, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, and their conjugates. Plasma antioxidant activity increased following oral administration of aqueous eriocitrin solutions to rats. Eriocitrin metabolites were found in plasma and renal excreted urine through HPLC and LC-MS analyses. Eriocitrin was not detected in plasma and urine, but eriodictyol, homoeriodictyol, and hesperetin in their conjugated forms were detected in plasma of 4.0 h following administration of eriocitrin. In urine for 24 h, both nonconjugates and conjugates of these metabolites were detected. 3,4-Dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid, which is metabolized from eriodictyol by intestinal bacteria, was detected in slight amounts with each form in 4.0-h plasma and 24-h urine. Eriocitrin was suggested to be metabolized by intestinal bacteria, and then eriodictyol and 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic of its metabolite were absorbed. Following administration of eriocitrin, plasma exhibited an elevated resistance effect to lipid peroxidation. Eriocitrin metabolites functioning as antioxidant agents are discussed.",1
"Cultivated highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and wild lowbush (Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) blueberries are excellent sources of phytochemicals that are believed to have significant biological activity. The objective of this study was to determine whether incorporation of blueberries into food products affects their phenolic content or antioxidant and antiproliferation activity. Several blueberry fruit-containing products including fresh, individually quick frozen (IQF), freeze-dried, spray-dried, heat-dried, cooked, juice concentrate, pie filling, and jam were fractionated to remove sugars and isolate groups of phytochemicals based on solubility. The fractions were analyzed for total phenolics and assayed for ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) antioxidant activity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, and hepa-1c1c7 antiproliferative activities. For both cultivated and wild berries, fresh and IQF berries had the highest total phenols, antioxidant activity, and antiproliferation activity. Whole freeze-dried wild blueberries also retained significant antiproliferative activity in 2 fractions eluted with acetone (fraction 4, 4% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL) and 50% aqueous acetone (fraction 5, 69% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL) and ranked close to the activities recorded for fresh (30% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL for fraction 5) and IQF whole fruit (27% of control cell growth at 20 (μg/mL for fraction 5). Products that were heat-processed retained most of the antioxidant activity and total phenolics found in unprocessed whole fruit. However, the heat-treated products lacked or had diminished antiproliferation activity, suggesting that although products may be high in phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, some forms of bioactivity may be compromised by harsh processing methods.",1
"The outcomes of adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain poor. Recent advancements in the field of leukemia research show potential for improved patient care. However, the adoption of research findings into clinical practice is fraught with practice- and country-specific challenges. The continued addition of new findings warrants critical evaluation for the feasibility of incorporation into clinical practice. A uniform set of evidence-based guidelines can favorably assist physicians in making optimal clinical decisions. Such a resource may also serve as a reference point for strategic planning of initiatives aimed at addressing critical barriers in the optimal management of B-cell ALL. This initiative was undertaken to seek a collaborative perspective and understand the existing challenges. Concordance-based recommendations were outlined through a systematic discussion on various aspects of treatment and management of adult B-cell ALL. The outcomes and experiences gained from this exercise will serve as a foundation for future efforts encompassing the more granular aspects of the management of B-cell ALL across the Asia-Pacific region.",0
"To validate the feasibility of intravoxel incoherent motion imaging (IVIM) for monitoring renal injury and uric acid-lowering efficacy in a rat model of hyperuricaemia. A total of 92 rats were analysed and categorized into 4 groups: control (CON), hyperuricaemia (HUA), allopurinol intervention (ALL), and combined intervention (COM). Eight rats were randomly selected from each group and underwent IVIM scanning on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Quantitative magnetic resonance values (D, D*, and f values) measured from the different renal anatomical regions. Quantitative histopathological analysis was performed to assess renal tubular injury using neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and renal fibrosis using alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (α-SMA). Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between IVIM-derived parameters and the expression of NGAL and α-SMA. The D values of the HUA, ALL, and COM groups generally showed a downward trend over time, and this fluctuation was most significant in the HUA group. The D values showed significant intergroup differences at each point, whereas only a few discrepancies were found in the D* and f values. In addition, the renal D value was negatively correlated with the positive staining rates for NGAL and α-SMA (P < .05), except for the lack of correlation between Dos and α-SMA (P > .05). IVIM could be a noninvasive and potential assessment modality for the evaluation of renal injury induced by hyperuricaemia and its prognostic efficacy. IVIM could be a surrogate manner in monitoring renal damage induced by hyperuricaemia and its treatment evaluation.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and young adults. Treatment is long and involves 2-3 years of a prolonged maintenance phase composed of oral chemotherapies. Adherence to these medications is critical to achieving good outcomes. However, adherence is difficult to determine, as there is currently no consensus on measures of adherence or criteria to determine nonadherence. Furthermore, there have been few studies in pediatric B-ALL describing factors associated with nonadherence. Thus, we performed a systematic review of literature on oral chemotherapy adherence during maintenance therapy in ALL following PRISMA guidelines. Published studies demonstrated various objective and subjective methods of assessing adherence without generalizable definitions of nonadherence. However, the results of these studies suggested that nonadherence to oral maintenance chemotherapy was associated with increased risk of relapse. Future studies of B-ALL therapy should utilize a uniform assessment of adherence and definitions of nonadherence to better determine the impact of nonadherence on B-ALL outcomes and identify predictors of nonadherence that could yield targets for adherence improving interventions.",0

"Four cultivars of red beetroot (Beta vulgaris) were evaluated with respect to their betalain and phenolic contents. The compounds were analysed using HPLC and identified by HPLC-DAD, HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques. Betalains (vulgaxanthins I and II, betanin and isobetanin) and phenolics [5,5',6,6'-tetrahydroxy-3,3'-biindolyl, feruloylglucose and β-D-fructofuranosyl-α-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside)] were determined in different parts of the root; betalains were analysed separately in the water extract and phenolics in the fractionated 80% aqueous methanol extract (betalain-free water fraction). In each cultivar, both betanin and isobetanin were found in greater amounts in the peel than in the flesh. A similar trend was not observed in the distribution of vulgaxanthins. The three studied phenolics appeared in all root parts of the beetroot cultivars with the flesh generally containing the least content. Additionally, two phenolic amides (N-trans-feruloyltyramine and N-trans-feruloylhomovanillylamine) and four flavonoids (betagarin, betavulgarin, cochliophilin A and dihydroisorhamnetin) were detected in the fractionated 80% aqueous methanol peel extracts (acetonitrile fraction) of beetroot.",1
"The fruit of all apple varieties tested possessed five quercetin glycosides, namely hyperin, isoquercitrin, reynoutrin, avicularin and quercitrin, as the major flavonol components. Total flavonol levels were in the range 26.4 to 73.9μg/g fresh wt (expressed as aglycone) with hyperin the dominant form in all varieties except Egremont and Jonagored, where quercitrin predominated, and the cider apples, where avicularin predominated. The proportion of flavonol in the peel ranged from 63.0 to 97.1% for the dessert and cooking apples and was not dependent on fruit size. Juice produced from the three varieties of cider apple contained 9.9 to 12.7% of the flavonols with the remainder retained in the pomace.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children, yet few environmental risk factors have been identified. We previously found an association between early-life tobacco smoke exposure and frequency of somatic deletions of 8 leukemia driver genes among childhood ALL patients in the California Childhood Leukemia Study. To expand analysis genome-wide and examine potential mechanisms, we conducted tumor whole-genome sequencing in 35 ALL patients, including 18 with high prenatal tobacco exposure and 17 with low exposure as determined by established epigenetic biomarkers. High tobacco exposure patients had significantly more structural variants (P < .001) and deletions (P = .001) genome-wide than low exposure patients. Investigation of off-target RAG recombination revealed that 41% of deletions in the high tobacco exposure patients were putatively RAG-mediated (full RAG motif identified at one or both breakpoints) compared with only 21% in the low exposure group (P = .001). In a multilevel model, deletions in high tobacco exposure patients were 2.44-fold (95% CI:1.13-5.38) more likely to be putatively RAG-mediated than deletions in low exposure patients. No point mutational signatures were associated with prenatal tobacco exposure. Our findings suggest that early-life tobacco smoke exposure may promote leukemogenesis by driving development of somatic deletions in pre-leukemic lymphocytes via off-target RAG recombination.",0
"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer among children worldwide. The availability of easily accessible multi-omics data provides unprecedented resources and opportunities for discovering and refining disease biology, cancer biomarkers, and drug mechanisms of action. This has led to exponential growth of omics data available in public repositories. However, delivering the useful information and knowledge extraction from this data is one of the bottlenecks of multi-omics. Presenting, navigating, and downloading ALL omics data in a user-friendly interface provide a valuable platform for biologists and clinicians to get most of the omics data. Our in-house data provides in-depth mass spectrometry-based protein abundance data for a large panel of commercially available ALL cell lines. Providing this data to the scientific community in the form of a user-friendly web-portal allows for easy and detailed exploration of the data. We have developed the Functional Omics Resource of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (FORALL) web-portal. FORALL is a shiny-based web portal designed to navigate in-depth mass spectrometry-based proteomics data of 51 cell lines. The proteomics data can be navigated and visualized along with matched RNA expression data as well as drug sensitivity data of 528 investigational and approved drugs. FORALL is available at https://proteomics.se/forall/.",0
"Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.",1
"Clingstone peaches contain a wide array of complex secondary plant metabolites and polyphenolics, and increasing evidence indicates that many of these components are important in human health. Oligomeric flavan-3-ol metabolites (procyanidins) are particularly interesting owing to their potent antioxidant activity and protective cardiovascular effects. To date, little information is available on how postharvest and processing conditions impact levels of phenolics and procyanidins in fruit. This research addresses the impact of lye peeling, freezing, storage temperature (4 and 30 °C) and three different time–temperature sterilisation combinations on levels of total phenolics (TPs) in Ross clingstone peaches. Additionally, we describe the profile of procyanidin oligomers (monomers through heptamers) in clingstone and freestone peaches and demonstrate a dramatic decrease in procyanidins in thermally processed peaches. TP levels ranged between 316 and 397 mg kg−1 in peeled peaches and between 376 and 609 mg kg−1 in unpeeled peaches. Cold storage at 4 °C for 14 days or freezing and storing at −12 °C for 3 months produced no loss in TPs. Peaches stored at 30 °C for 24 h resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in TPs. Studies of TPs in peaches processed at temperatures of 213 °F for 40 min, 220 °F for 10 min and 230 °F for 2.4 min indicate that processing above 213 °F decreases levels of both TPs (up to 21%) and procyanidins (up to 100%). Processing at 213 °F for 40 min produced no significant loss in TPs. Furthermore, studies reveal that a 30–43% loss in phenolic levels occurs during the first 3 months in storage after canning. It is clear that both storage and thermal processing conditions profoundly impact the levels of polyphenolics in peaches. More interestingly, these studies indicate that peaches are a rich source of procyanidins, having profiles similar to those found in cocoa, apples, wine and tea.",1
"In 2022, leukemia ranked as the second most common hematological malignancy after non-Hodgkin lymphoma worldwide. However, updated global estimates of leukemia incidence by subtype are unavailable. We estimated leukemia incidences for different leukemia subtypes by country, world region, and human developmental index using data from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents databases combined with the GLOBOCAN 2022 estimates of leukemia in 185 countries. We estimated sex-specific age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100 000 for children (0-19 years) and adults (20+ years). In adults, the most common leukemia worldwide was AML (males: 38%, ASR = 3·1; females: 43%, ASR = 2·4), followed by CLL (males: 28%, ASR = 2·2; females: 24%, ASR = 1·3). In very high HDI countries, the ASR of CLL was higher than the ASR of AML among males (5·2 versus 4·3, respectively) and similar among females (2·9 and 3·0, respectively). In children, the most common leukemia was ALL (boys: 70%, ASR = 2·4; girls: 68%, ASR = 1·8) followed by AML (boys: 22%, ASR = 0·76; girls: 25%, ASR = 0·65). ALL proportions varied across world sub-regions from 57 to 78% among boys, and from 49 to 80% among girls. Our findings suggest clear geographical patterns of leukemia subtypes in adults and children. Further research into underlying causes that explain these variations is needed to support cancer control strategies for prevention and plan national healthcare needs.",0
"In the 2022, WHO and ICC classifications, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia (M/LN-eo) and tyrosine kinase gene fusions represent rare hematologic malignancies driven by rearrangements of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, JAK2, FLT3, and ETV6::ABL1 fusion. Eosinophilia is the most constant finding, whereas the clinicopathological features are quite heterogeneous, presenting as Chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) NOS, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN), MDS, MPN, systemic mastocytosis (SM), T or B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL/LBL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), blastic phase of MPN, or mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). Extramedullary involvement at diagnosis or during progression is common. Here, we report a very unusual case of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with ETV6::FLT3 fusion with a nodal presentation without associated eosinophilia. Our case draws attention to diagnostic pitfalls in these rare entities.",0
"This meta-analysis assesses the efficacy of TCRαβ+/CD19+ depleted hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in pediatric patients with hematological malignancies, bridging the gap in the heterogeneous results of published studies. We analyzed post-HSCT complications and survival outcomes in 1068 children across 14 studies, using both aggregated and patient-level data from acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) studies, employing the IPDfromKM technique for time-to-event data reconstruction. The analysis reveals a 95 % engraftment success rate (95 % CI: 93-97) and 6-year overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 67.2 % and 66.3 %, respectively, with no significant differences in DFS between haploidentical and unrelated donors (hazard ratio = 0.9, 95 % CI: 0.53-1.55). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) grades III-IV and chronic GvHD incidences were 8 % (95 % CI: 6-11) and 17 % (95 % CI: 10-27). The relapse rate was 27 % (95 % CI: 21-33), with relapse-related mortality at 21 % (95 % CI: 15-28) and HSCT-related mortality at 12 % (95 % CI: 7-19). Relapse was significantly lower in patients (mostly ALL) receiving total body irradiation (risk ratio = 0.53, P = 0.04). These findings underscore TCRαβ/CD19-depleted HSCT as a valuable option for patients without HLA-matched donors, highlighting the need for larger, multicenter studies.",0
"The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.",1
"The antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices was evaluated by four different methods (ABTS, DPPH, DMPD, and FRAP) and compared to those of red wine and a green tea infusion. Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity (18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.",1
"The contents of flavonoids in onions, green beans, and peas have been analysed in relation to the effect of different heat treatments. Two major flavonoids were studied, quercetin and kaempferol. The identification and quantification of the flavonoids were performed with high performance liquid chromatography and UV detection. The greatest loss of flavonoids in onion took place during the pre-processing step where the onion was peeled, trimmed, and chopped before blanching. Blanched onion contained 25 mg quercetin and 0.35 mg kaempferol per 100 g edible part. Blanched green beans contained 1.3 mg quercetin and 0.24 mg kaempferol per 100 g, and blanched peas only 0.15 mg quercetin per 100 g. No kaempferol was detected in peas. Further cooking, frying or warm-holding for up to 2 h of the blanched vegetables, did not influence the flavonoid content. Onions in ready-made dishes and home-cooked food as well as green beans may be good dietary sources of flavonoids.",1
"The PICALM::MLLT10 fusion is a rare but recurrent cytogenetic abnormality in acute leukemia, with limited clinicopathologic and outcome data available. Herein, we analyzed 156 acute leukemia patients with PICALM::MLLT10 fusion, including 12 patients from our institutions and 144 patients from the literature. The PICALM::MLLT10 fusion preferentially manifested in pediatric and young adult patients, with a median age of 24 years. T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) constituted 65% of cases, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 27%, and acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) 8%. About half of T-ALL were classified as an early T-precursor (ETP)-ALL. In our institutions' cohort, mediastinum was the most common extramedullary site of involvement. Eight of 12 patients were diagnosed with T-ALL exhibiting a pro-/pre-T stage phenotype (CD4/CD8-double negative, CD7-positive), and frequent CD79a expression. NGS revealed pathogenic mutations in 5 of 6 tested cases, including NOTCH1, and genes in RAS and JAK-STAT pathways and epigenetic modifiers. Of 138 cases with follow-up, pediatric patients (<18 years) had 5-year overall survival (OS) of 71%, significantly better than adults at 33%. The 5-year OS for AML patients was 25%, notably shorter than T-ALL patients at 54%; this distinction was observed in both pediatric and adult populations. Furthermore, adult but not pediatric ETP-ALL patients demonstrated inferior survival compared to non-ETP-ALL patients. Neither karyotype complexity nor transplant status had a discernible impact on OS. In conclusion, PICALM::MLLT10 fusion is most commonly seen in T-ALL patients, particularly those with an ETP phenotype. AML and adult ETP-ALL patients had adverse prognosis. PICALM::MLTT10 fusion testing should be considered in T-ALL, AML, and ALAL patients.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children worldwide. Although ALL patients' overall survival rates in wealthy countries currently surpass 80%, 15-20% of patients still experience relapse. The underlying mechanisms of relapse are still not fully understood, and little progress has been made in treating refractory or relapsed disease. Disease relapse and treatment failure are common causes of leukemia-related death. In ALL relapse, several gene signatures have been identified, but it is also important to study miRNAs involved in ALL relapse in an effort to avoid relapse and to achieve better survival rates since miRNAs regulate target genes that participate in signaling pathways involved in relapse, such as those related to drug resistance, survival signals, and antiapoptotic mechanisms. Several miRNAs, such as miR-24, miR-27a, miR-99/100, miR-124, miR-1225b, miR-128b, miR-142-3p, miR-155 and miR-335-3p, are valuable biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response in ALL patients. Thus, this review aimed to analyze the primary miRNAs involved in pediatric ALL relapse and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms in an effort to identify miRNAs that may be potential candidates for anti-ALL therapy soon.",0
"The simultaneous determination of catechins, gallic acid, and three methylxanthine compounds was determined in chocolate extract by reversed-phase HPLC. An isocratic HPLC procedure using Hypersil-ODS column with methanol three distilled water–formic acid (48.75:200.5:0.75, v/v/v) as a mobile phase was used and the HPLC profiles of 11 chocolate products were obtained. (–)- Epicatechin, (–)-epigallocatechin gallate, levels were very high whereas (+)-catechin, (–)-epigallocatechin and (–)-epicatechin gallate were lower values. Gallic acid was predominant compounds with extremely high levels in all chocolate samples. The content of three methylxanthine, theobromine, theophylline and caffeine was quantified with this procedure. Caffein amounts were low in all samples, while theobromine levels were high in milk and dark chocolates. Theophylline was at trace levels in some chocolates and could not be detected in some samples. This method was reliable, reproducible and objective for quantitative identification of flavanols and alkaloid compounds in the chocolate industry.",1
"The quality of dry roasted peanuts is highly dependent on storage conditions for preventing oxidation of fatty acids; however, changes in polyphenolics affecting antioxidant capacity due to co-oxidative reactions are unknown. The objective of this work was to evaluate oxidative stability of polyphenolics in peanut kernels with naturally varying rates of lipid oxidation. Three peanut varieties containing varying levels of oleic acid (normal, mid, and high) were dry roasted and evaluated for phytochemical changes over four months of storage at 20 and 35 °C; analyses included peroxide value, total and individual phenolics and antioxidant capacity. The normal oleic acid peanuts suffered up to 2.6-fold and mid-oleic acid peanuts 2-fold more lipid oxidation than the high-oleic acid peanuts stored at 35 °C. Changes in total soluble phenolics were initially similar among cultivars, but antioxidant capacity was found to decrease by 62%, on average, during storage at 35 °C, independently of rates of lipid oxidation. Free p-coumaric acid, three esterified derivatives of p-coumaric, and two esterified derivatives of hydroxybenzoic acid were the predominant polyphenolics present and their rates of change were similar among cultivars and independent of storage time or temperature. The high-oleic acid content was essential for prevention of lipid oxidation, but data indicated that co-oxidative reactions, affecting polyphenolic content during storage, were not great enough to significantly alter antioxidant capacity.",1

"The ABO system is an essential blood group in clinical transfusion medicine implicated in several human diseases. The ABO system has been investigated for over a century, with various studies exploring potential links to disease susceptibility. The study examines the possible relationship between leukemia and the distribution and the ABO blood group system discrepancy. A comprehensive review was conducted on the recommended databases to review the ABO blood groups, their association with leukemia, and the expected changes in blood groups among leukemia patients. The study highlights different kinds of leukemia, such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), their characteristics, and their relationship with ABO blood groups. The document concludes that studying ABO blood group distributions among leukemia patients showed that the most common blood group in acute leukemia is the A group, while in chronic leukemia, the O group is predominant; more studies are required. This study also confirmed an association between leukemia and ABO blood group discrepancy.",0
"The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 +/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to the food matrix as a key factor.",1
"Chocolate and other cocoa-containing products are a rich source of polyphenols. This paper describes an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method that can separate and quantify in 3 min six of the major chocolate polyphenols: catechin; epicatechin; B2 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); B5 (epicatechin-4beta-6-epicatechin); C1 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); and tetramer D (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin). A survey of 68 chocolate samples indicated that there was a strongly predictive relationship between epicatechin and the other individual polyphenols, especially procyanidin B2 (R 2 = 0.989), even though the chocolates came from varied sources and manufacturers. The relationship was less strong with catechin, and so further work to explore the reasons for this difference was performed. Chiral analysis on a subset of 23 chocolates showed that (-)-epicatechin had a predictive relationship with (+)-catechin in line with the other polyphenols, but not with (-)-catechin (the predominant form). This indicates that (-)-catechin is the most affected by manufacturing conditions, possibly formed through epimerization from (-)-epicatechin during processing. The results show that epicatechin concentrations can be used to predict the content of other polyphenols, especially B2 and C1, and total polyphenols content. Finally, the (-)-catechin content is not predictable from the epicatechin content, and it is concluded that this is the main form of polyphenol that varies according to manufacturing conditions and cocoa origin.",1
"Aim: The authors evaluated the effectiveness of treatment with recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa and concentrate of all prothrombin complex factors in patients with massive postoperative bleeding that could not be controlled with traditional therapy. Materials and Methods: In the period from 2020 to 2021, recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa was administered to 18 patients after cardiac surgery (group I), while the concentrate of all prothrombin complex factors was administered to 16 patients postoperatively (group II). During this period, 647 patients were operated on. The patients had normal coagulation screening tests (APTT, INR, TT, fibrinogen level, and PLT level) before surgery. Mean blood loss before and after administration of eptacog alfa and the total prothrombin complex concentrate was assessed. The mean dose of eptacog alfa was 30.95 mcg/kg b.w., and the total prothrombin complex factor concentrate dose was 14.17 mcg/kg b.w. After transfusion with red blood cell concentrate, fresh frozen plasma, and platelet concentrate, in the absence of improvement in the dynamics of postoperative drainage, it was decided to include recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa or a concentrate of all prothrombin complex factors in the treatment. Results: After administration of recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa at a dose of 30.95 mcg/kg b.w., bleeding stopped in 12 patients, but the remaining 6 patients required reoperation due to persistently high drainage. The decision to perform a rethoracotomy was made by a team of cardiothoracic surgeons and anesthesiologists, taking into account the dynamics of drainage (bleeding) and the hemodynamic stability of the patient. After the administration of concentrate of all prothrombin complex factors at a dose of 14.17 U/kg b.w., bleeding stopped in 12 patients. Four patients required reoperation due to persistent bleeding. Conclusions: Treatment with recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa and concentrate of all prothrombin complex factors is effective and safe for cardiac surgery patients.",0
"Soybeans and soy products are the main source of isoflavones. Several methods and different kinds of soybeans have been published to quantify soy isoflavones, but the amount of isoflavones was variable each other. In order to investigate the contents of isoflavone with pure and processed soybean (the name of soybean is Dae du soybean) from different area (Korea and China), some isoflavones (7-o-glucosides, acetyl daidzin, malonyl genistin and aglycones) from Korean soybean, Chinese soybean and their processed products of soybeans were extracted by 60% EtOH, and analyzed using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The malonyl genistin was found the most content in soybean, but it was very small in chungkukjang. For the aglycones, glycitein was extracted more than daidzein from chungkukjang, contrary to the trend in pure soybean. The small amounts of isoflavones were extracted from doenjang, and the main isoflavone was daidzein.",1
"Adolescents and young adults (AYAs; ages 15-39 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have worse outcomes than pediatric patients with ALL. Multiple factors contribute to this differential survival. AYAs are more likely to have higher-risk leukemia biology than children with ALL. AYA patients have more choices for treatment facility and treatment protocol, as well as barriers to clinical trial enrollment, both of which can affect survival. AYAs must also navigate psychosocial factors inherent to their unique developmental stage. Furthermore, AYAs typically sustain more treatment-related toxicities than pediatric patients. Treatment on pediatric or pediatric-inspired ALL protocols at pediatric cancer centers has been associated with improved outcomes for AYAs with ALL, but there is still variation in the treatment that AYAs with ALL receive. Clinical trials focused on AYAs with ALL and individualized decision-making regarding choice of treatment facility and treatment protocol are needed to optimize the survival and long-term outcomes of this patient population.",0
"HiC sequencing is a DNA-based next-generation sequencing method that preserves the 3D conformation of the genome and has shown promise in detecting genomic rearrangements in translational research studies. To evaluate HiC as a potential clinical diagnostic platform, analytical concordance with routine laboratory testing was assessed using primary pediatric leukemia and sarcoma specimens previously positive for clinically significant genomic rearrangements. Archived specimen types tested included viable and nonviable frozen leukemic cells, as well as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues. Initially, pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (A-RMS) specimens with known genomic rearrangements were subjected to HiC analysis to assess analytical concordance. Subsequently, a discovery cohort consisting of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases with no known genomic rearrangements based on prior clinical diagnostic testing were evaluated to determine whether HiC could detect rearrangements. Using a standard sequencing depth of 50 million raw read-pairs per sample, or approximately 5X raw genomic coverage, 100% concordance was observed between HiC and previous clinical cytogenetic and molecular testing. In the discovery cohort, a clinically relevant gene fusion was detected in 45% of leukemia cases (5/11). This study demonstrates the value of HiC sequencing to medical diagnostic testing as it identified several clinically significant rearrangements, including those that might have been missed by current clinical testing workflows. HiC sequencing is a DNA-based next-generation sequencing method that preserves the 3D conformation of the genome, facilitating detection of genomic rearrangements.HiC was 100% concordant with clinical diagnostic testing workflows for detecting clinically significant genomic rearrangements in pediatric leukemia and rhabdomyosarcoma specimens.HiC detected clinically significant genomic rearrangements not previously detected by prior clinical cytogenetic and molecular testing.HiC performed well with archived non-viable and viable frozen leukemic cell samples, as well as archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens.",0
"Proanthocyanidin-free mutant (ant) and parent (normal) barley pairs were grown at the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station, Bozeman, Montana, U.S.A., in 1985 and 1986. The pairs included: Triumph, ant17-148 (cv. Gallant); Moravian III, ant13-605; Andre, ant13-587; Robust, ant 17-625; Advance, ant17-537, normal and ant-, respectively. The ant barleys contained more (P < 0·04) protein than the normal barleys (14·5 vs. 14·1%, respectively), and the 1985 crop had a higher (P < 0·04) protein level than the 1986 crop (14·6 vs. 14·0%, respectively). The starch and mineral contents were similar for all barleys. The fiber contents were similar for type and crop year, but variation (P < 0·04) existed among pairs. Differences (P < 0·04) appeared in ether extract and viscosity values with barley type, crop year and among pairs. The total β-glucan contents were similar within barley pairs, but total β-glucan contents among pairs differed (P < 0·02), and the 1986 barleys contained more (P < 0·002) total β-glucans than the 1985 crop. Normal barleys contained more (P < 0·0001) proanthocyanidins and total phenols than the ant barleys, but tannin contents did not differ between barley types or among pairs. Physical measurements were similar between barley pairs, but the normal barleys had heavier (P < 0·05) 1000-kernel weights than the ant barleys and the 1985 crop had heavier (P < 0·002) test weights than the 1986 crop. The proanthocyanidin-free trait had relatively little impact on most other chemical and physical traits of barley. The data presented in this study suggest that, if the ant gene becomes a desirable genetic trait in barley, the chemical components will not be altered so as to reduce the value of the grain for feed significantly.",1
"The antioxidant activity of phenolics in fruits of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum cv. Sierra), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Ben Lear), wild chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea cv. Amberland) was determined in this study. The phenolic constituents and contents among the different berries varied considerably. Anthocyanins were found to be the main components in all these berries. Chlorogenic acid in blueberry, quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.",1
"The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.",1
"Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective effects of GSE.",1
"TAM-family tyrosine kinases (TYRO3, AXL and MERTK) are potential cancer therapeutic targets. In previous studies MERTK inhibition in the immune microenvironment was therapeutically effective in a B-cell acute leukemia (B-ALL) model. Here, we probed anti-leukemia immune mechanisms and evaluated roles for TYRO3 and AXL in the leukemia microenvironment. Host Mertk knock-out or MERTK inhibitor MRX-2843 increased CD8α",0
"The odds of survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has increased markedly owing to a better understanding of pathogenesis, adoption of risk stratification therapy, and availability of newer therapeutic agents. These drugs, however, may affect balance and functional mobility, leading to activity restrictions. Virtual reality (VR) is a promising rehabilitation program for motor difficulties. The study, therefore, aimed to determine the effect of a smartphone-based VR intervention on balance and functional mobility in children with ALL. The pre-post experimental study included 32 children with ALL between 4 and 18 years of age. They received smartphone-based VR intervention every day for a period of 2 weeks, with each session lasting for 30 minutes. Each session included five VR games that were played by the child for 5 minutes each, with 1 minute rest between the games. Pre- and post-intervention, balance and functional mobility were evaluated using the balance subset of Bruininks Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, second edition (BOT-2) and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, respectively. Children with ALL demonstrated a significant improvement in balance post-intervention, with a mean difference of 2.22 ± 1.75 ( P < 0.0001). Functional mobility improved with a mean difference of 1.12 ± 1.09 ( P < 0.0001). There was an improvement of 8.04% and 11.04% in balance and functional mobility, respectively. The study concluded that a 2-week smartphone-based VR intervention is effective in improving balance and functional mobility in children with ALL.",0
"A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection method separating 16 phenolic acids was achieved. Six columns and several mobile phases were investigated. Resolution was achieved with a high-purity silica Phenomenex Luna C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) and a binary gradient consisting of CH3OH-water (with 0.1% formic acid) and flow rate set at 0.7 ml/min. Acids were detected and quantitation performed at wavelength representing the lowest energy lambda(max) for individual acids. Extraction procedure from wine was optimized and yields ranged from 79 to 87% based on internal standard recovery. To confirm our quantitative results, identical samples were analyzed both in-house and by a collaborating laboratory. Correlation of two data sets generated linear regression equations that approached unity (0.93-0.98) and R2 values ranging from 0.990 to 0.999.",1
"Polyphenolic phytochemical extractions of six cultivars of plums (Beltsville Elite B70197, Cacak Best, French Damson, Long John, Stanley, Yugoslavian Elite T101) and Gala apples were performed using 80% aqueous methanol with ultrasound assistance and extracts were analyzed for total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity. The total phenolic contents of various cultivars of plums were in a range of 174 to 375 mg/100 g, expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE), on a fresh weight basis. Total flavonoid concentrations ranged from 118 to 237 mg catechin equivalents (CE)/100 g fresh weight. The concentrations of total phenolics and flavonoids in Gala apples were 118±1.4 mg GAE and 62.0±6.9 mg CE per 100 g fresh sample weight, respectively. The stable radical chromogen, ABTS•−, commonly employed for the antioxidant activity measurement, was used to evaluate antioxidant capacity of plums and apples. The total antioxidant capacities, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), of fresh plums ranged from 266 to 559 mg/100 g. The order of total antioxidant capacity among different plum cultivars was as follows: Beltsville Elite B70197>Cacak Best⩾French Damson>Yugoslavian Elite T101>Long John>Stanley. The total antioxidant capacity of fresh Gala apple was 205±5.6 mg VCEAC/100 g. There was a good correlation between total phenolics or flavonoids contents and VCEAC at the high level of P<0.001. Dietary polyphenolics from plums may supply substantial antioxidants, which may provide health-promoting advantages to the consumer.",1
"This work was carried out on the study of virgin olive oil from two olive descendants obtained through controlled crossings on Chemlali, the dominant Tunisian olive oil variety. These crossings on Chemlali were undertaken to improve its oil quality. Preliminary work evaluating the oil fatty acid composition of the oil of 40 descendants showed the performance of two cultivars among the studied hybrids. These two new cultivars (Hd 034 and Hd 039) have an improved oil composition compared to that of Chemlali. A further study was therefore required for their complete characterization. The analytical parameters (fatty acid composition, total phenolic compounds, chlorophylls and carotenoids contents, oxidative stability, free acidity, peroxide value and ultraviolet characteristics) showed significant differences between oils from both cultivars.

"The negative impact of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is well known whereas its clinical relevance in acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is still unclear. We have carried out a prospective multicentric observational study within the Rete Ematologica Lombarda to describe the incidence of IPA in acute leukemia (AL) patients, focusing on differences between AML and ALL. Between 2018 and 2020, 207 AL patients (AML: 165, ALL: 42) were evaluated. During induction, proven/probable and possible IPA were diagnosed in 32/207 patients (15.4%), equally divided into proven/probable and possible (16 each, 7.7%). IPA diagnosis was made in 23/165 (13.9%) AML and in 9/42 (21.4%) ALL patients (p = 0.2374). Proven/probable IPA were more frequent in ALL than in AML (ALL: 7/42, 16.6% vs. AML: 9/165, 5.4%; p = 0.0235). OS was similar in patients with or without proven/probable IPA (not reached vs. 63 months, p = 0.588), while OS was significantly reduced in possible IPA (22 months vs. not reached, p = 0.0167). More than 15 days of neutropenia duration and lack of antimold prophylaxis were associated with IPA. Achieving complete remission was protective, whereas age over 60 years and, with a borderline significance, possible IPA were associated with risk of death. In conclusion, Ph-negative ALL should be considered at the same high risk for IPA as AML. Antimold prophylaxis should be probably extended also to ALL.",0
"Major brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were analyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and flavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), quercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the manufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, (-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into (-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of cocoa powder products.",1
"Primary refractory or relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and mixed phenotype myeloid/T-cell acute leukemia have dismal prognoses. New treatment approaches, preferably targeting specific leukemic aberrations to overcome resistance, are urgently needed. The bright expression of the CD38 antigen found in several cases of T-ALL led to an investigation into the role of anti-CD38 antibodies in the treatment of T-ALL. Here, we present three cases of resistant and relapsed T-ALL and myeloid/T-cell treated with daratumumab-based therapy, including venetoclax and bortezomib (Dara-Ven-Bor). All patients achieved complete remission, with minimal residual disease negativity within four weeks of treatment, allowing them to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. The toxicity of the triple schema was acceptable. Our patients and other cases reviewed here suggest that daratumumab combined with venetoclax and bortezomib may be a very effective and relatively safe salvage treatment, even in primary resistant T-ALL.",0
"Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor (ROR)1 is overexpressed in some hematological cancers but has low expression in normal tissues, making it a potential therapeutic target. We investigated this therapeutic potential in childhood B-cell precursor (BCP) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases. The proportion of ROR1+ cells was significantly higher in T-ALL (median, 13.8%; range, 2.9%-87%) than BCP-ALL (6%, 0.3%-83%, P = .02). Antigen density was also lower in BCP-ALL (median, 1027; range, 876-2588) compared to T-ALL (1089, 865-1527). In leukemia propagating cells (LPCs), ROR1 levels were highest in CD34-/CD19+ and CD34-/CD7+ subpopulations. Notably, ROR1+ LPC, in both BCP-ALL and T-ALL, survived induction therapy and their numbers increased post treatment. Subsequently, ROR1 bispecific T-cell engagers (Teng) were tested on primary cases in vitro and in vivo. Addition of ROR1 Teng in vitro reduced ALL survival to 44% in BCP-ALL and 58% in T-ALL, compared to T cells alone (94% and 84%, respectively; P ≤ .01). When NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rγtm1Wjl/SzJ mice engrafted with primary leukemia were treated with ROR1 Teng, disease burden was reduced by up to 520-fold (from 15.6% to 0.03%) in ROR1+ cells and 68-fold (58% to 0.9%) in CD19+ cells in BCP-ALL. In T-ALL cases, there was a fourfold reduction (from 1.2% to 0.3%) in ROR1+ and 2.3-fold (from 83.7% to 36.7%) in CD7+ levels. This resistance of ROR1+ cells to current therapies makes it an important target. Moreover, as ROR1 Teng were at least comparable to CD19 Teng in vivo, they could be considered for the treatment of refractory BCP-ALL.",0
"A study was conducted to determine the presence of resveratrol, pterostilbene, and piceatannol in Vaccinium berries. Samples representing selections and cultivars of 10 species from Mississippi, North Carolina, Oregon, and Canada were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Resveratrol was found in Vaccinium angustifolium (lowbush blueberry), Vaccinium arboretum (sparkleberry), Vaccinium ashei (rabbiteye blueberry), Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush blueberry), Vaccinium elliottii (Elliott's blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry), Vaccinium myrtillus (bilberry), Vaccinium stamineum (deerberry), Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. vitis-ideae (lingonberry), and Vaccinium vitis-ideae var. minor (partridgeberry) at levels between 7 and 5884 ng/g dry sample. Lingonberry was found to have the highest content, 5884 ng/g dry sample, comparable to that found in grapes, 6471 ng/g dry sample. Pterostilbene was found in two cultivars of V. ashei and in V. stamineum at levels of 99-520 ng/g dry sample. Piceatannol was found in V. corymbosum and V. stamineum at levels of 138-422 ng/g dry sample. These naturally occurring stilbenes, known to be strong antioxidants and to have cancer chemopreventive activities, will add to the purported health benefits derived from the consumption of these small fruits.",1
"T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have common and distinguishing clinical and molecular features. Molecular prognostic factors are needed for T-LBL. We assessed the prevalence and prognostic impact of the T-cell receptor β (TRB)::NOTCH1 fusion in 192 pediatric patients with T-LBL and 167 pediatric patients with T-ALL, using novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction and genomic capture high-throughput sequencing techniques. The fusion was detected in 12 patients with T-LBL (6.3%) but in none of the patients with T-ALL (P = .0006, Fisher exact test). In T-LBL, the TRB::NOTCH1 fusion was associated with a significantly higher incidence of relapse (67% vs 17% in gene fusion-negative patients, P < .001, Fisher exact test). The breakpoint in TRB was most frequently located in J2-7 (n = 6). In NOTCH1, the breakpoints varied between exon 24 and 27. Consequently, a truncated NOTCH1 with its dimerization, regulation, and signal transduction domains gets controlled by strong TRB enhancer elements. This study reveals a novel recurrent genetic variant with significant prognostic relevance in T-LBL, which was absent in T-ALL. The TRB::NOTCH1 fusion in T-LBL suggests a possible unique pathogenic mechanism divergent from T-ALL. Further studies will validate the role of the TRB::NOTCH1 fusion as prognostic marker in T-LBL and elucidate its pathogenic mechanisms.",0
"Consumers demand healthy, natural and fresh foods, which require only a minimum amount of effort and time for preparation. This was the reason for comparing the effects of different mild preservation technologies on onion flavonoids. Onions were minimally processed to produce fresh-sliced onions, which were packed either in closed plastic cups or under vacuum conditions, taking into account the effect of light exposure. In all cases, the commodity was acceptable after the storage period, with the exception of vacuum packaging (score 5, fair/poor, on a 1–9 scale), due to water loss (about 4%) colour loss and a glassy appearance. In general, after storage in the dark, a slight increase in flavonols was observed, whereas a clear decrease in the relatively low amounts of anthocyanins was evident. However, the best performance was obtained when the more transparent polystyrene cups were stored under light. Both types of flavonoids increased, with an enhanced increase of total flavonols by 58%, and an increase in total anthocyanins of 39%.",1
"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is typically characterized by the presence of coagulopathy and the A Transcriptome analysis of six patients was performed by RNA-seq. The heat map was used for showing the RNA expression profile, the volcano plot for identifying differential expression genes (DEGs), and the KEGG Orthology-Based Annotation System (KOBAS) online biological information database for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Obvious differences between APL with A",0
"Determination of free phenolic compounds in potato samples was optimized using a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with on-line diode array detection. This method was applied to samples of four cultivars of potatoes harvested in Tenerife (Canary Islands). The free phenolic compounds found in the potato samples were (+)-catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid. Potato samples belonging to Colorada cultivar, ssp. andigena, had mean concentrations of total phenolic compounds and chlorogenic acid higher than those found for Kerr's Pink and Cara cultivars, ssp. tuberosum, and for Negra cultivar, S. x chaucha. In contrast, p-coumaric acid was not detected in any potato samples of the Colorada cultivar. Traditional potatoes presented a higher mean concentration of ferulic acid than recently imported potatoes. A significant and negative correlation was established between (+)-catechin and p-coumaric acid. A considerable contribution to the daily intake of flavonoids was observed with the actual consumption of potatoes.",1
"Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones and their hydroxylated analogues 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, 8-OH-daidzein, and 3'-OH-genistein and (2) to characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.",1
"Five white and seven red varieties of onion were analysed for dry matter, carbohydrates, total phenols, coloring matter, lachrymatory factor and pyruvic acid content. Percent dry matter varied from 10.66 to 14.80. Total water soluble sugars, reducing sugars and total phenols ranged from 41.50 to 74.00, 12.00 to 22.25, and 1.75 to 2.95 percent (on a dry wt basis), respectively. The lachrymatory factor and pyruvic acid content ranged from 8.00 to 27.25 mg/100g and 6.18 to 13.27 micro moles/g respectively on a fresh wt basis. Red varieties contained a higher phenolic content than white ones. Varieties with higher phenolic content also had a greater amount of coloring matter in the dehydrated onions. The variety Punjab-48 was considered to be most suitable for dehydration purposes.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, in which cytotoxic T cells are engineered to directly recognize tumor antigens, has been shown to be highly effective in the treatment of blood cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, its application to solid tumors has not been as successful. Investigations have identified several barriers to the efficacy of CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumors; these include difficulties in target antigen selection, a physical barrier to CAR-T cell infiltration, and an immune-inhibitory environment in tumor tissue. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the problems underlying CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors and potential countermeasures.",0
"Despite improvements in survival among pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), survival outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with ALL have lagged. The reasons for the inferior outcomes among AYAs are multifactorial, each presenting unique challenges and requiring novel solutions. First, adverse disease biology is more common among AYAs with ALL. Ongoing trials are investigating novel approaches to treatment, such as incorporating JAK inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL, menin inhibitors for KMT2A-rearranged ALL, and BCL2/BCLXL inhibition for T-cell ALL. Poorer adherence to therapy also impedes improvements in survival outcomes for AYAs with ALL, but early data suggest that technology, both for monitoring and interventions, may be useful in increasing adherence among this population. Finally, better access to clinical trials and collaboration between pediatric and adult centers is critical in advancing the care of AYAs with ALL. Significant improvements have been made over the past decade, but recognizing, understanding, and addressing each of these unique challenges provides hope that the outcomes for AYAs will continue to improve even further.",0
"The aim of this study was to compare the value of Senga Sengana, a long-term standard cultivar, with other cultivars grown in northwest Poland, namely Dukat, Elkat, Selva, Elsanta and Kent. The fruits were obtained from a commercial plantation and cultivated by applying conventional farming practice. Among the strawberry cultivars studied Elsanta berries had the highest vitamin C content and its leaves the highest ellagic acid content. Kent berries had the highest contents of total sugar, total polyphenol, total anthocyanin and ellagic acid derivatives. Dukat berries had the highest dry weight and soluble solids content. Senga Sengana berries had a slightly higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging effect than other cultivars. Consumer-objective colour measurements were performed to evaluate the quality of the fruit. Elsanta and Elkat berries were found to have the highest L (lightness), a * (redness), C * (chromaticity) and h (hue angle) values.",1
"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T‑ALL), a neoplasm derived from T cell lineage‑committed lymphoblasts, is characterized by genetic alterations that result in activation of oncogenic transcription factors and the NOTCH1 pathway activation. The NOTCH is a transmembrane receptor protein activated by γ‑secretase. γ‑secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are a NOTCH‑targeted therapy for T‑ALL. However, their clinical application has not been successful due to adverse events (primarily gastrointestinal toxicity), limited efficacy, and drug resistance caused by several mechanisms, including activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway. Nelfinavir is an human immunodeficiency virus 1 aspartic protease inhibitor and has been repurposed as an anticancer drug. It acts by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway. Thus, it was hypothesized that nelfinavir might inhibit the NOTCH pathway via γ‑secretase inhibition and blockade of aspartic protease presenilin, which would make nelfinavir effective against NOTCH‑associated T‑ALL. The present study assessed the efficacy of nelfinavir against T‑ALL cells and investigated mechanisms of action",0
"Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a subset of ALL that demonstrated a high treatment failure rate. One of the hallmarks of Ph-like ALL is PDGFRB gene fusion, with fusion partner proteins often harboring dimerization domains and enhancing the kinase activity of PDGFRB. We determined a novel oncogenic PDGFRB fusion gene, NRIP1::PDGFRB, from a pediatric patient with ALL, encoding a protein with the carboxy-terminal kinase domain of PDGFRB, without the partner peptide. We confirmed the oncogenic potential of NRIP1::PDGFRB in vitro and the efficacy of all ABL1-specific inhibitor generations, including imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib, in suppressing this potential. PDGFRB activation mechanism may include juxtamembrane domain truncation in the predicted peptide. In conclusion, we determined a novel fusion gene pattern in Ph-like ALL.",0
"Dietary fibre, total polyphenols and phenolic acids in Spanish apples, peaches and pears were analysed and compared with their total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP). There were no significant differences in the content of dietary fibre among the studied fruits. The content of total polyphenols was 2.4 ± 0.4, 2.1 ± 0.3 and 6.9 ± 0.7 g kg−1 in peeled fruits and 4.7 ± 0.4, 4.5 ± 0.4 and 11.1 ± 1.2 g kg−1 in their peels for peaches, pears and apples respectively. The contents of dietary fibre, total polyphenols, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids and the TRAP values were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in peels than in peeled fruits. The contents of all studied compounds and the TRAP values were significantly higher in peeled apples and their peel than in peaches and pears. We observed a strong correlation between the contents of total polyphenols and phenolic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential in all three fruits. The relatively high content of dietary fibre, the highest contents of total polyphenols, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids and the highest value of TRAP make apples preferable among the studied fruits for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and other diseases.",1
"We evaluated the bioavailability and plasma antioxidative activity after administration of procyanidin B2 [epicatechin-(4β-8)-epicatechin] in rats. After procyanidin B2 administration, procyanidin B2 is absorbed and excreted in urine, and a portion of the PB2 is degraded to (−)-epicatechin and to the metabolized conjugated and/or methylated (−)-epicatechin internally in the rat. Moreover, PB2 reduces the accumulation of lipid peroxide in plasma oxidized by copper ions.",1
"Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.",1
"Asparaginase is a cornerstone in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its variant, T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), particularly in adolescents and young adults (AYA). However, its use is associated with a significant risk of thrombotic complications due to its profound effects on coagulation pathways. We report a catastrophic case of asparaginase-induced cerebral and systemic thrombosis in a previously healthy 20-year-old female with T-LBL. Despite prophylactic anticoagulation, the patient developed extensive cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism, necessitating mechanical thrombectomy, Argatroban therapy, and long-term anticoagulation. This case underscores the multifactorial pathophysiology of asparaginase-associated thrombosis and highlights the need for individualized risk assessment, vigilant monitoring, and dynamic anticoagulation strategies. A comprehensive literature review is provided to contextualize the epidemiology, mechanisms, risk factors, prevention, and management of this life-threatening complication, with practical recommendations for optimizing care in high-risk patients.",0
"Leukemia is the most prevalent form of blood cancer, affecting individuals across all age groups. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved clinical outcomes. Peripheral blood smear analysis, a key non-invasive diagnostic tool, often suffers from subjective interpretation, inter-observer variability, and a lack of readily available expertise. Although deep learning approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated exceptional performance in binary classification tasks, multiclass classification of leukemia subtypes remains challenging due to limited data availability and morphological similarities between subtypes. This study presents a novel hybrid methodology that combines pre-trained CNN architectures, including VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50, with advanced classification models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and the deep learning-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The method leverages publicly available datasets, the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB) and the Munich AML Morphology Dataset, to classify healthy cells, lymphoblasts, and myeloblasts. Pre-trained CNNs are employed for feature extraction, while the classifiers refine the predictions for improved accuracy. The proposed approach demonstrated exceptional performance, with the InceptionV3 + SVM combination achieving the highest accuracy of 88%, followed closely by VGG16 + XGBoost at 87%. MLP-based models also achieved strong results, effectively capturing non-linear patterns in the data. In contrast, ResNet50 exhibited limitations, likely due to overfitting caused by the small dataset. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of pre-trained deep learning architectures with hybrid classification techniques, enabling robust multiclass classification in data-constrained scenarios. This innovative approach offers a scalable and precise diagnostic tool, improving the speed and reliability of leukemia subtype identification and providing significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care.",0
"The antioxidant activities of a commercial brewed coffee were investigated by measuring malonaldehyde (MA) formation from oxidized cod liver oil using a gas chromatographic method (MA-GC assay) and a thiobarbituric acid method (TBA assay). The highest antioxidant activity obtained by the MA-GC assay was from regular whole brewed coffee (97.8%) at a level of 20%, and the highest antioxidant activity obtained by the TBA assay was from decaffeinated whole brewed coffee (96.6%) at a level of 5%. Among 31 chemicals identified in a dichloromethane extract, guaiacol, ethylguaiacol, and vinylguaiacol exhibited antioxidant activities, which were comparable to that of alpha-tocopherol. Among nine chlorogenic acids (three caffeoylquinic acids, three feruloylquinic acids, and three dicaffeoylquinic acids) identified, 5-caffeoylquinic acid contained the greatest amount both in regular (883.5 microg/mL) and in decaffeinated (1032.6 microg/mL) coffees; it exhibited 24.5% activity by the MA-GC assay and 45.3% activity by the TBA assay at a level of 10 microg/mL. Caffeic and ferulic acids showed moderate antioxidant activities in both assays.",1
"The antioxidative activity of skin or flesh extracts and the polyphenolic composition during the fruit development were examined in three different cultivars of apple (Malus sylvestris (L.) Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf.); ‘Fuji’ with red skin, ‘Oorin’ with yellow skin, and ‘Redfield’, a cider apple. The IC50 values of superoxide (O2−) and 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-radical-scavenging activities remained low throughout fruit development in the skin of the three cultivars. The IC50 values of the activities in the flesh of ‘Fuji’ and ‘Oorin’ were low at the beginning, but increased toward the ripening stage. In contrast, the IC50 values of the activities in the flesh of ‘Redfield’ remained low throughout fruit development. Chlorogenic acid, phloridzin, (+)-catechin, and (−)-epicatechin were detected as polyphenolics in the skin and flesh of the three cultivars. In general, the concentrations of (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin in the skin and flesh of ‘Redfield’ were higher than those in ‘Fuji’ and ‘Oorin’. Total phenolic concentrations on the fresh weight basis in the skin and flesh of three cultivars decreased towards the ripening stage. However, the total phenolic concentrations of ‘Redfield’ were higher than those of ‘Fuji’ and ‘Oorin’. These results demonstrate that the free-radical-scavenging activity in apple skin and flesh may depend on the concentration and composition of polyphenolics.",1
"Phenolic compounds in Sicilian wines were directly detected using an HPLC with a PDA detector coupled on-line with a MS system equipped with Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) source operated in the negative-ion mode and a quadrupole mass analyzer. In this work, MS spectra were recorded at different voltage, to obtain structural elucidations in addition to molecular mass informations. The different response of the compounds identified has been also evaluated. MS characteristics of cis- and trans-piceid were determined on the basis of the response obtained with the ESI interface. The method allowed both the identification and determination of 24 phenolic compounds in 22 different commercial Sicilian red wines by direct injection, without any prior purification of the sample. The data on the levels of all the phenolic compounds in the red Sicilian commercial wines showed that the wine samples from Merlot grapes generally had the highest phenolic compounds content.",1
"A study was made of the antioxidant content, activity and colour of two New Zealand commercially grown tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L. var. Excell and Aranca) cultivated in glasshouses using hydroponic techniques. Excell tomatoes were harvested and stored individually while cultivar Aranca was harvested by cutting the vine, which consisted of a group of eight tomatoes. Both cultivars of tomatoes were stored in the dark for 4 days at 15°C to simulate normal pre-purchase storing conditions. The antioxidant content of the raw tomatoes after 4 days of storage were markedly different while the CIE LAB colour values of the cut inner surfaces of the two cultivars were similar. After 4 days storage, subsamples of each cultivar were either boiled, baked or fried, and analysis of CIE colour, ascorbic acid, total phenolics, lycopene and antioxidant activity (using the ABTS assay) was undertaken. Boiling and baking had a relatively small effect on the ascorbic, total phenolic, lycopene and antioxidant activity of the two cultivars while frying significantly reduced (P<0.001) the ascorbic, total phenolic and lycopene contents of the two cultivars. Chromatic colour analysis showed that both cultivars became significantly (P<0.001) darker and less red after cooking by all methods. In a following experiment, the two cultivars of tomatoes were sliced and allowed to soak for 20min in a mixture of olive oil and white vinegar, or olive oil and white vinegar separately. CIE colour of the two cultivars showed no change after processing but the treatments of oil and vinegar separately and together reduced (P<0.05) the red component of the colour. Treating the two cultivars of tomatoes with the oil and vinegar mixture resulted in a significant reduction (P<0.001) in the ascorbic acid, total phenolic and antioxidant activity of the tomatoes. Treatment with oil significantly reduced the amount of lycopene that could be extracted from the tomatoes while treatment with vinegar had no effect.",1
"Spontaneous remission of B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in the setting of viral and bacterial infections has been reported. Here, we present a case of B-ALL that showed a complete remission in the setting of group A streptococcal bacteremia. The patient was an 11-year-old boy who presented with a sore throat, right ear pain, and rhinorrhea. Prior to the diagnosis of B-ALL, he was diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis and received a single dose of dexamethasone and azithromycin. One day later, he was found to be pancytopenic and an immunophenotypically abnormal B-lymphoblastic population was detected comprising 0.6% and 16.8% of the peripheral blood and bone marrow cells, respectively. Though a diagnosis of B-ALL was highly suspected, blast percentage was <20% and the bone marrow showed relatively unremarkable trilineage hematopoiesis. On close monitoring, the suspected neoplastic population became undetectable by day 17 and the patient's complete blood count (CBC) completely normalized by day 46. On day 82, a peripheral blood smear demonstrated circulating blasts. Flow cytometry of a bone marrow aspirate revealed B-lymphoblastic leukemia accounting for 94% nucleated cells, consistent with the diagnosis of B-lymphoblastic leukemia. This case is of interest as less than 20 examples of spontaneous remission of B-ALL have been reported in the literature. As the case reported here relapsed and previously reported spontaneously remitting cases have uniformly relapsed, cases of B-ALL with spontaneous remission should be followed very closely for recurrence.",0
"Previous surveys of the practice patterns for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in collegiate and professional team physicians have shown bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft being the most common graft, with variable return-to-sports timing. To evaluate the current practice patterns and return-to-sports timing of National Football League (NFL) head team physicians for ACL reconstruction. Cross-sectional study. All 32 NFL head team orthopaedic surgeons were surveyed and asked their primary ACL graft preference, revision ACL graft preference, use of lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) or anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALL), use of suture brace augmentation, return-to-sport timing, and whether functional testing was utilized in determining readiness of return to play. The years of experience of the physician were also evaluated. All 32 head team physicians responded, with 31 (97%) using ipsilateral BPTB autograft in the primary setting and 1 using ipsilateral quadriceps autograft. In the revision setting, 24 (75%) physicians preferred a contralateral BPTB autograft, while 5 (16%) used an ipsilateral quadriceps autograft, 1 (3%) used a contralateral quadriceps autograft, and 2 (6%) used a BPTB allograft. One respondent (3%) used suture brace augmentation ""most of the time"" in the primary setting and always in the revision setting. No respondents utilized an ALL or LET in the primary setting and 2 (6%) respondents always performed an LET in revisions. Five others (16%) have performed at least 1 ALL or LET in an NFL athlete. Mean return to sports was at 9 months postoperatively, with no physicians allowing players to return before 7 months. All but 1 respondent used functional testing in return-to-sports decision-making. All but 1 of the 32 NFL head team physicians used BPTB autograft in primary ACL reconstruction. The majority preferred contralateral BPTB autograft in revisions, with a few considering extra-articular procedures or suture bracing in addition. On average, head team physicians allowed players to return at 9 months postoperatively, with none allowing return before 7 months. Nearly all utilized functional testing to aid in return-to-play decision-making. These homogenous findings in this high-risk and public athletic cohort aid in patient education and clinical decision-making for best treatment of ACL injuries, particularly in contact athletes.",0
"Protein kinase C (PKC) signalling has been shown to be dysregulated in various cancers including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have previously determined that changes in the expression levels of SLC43A3-encoded equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (ENBT1) can significantly alter 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) toxicity in ALL cells. 6-MP is a common drug used in ALL chemotherapy. Furthermore, it has been reported that activation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) impacts nucleobase uptake via an ENBT1-like transporter in Lilly Laboratories Culture-Porcine Kidney 1 (LLC-PK1) cells. We hypothesized that activation of PKC would also alter ENBT1-mediated uptake of nucleobases in leukemia cell models. Using MOLT-4, SUP-B15, and K562 cells, we incubated the cells with PMA or its inactive isoform 4α-PMA for 30 min and determined changes to ENBT1-mediated substrate uptake. All of the cell lines tested showed decreased ENBT1-mediated substrate uptake when exposed PMA, relative to that observed using 4α-PMA. Pre-incubation with the broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor, Gö6983, reversed the decrease caused by PMA. Finally, to determine the residue responsible for this PKC-mediated effect, we transiently transfected HEK293 cells (which do not express endogenous ENBT1) with wild-type SLC43A3 transcript or constructs mutated to modify the predicted PKC sites in ENBT1. We found that the mutation of threonine 231 to alanine prevents the decrease in ENBT1-mediated uptake following incubation with PMA, suggesting its involvement. This study shows that activation of PKC decreases ENBT1-mediated uptake, suggesting that aberrant activation of PKC in ALL could decrease ENBT1-mediated 6-MP uptake potentially leading to decreased therapeutic efficacy.",0
"The quantity of mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) and of plant lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) excreted in a 24-h rat urine sample was measured after a single p.o. dose of an equivalent quantity of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG), secoisolariciresinol (SECO), matairesinol (MR), 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) and ENL. Plant lignans (SECO and HMR) were partially absorbed as such. The aglycone form of SECO was more efficiently converted into mammalian lignans END and ENL than the glycosylated form, SDG. Of plant lignans, MR produced the highest quantities of ENL: the quantity was over twofold compared with HMR or SDG. The majority of the animals, which had been given SECO, excreted higher quantities of END than ENL into urine, but ENL was the main lignan metabolite after SDG. The highest quantities of ENL in urine were measured after the administration of ENL as such. The (-)SECO isolated from Araucaria angustifolia was converted into (-)ENL only. The administration of (-)SDG, which was shown to produce (+)SECO, resulted in excretion of (+)ENL only and (-)HMR was converted into (-)ENL only. This confirmed that the absolute configurations at C8 and C8' are not changed during the microbial metabolism. Whether the biological effects are enantiomer-specific, remains to be resolved.",1
"Berries are known to contain phenolic substances (i.e., flavonoids and phenolic acids), which comprise two large and heterogeneous groups of biologically active nonnutrients. This investigation evaluated the content and profile of the phenolic compounds present in six different berries found in Northern Europe. The latter included bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), black currant (Ribes nigrum), and red currant (Ribes rubrum). The study was focused on two areas. The first involved the extraction and analysis of berries for total phenolic content and determination of their antioxidant activity. The total phenolic level of berries was correlated with their antioxidant activity. Second, the berry extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The analytes of interest included trans-resveratrol, cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin, and morin.",1
"Childhood leukemia survivors are at a lifelong risk of cardiac dysfunction due to anthracycline treatment. This study is among the first to assess pre-chemotherapy cardiac abnormalities in children newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), aiming to identify early indicators of cardiac dysfunction before anthracycline exposure. Existing literature largely focuses on cardiac damage following chemotherapy, but our findings suggest that subclinical cardiac changes may already be present at diagnosis. The cohort included 47 children diagnosed with ALL, none of whom presented clinical signs of cardiac disease. A baseline cardiac evaluation was performed before the onset of chemotherapy. Our findings demonstrated that 29.78% of patients had elevated hs-Troponin and 44.68% had elevated NT-proBNP levels before chemotherapy, with patients in the high relapse risk group (HRG) presenting significantly increased rates of abnormal values. Also, ECG abnormalities, including abnormal heart rate and PR interval, were more frequent in this group. Echocardiography revealed higher LV mass index and more diastolic dysfunction in the HRG compared to the intermediate-risk group. What is more, female patients showed greater baseline cardiac vulnerability, and younger children had proportionally higher indexed LV mass despite lower absolute LV mass. These results suggest that cancer itself may influence cardiac function before chemotherapy, potentially predisposing pediatric patients to long-term cardiac dysfunction.",0
"Adult B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) is a malignant hematologic tumor characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of B-cell lymphoblasts in the bone marrow. Despite advances in treatment, including chemotherapy and consolidation therapy, many B-ALL patients experience unfavorable prognoses due to the development of drug resistance. The precise mechanisms governing chemotherapy resistance, particularly those related to metabolic reprogramming within tumors, remain inadequately elucidated. Nalm6/DOX cells exhibited significantly elevated levels of glucose, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, and glycine compared to Nalm6 cells. Conversely, reduced levels of citrate, acetate, and leucine were observed in Nalm6/DOX cells. Upon exposure to the culture medium supplemented with tracer A new insight into the impact of metabolism on chemotherapy resistance in B-ALL has been gained through the use of stable isotope resolved metabolomics based on nuclear magnetic resonance and ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. This provides promising ways for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies to alleviate drug resistance and relapse in affected patients.",0
"We report a case of acute myeloid leukemia with megakaryoblastic differentiation (AMKL) that developed after an initial B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with low hypodiploidy. Although the AMKL was initially thought either to be a phenotypic change from the original B-ALL or to have arisen as a result of treatment (acute myeloid leukemia, post cytotoxic therapy, AML-pCT [WHO]; AML, therapy related [ICC]), genetic evaluation of both the AMKL and the B-ALL suggest that neither of these considerations was correct. Rather, the AMKL did not harbor the most common genetic hallmark of AML-pCT-rearrangement of",0
"High hyperdiploidy, the largest and favorable subtype of childhood ALL, exhibits significant biological and prognostic heterogeneity. However, factors contributing to the varied treatment response and the optimal definition of hyperdiploidy remain uncertain. We analyzed outcomes of patients treated on two consecutive frontline ALL protocols, using six different definitions of hyperdiploidy: chromosome number 51-67 (Chr51-67); DNA index (DI; DI1.16-1.6); United Kingdom ALL study group low-risk hyperdiploid, either trisomy of chromosomes 17 and 18 or +17 or +18 in the absence of +5 and +20; single trisomy of chromosome 18; double trisomy of chromosomes 4 and 10; and triple trisomy (TT) of chromosomes 4, 10, and 17. Additionally, we characterized ALL ex vivo pharmacotypes across eight main cytotoxic drugs. Among 1,096 patients analyzed, 915 had B-ALL and 634 had pharmacotyping performed. In univariate analysis, TT emerged as the most favorable criterion for event-free survival (EFS; 10-year EFS, 97.3% Among different definitions of hyperdiploid ALL, DI is optimal based on independent prognostic impact and also the large proportion of low-risk patients identified. Hyperdiploid ALL exhibited particular sensitivities to asparaginase and mercaptopurine, with chromosome-specific associations.",0
"The total content of phenolics in broad beans ranged from 276 to 794 mg/kg of sample on a dry weight basis (dwb), while in peas varied from 144 to 691 mg/kg of sample (dwb). Broad beans contained a higher level of proanthocyanidins than peas. Proanthocyanidins were the predominant phenolics in beans and peas. Phenolics were mostly located in seed coats. The methanolic extracts of phenolics from both broad beans and peas showed great inhibitory effects towards both lipase and lipoxygenase activities.",1
"The study was conducted to assess the content of tocopherols (α-, β-, γ- and δ-) and carotenoids (α- and β-carotene, zeaxanthin, lutein, cryptoxanthin and lycopene) in the unsaponifiable matter as well as the amount of total phenols of 10 different types of nuts. Tocopherols and carotenoids were analysed with HPLC, total phenols photometrically. The mean value of α-tocopherol equivalents ranged from non-detectable (macadamias) to 33.1mg/100g extracted oil (hazelnuts). Among all nuts, almonds and hazelnuts had the highest mean α-tocopherol content (24.2 and 31.4mg/100g extracted oil, respectively). β- and γ-tocopherols were prevalent in Brazil nuts, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pines, pistachios and walnuts. Mean values oscillated between 5.1 (cashews) and 29.3 (pistachios). Traces of δ-tocopherol (<4mg/100g extracted oil) were analysed in cashews, hazelnuts, peanuts, pecans, pines, pistachios and walnuts. There were no carotenoids detected in the tested nuts with the exception of pistachios. The mean content of total phenolics varied between 32mg gallic acid equivalents/100g (pines) and 1625mg (walnuts). The results show the heterogenic amounts of antioxidants in nuts, which emphasises the recommendation of a mixed nuts intake.",1

"The contents of flavonol glucosides in yellow, red and white onions harvested in Hokkaido were measured. Seven varieties of yellow onion averaged 16.8mg/100g of quercetin-3, 4'-di-O-β-glucoside, 18.5mg/100g of quercetin-4'-O-β-glucoside, 0.8mg/100g of quercetin-3-O-β-glucoside and 2.9 mg/100g of isorhamnetin-4'-O-β-glucoside. The red onion contained about 3-fold the amount of these glucosides while the white onion contained no detectable amounts of flavonols. The content of each flavonoid was higher in the outer scales than in the inner ones. Flavonol glucosidases and UDPG: flavonol glucosyltransferases were detected in the onions. The optimum pH of quercetin-3O-β-glucosyltransferase, 4'-O-β-glucosyltransferase, 3-O-β-glucosidase and 4'-O-β-glucosidase was 6.0, 8.0, 4.5 and 7.0, respectively. In all the onion varieties, the activity of quercetin-4'-β- ",1
"Oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is thought to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. The present study examined inhibitory effect of jasmine green tea polyphenol (GTP) extracts and its individual epicatechin isomers on Cu+2-mediated oxidation of human LDL. The jasmine tea GTP extracts consisted mainly of four epicatechin isomers with (−) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) being most abundant (51.2%) followed by (−) epigallocatechin (EGC, 18.7%), (−) epicatechin (EC, 12.3%), and (−) epicatechin gallate (ECG, 11.8%). Jasmine tea GTP as a mixture or its four epicatechin isomers demonstrated strong antioxidant activity in Cu+2-mediated oxidation of human LDL. The inhibitory effect of these epicatechin isomers on LDL oxidation was dose-dependent at the concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 μM. EC and EGC were less protective against LDL oxidation than their gallate derivatives, ECG and EGCG, respectively. ECG and EGCG seemed to have a similar antioxidant activity. In contrast, EGC was less effective than EC as an antioxidant against LDL oxidation. The inhibitory effect of jasmine green tea epicatechin isomers on Cu+2-mediated oxidation was also characterized by protecting docosahexaenoic, arachidonic, α-linolenic, and linoleic acid in LDL against oxidative degradation. We conclude that, in addition to their hypocholesterolemic effect, jasmine tea epicatechin isomers may serve as a source of natural antioxidative agents in human diet.",1
"Epidemiological studies have associated high soy intake with a lowered risk for certain hormone-dependent diseases. Soy and soy foods are rich sources of isoflavones, which have been shown to possess several biological activities. In this study, the metabolism of soy isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein was investigated in human subjects. The aim was to find and identify urinary phase I metabolites of isoflavones, which have an intact isoflavonoid skeleton, and which might possess some bioactivity. Six volunteers included three soy bars per day into their normal western diet for a 2-week period. Daily urine samples were collected before, and after the supplementation period. Urine samples were hydrolyzed with Helix pomatia, extracted with diethyl ether, purified with Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, and analyzed as trimethylsilyl derivatives using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The structures of the isoflavone metabolites were identified using authentic reference compounds. The metabolites, for which authentic reference compounds were not available, were identified by the interpretation of mass spectra. Several new isoflavone metabolites were identified, and the presence of previously reported metabolites confirmed. The metabolic pathways of daidzein, genistein and glycitein are presented on the basis of the identification of the metabolites in human urine after soy supplementation.",1
"Proper nutrition during cancer treatment is crucial for children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as malnutrition can impact treatment tolerance, survival, and quality of life. In ALL specifically, malnutrition at diagnosis has been associated with increased risk of infections, treatment delays, and poorer survival, while maintaining adequate nutritional status can improve treatment tolerance and long-term outcomes. We developed and tested the ""Hematognam"" app, which provides caregivers with dietary guidance for children and adolescents undergoing chemotherapy. This study evaluates the app's feasibility and usability among families of children and adolescents with ALL over a three-month period. The app received high satisfaction ratings, which suggests its user-centric design and relevance in managing complex dietary challenges associated with treatment. These results align with previous studies demonstrating the potential of digital health tools to enhance treatment compliance and overall well-being in vulnerable populations. By addressing key nutritional challenges faced by children and adolescents with ALL - such as appetite loss, food aversions, gastrointestinal side effects, and food safety concerns - the ""Hematognam"" app offers a complementary tool to existing dietary counseling, supporting both families and clinicians in daily nutritional management. The development and implementation of the ""Hematognam"" app proved feasible and effective in addressing the nutritional needs of children and adolescents with ALL during chemotherapy.",0
"ABSTRACT: Four cultivars of sour cherries (Balaton, Karneol, Kroeker and Northstar), 2 cultivars of plums (BY 8158.50 and Methley), and 1 red raspberry cv. Prelude were analyzed for total phenolics, antioxidant capacity, and total anthocyanins before and after jam production to evaluate their changes after thermal processing. Fruits had total phenolics ranging from 245.7 to 398.5 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g. Antioxidant capacity of fruits ranged from 354.8 to 692.3 mg/100 g, expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). Total anthocyanins of fruits ranged from 30.9 to 67.1 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalent (CGE)/100 g. In 100 g of jam, total phenolics varied from 132.9 to 218.9 mg GAE, while antioxidant capacity ranged from 205.6 to 373.5 mg/100 g VCEAC. Jams had total anthocyanins of 5.4 to 30.4 mg CGE/100 g. On the basis of fresh fruit (100 g), the processing and heating during jam making generally decreased the contents of total phenolics, VCEAC, and total anthocyanins. Major losses occurred in anthocyanin content where overall retention varied from 89% to 21%. HPLC analysis of individual anthocyanins from cherry cv. Balaton to its jam showed that processing caused 90% decrease in anthocyanins. The results indicated that more than 73% total phenolics and more than 65% antioxidant capacity were retained after processing fruits into jams. Optimization of food processing would help to conserve the bioactive phenolic compounds in fruits.",1
"Employing gradient elution HPLC with direct injection of 20 µL of sample and diode array detection, the (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin concentrations were determined in >800 red wines from different wine-producing regions. The concentrations of both were highest in wines vinted from Pinot noir in all regions where this cultivar is grown, with red Burgundy and Canadian wines having the highest concentrations. Among wines vinted exclusively or predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, the highest catechin concentrations were found in wines from Washington State and Bordeaux (Medoc) with highest values for epicatechin in wines from Bordeaux and Canada. Next to wines from Pinot noir, those from Merlot had the highest in concentrations and wines from Shiraz the lowest. The ratio catechin: epicatechin showed considerable variation among the different cultivars, highest values for this ratio being found in wines from Pinot Noir and lowest in wines from Shiraz. Regression analysis revealed a variable but significant relationship between the two compounds, with the correlation coefficient ranging between 0.460 (Rhône Valley) to 0.917 (Oregon Pinot noir). Their relationship demonstrated a significant independent component, probably a consequence of genetic factors determining their concentrations in individual cultivars. However, their distribution is reminiscent of the pattern shown by resveratrol free isomers, suggesting that, in addition to cultivar, fungal pressure and climatic stress may promote their synthesis by Vitis vinifera.",1
"The concentrations of trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and quercetin were evaluated by means of high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection in red wines obtained from Aglianico, Piedirosso, and Nerello Mascalese grapes. The trans-resveratrol and epicatechin concentrations did not differ significantly between experimental wines. The concentration of quercetin in Nerello Mascalese wines was more than twice that observed in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Nerello Mascalese wines also significantly differed from other wines in the (+)-catechin content, which was significantly higher than those found in the other two wines. During maceration, the maximum extraction of trans-resveratrol was reached after 12 days for Aglianico and Piedirosso, after which a decline was observed. On the contrary, in the case of Nerello Mascalese, the concentration of trans-resveratrol increased steadily throughout the whole maceration process. After 2 days of maceration, the maximum concentration of quercetin was observed in Aglianico must, whereas the maximum quercetin extraction was reached after 12 days for Piedirosso and 17 days for Nerello Mascalese. The maximum levels of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were generally observed after 12 days of maceration for all wines, although a decline of (-)-epicatechin occurred after maximum extraction in Aglianico and Piedirosso wines. Following marc pressing, a significant increase in the concentration of trans-resveratrol for Aglianico, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin for Piedirosso, and (-)-epicatechin for Nerello Mascalese was observed.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer in children (age 0-14 years); however, the etiology remains incompletely understood. Several environmental exposures have been linked to risk of childhood ALL, including air pollution. Closely related to air pollution and human development is artificial light at night (ALAN), which is believed to disrupt circadian rhythm and impact health. We sought to evaluate outdoor ALAN and air pollution on risk of childhood ALL. The California Linkage Study of Early-Onset Cancers is a large population-based case-control in California that identifies and links cancer diagnoses from the California Cancer Registry to birth records. For each case, 50 controls with the same year of birth were obtained from birth records. A total of 2,782 ALL cases and 139,100 controls were identified during 2000-2015. ALAN was assessed with the New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness and air pollution with an ensemble-based air pollution model of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns (PM",0
"Some flavonoid compounds, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, and quercetin, generally present in fruit juices were separated and determined by high performance liquid chromatography using a C6-phenyl-phase column and diode array detector. The method was partly validated with good results. Flavanones naringin, hesperidin, and neohesperidin were identified as markers of 100% Citrus juices. Their contents in analysed juices were compared with published values established by extensive research of Citrus composition. Quercetin, as a constituent of grapefruit and some other fruit juices, was also studied.",1
"High levels of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) lead to immunotherapy resistance. Our study showed that ASNS overexpression (OE) in NALM6-GL cancer cells attenuated chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-mediated cancer cell lysis. Asparaginase (ASPG) is an approved drug that breaks down circulating asparagine in leukemia cells, thereby depriving cancer cells of asparagine and inhibiting cancer growth. We proposed a hypothesis that ASPG-engineered CAR-T cells undergo phenotype switching to overcome immunotherapy resistance in ALL. Coculture killing assay showed ASPG-OE CAR-T cells exhibited increased killing efficacy against ASNS-OE cancer cells by enhancing the expression of granzyme B, interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas ASPG-knockout (KO) CAR-T cells showed decreased cancer cell lysis efficiency. Phenotypic analysis revealed that ASPG-OE CAR-T cells exhibited distinct phenotypes, including increasing central memory T cells percentage, while decreasing effector memory T cells and effector memory cells that re-expressed CD45RA cells proportions. This distinct phenotype switch of ASPG-OE CAR-T cells toward central memory T cells exerted the increased killing efficacy against NALM6-GL cells even without ASNS-OE. The in vivo xenograft mouse model confirmed that ASPG-OE CAR-T cells exhibited superior anticancer activity against NALM6-GL cancer cells, while ASPG-KO CAR-T cells exhibited inferior anticancer activity. Taken together, ASPG orchestrates CAR-T cell distinct phenotype toward central memory T cells and reprogramming of asparagine metabolism for enhancing antitumor immunity.",0
"Literature regarding prognostic relevance of CD20 antigen expression among paediatric B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) patients is sparse and contradictory. We analysed clinical laboratory parameters and survival characteristics pertinent to CD20 expression among 224 treatment-naïve paediatric B-ALL patients. 50% patients had CD20 expression (CD20+ B-ALL). There was no difference in the clinical & laboratory presentation and end of induction measurable residual disease (EOI-MRD) status according to CD20 expression. As compared to CD20- B-ALL patients, CD20+ B-ALL patients had two times more relapse (16% vs. 29%, p = 0.034), inferior relapse-free survival (79% vs. 66%, p = 0.025) but no difference in overall survival (75% vs. 69%, p = 0.126). Similar to high-risk NCI status and EOI-MRD positivity, CD20 expression was an independent predictor for inferior relapse-free survival (HR: 1.860, 95% CI: 1.008-3.432, p = 0.047). Compared to baseline, there was a significant increase in CD20-expressing EOI-residual blasts among CD20- B-ALL patients (5% vs. 13%, p = 0.001). EOI residual blasts of both CD20+ and CD20- patients had three times increased normalized CD20 expression intensity (nCD20), with the intensity among CD20- B-ALL patients reaching the pretreatment nCD20 of CD20+ B-ALL patients (4.9 vs. 3.6, p = 0.666). Rituximab can be considered in managing EOI-MRD-positive CD20- B-ALL patients as the residual blasts of these patients have quantitative and qualitative increases in CD20 expression.",0
"Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is a rare but serious condition typically associated with malignancy. While lung cancer and lymphoma are common causes, less frequent aetiologies can present a diagnostic challenge. We report a case of a young adult female who presented with classical symptoms of SVCS, including facial oedema, neck vein distention and dyspnoea. Diagnostic workup revealed a large mediastinal mass, which was subsequently confirmed as T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) on biopsy. This case highlights the importance of considering T-ALL in the differential diagnosis of SVCS, particularly in younger individuals without traditional risk factors. Early recognition and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, including chemotherapy and potentially radiation therapy, are crucial for optimal patient outcomes. This case underscores the need for a high index of suspicion for rare malignancies, even in the context of common presentations.",0
"Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.",1
"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a class of persistent environmental pollutants with potential carcinogenic effects, but their impact on childhood cancer remains underexplored. A child's exposure to PFAS can occur through various pathways postnatally, including contaminated food, water, and consumer products; and in utero, as PFAS can cross the placenta. To investigate the association between early-life PFAS exposure and the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we analyzed archived blood samples from children diagnosed with ALL and matched cancer-free controls. Using novel untargeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), we measured PFAS levels in paired maternal pregnancy and child newborn blood samples. Our study identified an independent association between MeFOSAA levels at birth and increased ALL risk, particularly among children diagnosed at 2 years of age or younger. MeFOSAA measured in maternal second-trimester blood showed a weak association with ALL, although it was not statistically significant. These results suggest that early-life exposure to MeFOSAA may play a critical role in the development of childhood ALL. Our findings corroborate previous reports linking MeFOSAA exposure during pregnancy to childhood ALL, highlighting its potential carcinogenicity during key developmental windows.",0
"Glucuronide conjugates of soy isoflavone metabolites genistein, daidzein, glycitein and equol in urinary samples from women, female pigs and female rats were pretreated with methanol instead of solid phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction after enzymatic digestion. The samples were analyzed using an LC-ESI-MS/MS ion trap system. Analysis of rat liver sample using this procedure was also attempted. By comparison the elution sequences with results from previous studies, glucuronide conjugates including 7-gluc-Dai, 7-gluc-Gly, 4′-gluc-Dai, 7-gluc-Gen, then 4′-gluc-Gen were identified sequentially in women urine. However, 5-gluc-Gen was also observed in female porcine urine. In rat urine, sul-Dai was observed after 7-gluc-Dai, while 7-gluc-Equ and 4′-gluc-Equ were observed after 7-gluc-Gen. The metabolite profiles in rat liver tissue samples were found with 7-gluc-Dai and 7-gluc-Gen. However, glucuronide conjugates of equol and sulfate conjugate of daidzein were only found in rat urine. Interestingly, quantification studies performed by LC-APCI/MS and LC-ECD showed that the aglycone and conjugated glycitein were both found in porcine and rat urine, but only conjugated glycitein was found in woman urine.",1
"1. Following oral administration of ellagic acid to the rat, 10% of the dose was excreted as 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one in urine and faeces. A second metabolite was detected in urine and faeces but not identified. Both metabolites were of microfloral origin, as their formation was not observed in germ-free rats but was demonstrated when ellagic acid was incubated in vitro with micro-organisms from rat gastro-intestinal tract. 2. Following intraperitoneal, but not oral, administration of ellagic acid, a third metabolite was detected in urine. 3. Unchanged ellagic acid was not detected in faeces or urine of any normal rat examined, but small amounts were detected in the faeces of germ-free animals. 4. Following oral administration of ellagic acid, two conjugates of 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one were detected in bile, whereas intraperitoneal administration resulted in the biliary excretion of three conjugates of an unidentified metabolite.",1
"Fatigue is a common and debilitating side effect of chronic diseases, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. While physical exercise and psychological treatments have been shown to reduce fatigue, patients often struggle with adherence to these interventions in clinical practice. Game-based eHealth interventions are believed to address adherence issues by making the intervention more accessible and engaging. This study aims to compile empirical evidence on game-based eHealth interventions for fatigue in individuals with chronic diseases and to evaluate their effectiveness in alleviating fatigue. A comprehensive literature search was performed across Embase, MEDLINE ALL, PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar in August 2021. Study characteristics and outcomes from the included studies were extracted, and a random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity. Of 1742 studies identified, 17 were included in the meta-analysis. These studies covered 5 different chronic diseases: multiple sclerosis (n=10), cancer (n=3), renal disease (n=2), stroke (n=1), and Parkinson disease (n=1). All but 1 study used exergaming interventions. The meta-analysis revealed a significant moderate effect size in reducing fatigue favoring the experimental interventions (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.65, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.21, P=.003) compared with control conditions consisting of conventional care and no care. However, heterogeneity was high (I2=85.87%). Subgroup analyses were conducted for the 2 most prevalent diseases. The effect size for the multiple sclerosis subgroup showed a trend in favor of eHealth interventions (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.95 to 0.01, P=.05, I2=63.10%), but was not significant for the cancer group (SMD 0.61, 95% CI -0.36 to 1.58, P=.22). Balance exercises appeared particularly effective in reducing fatigue (SMD -1.19, 95% CI -1.95 to -0.42, P=.002). Game-based eHealth interventions appear effective in reducing fatigue in individuals with chronic diseases. Further research is needed to reinforce these findings and explore their impact on specific diseases. Additionally, there is a lack of investigation into interventions beyond exergaming within the field of game-based learning.",0
"Sesame lignans have multiple functions and were recently reported to have potential as sources of phytoestrogens. Sesame oils used in Taiwan are expelled from roasted sesame seeds with dark colour and strong flavour. This study analyzed lignan contents of 14 brands of sesame oils, and found their mean of total lignans to be 11.5mg/g; 82% and 15% of the lignans were sesamin, and sesamolin, respectively. Sesamol contents were relatively higher in those with darker colour. In use as a cooking oil, heating at 180°C for 4min did not change the content of lignans, but the level of sesamol increased after heating at 180°C for 20min. Heating at 200°C for 20min caused a significant loss of sesamolin and sesamol. From our calculation, ingestion of 10g of sesame oil is adequate to provide the level of lignans that might benefit cardiovascular health, as found by other studies. Cooking at temperatures above 200°C will cause loss of some lignans, but sesamin, a source of phytoestrogen, is relatively heat-stable.",1
"A fast and effective dynamic sonication assisted ethanol extraction method was developed for extracting phenolic acids from basil, oregano, rosemary, sage, spearmint and thyme of the Lamiaceae family. The results were compared with results obtained by conventional solvent extraction techniques. A comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC x LC) system interfaced to electrospray ionisation time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was then optimised for analysis and quantification of the herb extracts. The optimised LC x LC system employed a combination of C18 and cyano columns. The relative standard deviations for the retention times were better than 0.05% (rosmarinic acid 0.1%) and those for the peak areas 2-14% (2 mg/l, n=3). Limits of detection were 18-90 ng/ml. The LC x LC-MS method was applied to the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids, and the results were compared with those obtained with conventional LC-MS.",1

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) etiology remains largely unknown; incidence patterns by age, sex, and geographical distribution suggest a potential environmental role. To identify ALL clusters from four contrasting urban areas of Mexico and to characterize the sources of environmental carcinogens. Hospital-based ALL cases (n = 443) diagnosed in children <19 years old from the Metropolitan Zones of Merida and San Luis Potosi, the State of Mexico, and Tijuana were analyzed (2015-2020). ALL cases were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology. ALL clusters were identified by Kernel Density, and excess risk was estimated. Data of particulate matter ≤2.5 µm (PM The survival rate for ALL ranged from 61.5% to 78.6%. Seven ALL clusters with excess risk (RR 1.4-2.3, p < 0.05) were identified. The carcinogen sources included artisanal brick kilns, gas stations, cement works, carpentry, paint, and chemical manufacturing establishments. PM ALL clusters were identified at the community level; the excess risk could be explained by small-scale carcinogen sources. The levels of PM",0
"Seven varieties of post-harvest apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) fruit, i.e., Spartan, McIntosh, Newtown, Royal Gala, Jonagold, Red Delicious, and Golden Delicious, were examined for the presence and location of condensed tannins in the peel, pulp, and seeds. Statistically significant differences in the condensed tannin content were found between varieties and sources, and in different tissues within a variety. Red Delicious had the greatest amount of condensed tannin in the peel and pulp, whereas Golden Delicious had the least. The amount in the seed was low and variable. Light and electron microscopy revealed tannins in the hypodermal layers of the peel, near the floral bundles in the cortex of the pulp, and in the thick-walled sclerenchyma and crushed parenchyma of the testa. The condensed tannin deposits in the peel appeared most concentrated in the hypodermal cell layer adjacent to the epidermis, with lesser amounts in cell layers closer to the cortex. Electron micrographs revealed that condensed tannin deposits were always found in the vacuole, taking different forms, and mainly associated with the tonoplast. Key words: condensed tannins, apple, peel, pulp, seed, vanillin–HCl, microscopy.",1
"To evaluate the effect of low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) therapy on immunocyte subsets and its side effects in children with solid tumor.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic antioxidant and squalene content in a range of olive and seed oils. A mean of 290 +/- 38 (SEM) mg squalene/100 g was detected. However, while there was a weak significant difference between extra virgin (424 +/- 21 mg/kg) and refined virgin (340 +/- 31 mg/100 g; P<0.05) olive oils, highly significant differences were evident between extra virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) refined virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) and seed oils (24 +/- 5 mg/100 g). While seed oils were devoid, on average, the olive oils contained 196 +/- 19 mg/kg total phenolics as judged by HPLC analysis, but the value for extra virgin (232 +/- 15 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that of refined virgin olive oil (62 +/- 12 mg/kg; P<0.0001). Appreciable quantities of simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) were detected in olive oils, with significant differences between extravirgin (41.87 +/- 6.17) and refined virgin olive oils (4.72 +/- 215; P<0.01). The major linked phenols were secoiridoids and lignans. Although extra virgin contained higher concentrations of secoiridoids (27.72 +/- 6.84) than refined olive oils (9.30 +/- 3.81) this difference was not significant. On the other hand, the concentration of lignans was significantly higher (P<0.001) in extra virgin (41.53 +/- 3.93) compared to refined virgin olive oils (7.29 +/- 2.56). All classes of phenolics were shown to be potent antioxidants. In future epidemiologic studies, both the nature and source of olive oil consumed should be differentiated in ascertaining cancer risk.",1

"Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using precursor ion and product ion analyses. Anthocyanins were excreted in intact forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary excretion of anthocyanins reached a maximum concentration (1091.8 +/- 1081.3 pmol/L, n = 10) during the 4-8 h period after black raspberry ingestion. As compared to the anthocyanin distribution in black raspberries, urinary cyanidin 3-xylosylrutinoside was detected at a higher concentration than that of cyanidin-3-rutinoside.",1
"A rapid HPLC-diode array detection (DAD) method was developed for the routine analysis of 16 anthocyanins in wine. Direct injection of filtered wine samples followed by selective detection at 520 nm allowed quantitation of these compounds in red wines. The method was linear for malvidin-3-glucoside over the range 5-250ppm, and the limit of detection for this compound was 0.18 ppm. A volatile mobile phase is used, which enables hyphenation to mass spectrometry (MS). With HPLC-MS, a total of 44 pigments could be identified in South African wines. Obtained mass spectra are discussed for a series of representative wine constituents and results are compared with literature references. An attempt was made to differentiate between different cultivars according to the anthocyanin content using stepwise forward linear discriminant analysis (LDA).",1
"'Arnoia' peppers (Capsicum annuum L. var. annuum cv. Arnoia) are cultivated in areas surrounding the Arnoia River, in Galicia (northwest Spain). Some physical and chemical changes associated with maturation and storage conditions have been reported. Changes in gross composition, the main physico-chemical parameters and mineral composition were evaluated in peppers collected directly from plants and at two different states of maturity (green and red fruits), and in commercially available peppers (green fruits). The total soluble solid content and titratable acidity increased significantly during ripening. The fat, ash and protein contents were generally significantly higher in the red pepper than in the green peppers. The total ascorbic acid in red peppers was 27% higher than that of green peppers. The vitamin C content of commercially available green peppers was up to 39% lower than in the freshly picked peppers. Potassium was the most abundant mineral in green and red peppers. Green peppers purchased in the supermarket contained higher amounts of calcium and sodium than the freshly picked peppers. The levels of zinc, manganese and copper were similar in all of the different samples.",1
"Haemato-oncology has made significant progress in recent years, particularly through the development of innovative immunotherapeutic approaches such as CAR T cell (chimeric antigen receptor T cell) and tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies. Both methods use the patient's own immune system to treat cancer, but in different ways. CAR T cell therapy is a form of immunotherapy in which the patient's own T cells are genetically modified. CAR T cell therapies have proven to be particularly effective in haematological B-cell neoplasms, such as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) and B-cell lymphomas, as well as in multiple myeloma. Tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, on the other hand, exploits the natural ability of T cells to recognise tumour-associated antigens of tumour cells with the T cell receptor. Tumour tissue is taken from the patient then tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes are isolated from it. These tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes are expanded ex vivo to increase their number and activity. This review discusses the principles of these innovative therapies. Both therapies represent significant advances in personalised cancer treatment and offer new hope for our cancer patients.",0
"Samples of tea (Quingmao, steamed, black and Pu'er) produced in Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China, from the locally characteristic large-leaved Camellia sinensis, have been brewed and the brews analysed for their contents of flavonol glycosides, flavan-3-ols and their oxidation products. Several samples of Pu'er tea manufactured in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were also examined. The brews prepared from Quingmao tea and steamed green tea leaf were very similar containing primarily flavan-3-ols accompanied by flavonol glycosides, theogallin and gallic acid. The profile of flavanols was unusual, being dominated by (−)-epicatechingallate (rather than (−)-epigallocatechingallate) and by an unusually large (+)-catechin content. The brew of the equivalent black tea retained significant amounts of residual flavanols (particularly (−)-epicatechingallate and (+)-catechin), and contained significant amounts of thearubigins, theaflavic acids and theaflavins (including the less common analogues probably derived from the oxidation of (+)-catechin). The brews prepared from the Puer teas were distinguishable from the black tea brew by the absence of theaflavins and theaflavic acids, and by much smaller residues of flavanois and flavonol glycosides. The contents of thearubigins varied considerably whereas those of gallic acid were similar.",1
"The herbs of lemon balm, oregano, and peppermint were analysed immediately after harvest and after drying to determine their antioxidant activity and content of total phenolics, l-ascorbic acid, and carotenoids. The strongest inhibition of linoleic acid (LA) peroxidation was found for fresh and dried oregano. For peppermint and lemon balm it was significantly lower and decreased after drying. The ability to scavenge the free radical DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) was very high in almost all tested samples, exceeding 90%. The three species tested had a very high content of total phenolics and drying of oregano and peppermint resulted in their considerable increase. The highest content of ascorbic acid was determined in fresh peppermint and lemon balm and carotenoid content was at a similar level in all the species tested. Drying caused great losses of these compounds.",1
" In this work we have determined the variations in the composition of phenolic compounds of natural peach and apple juice with different thermal and enzymatic treatments. The following phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in samples of treated and untreated fruit juices: cinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids), cinnamic derivatives (chlorogenic and p-coumarylquinic acids and feruloylglucose), flavonols (quercetin glycosides), dihydrochalcones (phloretin glycosides), flavan-3-ols [(+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin], and procyanidins (dimer B2, trimer C1 and tetramer T4). Furfural derivatives, compounds widely used as indicators of prior thermal treatment, were also studied using these samples. The results indicate that the different processes tested gave rise to a series of changes in composition that may make it possible to identify the type of treatment employed on the basis of the composition of phenolic compounds in the fruit juices.",1
"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have been introduced for immunoglobulin (IG)/T-cell receptor (TR) gene rearrangement analysis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma (LBL). These methods likely constitute faster and more sensitive approaches to analyze heterogenous cases of ALL/LBL, yet it is not known whether gene rearrangements constituting low percentages of the total sequence reads represent minor subpopulations of malignant cells or background IG/TR gene rearrangements in normal B-and T-cells. In a comparison of eight cases of B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) using both the EuroClonality NGS method and the IdentiClone multiplex-PCR/gene-scanning method, the NGS method identified between 29% and 139% more markers than the gene-scanning method, depending on whether the NGS data analysis used a threshold of 5% or 1%, respectively. As an alternative to using low thresholds, we show that IG/TR gene rearrangements in subpopulations of cancer cells can be discriminated from background IG/TR gene rearrangements in normal B-and T-cells through a combination of flow cytometry cell sorting and multiple displacement amplification (MDA)-based whole genome amplification (WGA) prior to the NGS. Using this approach to investigate the clonal evolution in a BCP-ALL patient with double relapse, clonal TR rearrangements were found in sorted leukemic cells at the time of second relapse that could be identified at the time of diagnosis, below 1% of the total sequence reads. These data emphasize that caution should be exerted when interpreting rare sequences in NGS experiments and show the advantage of employing the flow sorting of malignant cell populations in NGS clonality assessments.",0
"The US Food and Drug Administration has approved TNF(Tumor necrosis factor) alpha inhibitors to manage a range of inflammatory conditions, including Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other inflammatory disorders. However, these inhibitors can potentially increase the risk of secondary blood malignancies due to TNF alpha's role in various cellular processes such as angiogenesis, cell cycle proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. In this article, we present a unique case study of a patient who developed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) while receiving adalimumab, a potent monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to TNF-alpha. We describe the patient's successful treatment using standard-of-care chemotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, resulting in complete remission with no measurable residual disease. Furthermore, we conducted a literature review on this subject and identified five similar cases of ALL associated with TNF alpha inhibitors.",0
"Effects of temperature on the autoxidation and antioxidants changes of soybean, sunflower, and olive oils were studied. The oils were oxidized in the dark at 25, 40, 60, and 80 °C. The oil oxidation was determined by peroxide (POV) and p-anisidine values (PAV). Polyphenols and tocopherols in the oils were also monitored. The oxidation of oils increased with the oxidation time and temperature. Induction period decreased with the oxidation temperature; 87 and 3.6 days at 25 and 60 °C, respectively, for sunflower oil. The activation energies for the autoxidation of soybean, sunflower, and olive oils were 17.6, 19.0, and 12.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Olive oil contained polyphenols at 180.8 ppm, and tocopherols were present at 687, 290, and 104 ppm in soybean, sunflower, and olive oils, respectively. Antioxidants were degraded during the oil autoxidation and the degradation rates increased with the oxidation temperature of oils; for tocopherols, 2.1 × 10−3 and 8.9 × 10−2%/day at 25 and 60 °C, respectively, in soybean oil.",1
"This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols (17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.",1
"Effects of processing, such as dehulling, sprouting, soaking, cooking, roasting, and autoclaving, on total phenols, and chemical constituents in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) and climbing bean (Vigna umbellata), cultivated in Nigeria, were investigated. All the processing methods reduced the levels of total phenols in both the legumes to varying extents. Cooking of soaked, and dehulled seeds had the most pronounced lowering effect on the total phenolic contents, of pigeonpea, and climing bean, by 49 and 50%, respectively. Sprouting of the legume seeds increased the protein content, and significantly reduced the carbohydrate contents (P lt 0.05). These processing methods altered the composition of both the legumes, without effecting any change in carbohydrates.",1
"Ellagitannin-containing foods (strawberries, walnuts, pomegranate, raspberries, oak-aged wine, etc.) have attracted attention due to their cancer chemopreventive, cardioprotective, and antioxidant effects. Ellagitannins (ETs) are not absorbed as such but are metabolized by the intestinal flora to yield urolithins (hydroxydibenzopyran-6-one derivatives). In this study, Iberian pig is used as a model to clarify human ET metabolism. Pigs were fed either cereal fodder or acorns, a rich source of ETs. Plasma, urine, bile, lumen and intestinal tissues (jejunum and colon), feces, liver, kidney, heart, brain, lung, muscle, and subcutaneous fat tissue were analyzed. The results demonstrate that acorn ETs release ellagic acid (EA) in the jejunum, then the intestinal flora metabolizes EA sequentially to yield tetrahydroxy- (urolithin D), trihydroxy- (urolithin C), dihydroxy- (urolithin A), and monohydroxy- (urolithin B) dibenzopyran-6-one metabolites, which were absorbed preferentially when their lipophilicity increased. Thirty-one ET-derived metabolites were detected, including 25 urolithin and 6 EA derivatives. Twenty-six extensively conjugated metabolites were detected in bile, glucuronides and methyl glucuronides of EA and particularly urolithin A, C, and D derivatives, confirming a very active enterohepatic circulation. Urolithins A and B as well as dimethyl-EA-glucuronide were detected in peripheral plasma. The presence of EA metabolites in bile and in urine and its absence in intestinal tissues suggested its absorption in the stomach. Urolithin A was the only metabolite detected in feces and together with its glucuronide was the most abundant metabolite in urine. No metabolites accumulated in any organ analyzed. The whole metabolism of ETs is shown for the first time, confirming previous studies in humans and explaining the long persistency of urolithin metabolites in the body mediated by an active enterohepatic circulation.",1
"The nature of quercetin conjugates present in blood after consumption of quercetin glucosides is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed plasma of volunteers that had consumed 325 micromol of either quercetin-3-glucoside or quercetin-4'-glucoside as an oral solution. Quercetin metabolites were extracted with acetonitrile/phosphoric acid and these extracts were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography with Coularray detection that distinguishes between the glucuronidated and the glucosylated forms of quercetin. No intact quercetin glucosides and only trace amounts of aglycone were found in human plasma, irrespective of the glucoside ingested. This was confirmed by spiking the plasma with glucoside standards. The major components in plasma had the same retention time as quercetin glucuronide standards. These plasma components disappeared after treatment of the plasma with bovine liver beta-glucuronidase, under reformation of quercetin, and showed the same oxidation pattern as the glucuronides. These results suggest that after consumption of quercetin glucosides, quercetin glucuronides are major metabolites in plasma.",1
"Monovarietal Picual olive oils possibly represent 25% of the world's olive oil production. HPLC was used to analyse phenolic compounds and tocopherols in Picual olive oils obtained during two successive crop seasons (1999/2000 and 2000/2001) and from different geographic areas of the Jaén province, which is located in the south of Spain. Oils obtained at the beginning of each season had a higher content of each phenolic compound than those obtained at the end, although this effect was more pronounced for orthodiphenols than for non-orthodiphenols. The main phenolic compound detected in this monovarietal oil was the aglycon of oleuropein followed by the other secoiridoid aglycons. Lignan concentration in oil showed low variability with season and harvesting time, and pinoresinol in particular was present at a concentration of about 40 ppm. Therefore, the total polyphenol content of this monovarietal oil ranged from 300 to 700 ppm. Similarly, significant differences in these compounds were not detected between geographic areas. This monovarietal oil is very stable due to its high content of oleic acid and for this reason, the storage of oils for 2 years in amber glass bottles caused only a 30% decrease in phenolic compounds. An increase was found in simple phenols such as hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol liberated from the acid hydrolysis of the secoiridoid aglycons, and minor losses in tocopherols were also observed. These data provide a basis for the evaluation of polyphenol intake from virgin olive oil consumption, particularly from the monovarietal olive oil most consumed in the world.",1
"Dry beans are rich sources of dietary fiber and phytochemicals such as flavonoids and phenolics. In the current study, we determined the effects of two processing methods (soaking and toasting) on total phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidin and antioxidant potential by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity and ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) in selected dry beans (red kidney beans (K), black-eyed peas (B), pinto beans (P) and soy beans (S)). Total phenolics (mg/g dwb) expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE), total flavonoids (mg/g dwb) as catechin equivalents (CE) and proanthocyanidin expressed as leucocyanidin equivalent (mg LE/g) ranged from 3.42 to 7.21, 0.61 to 0.84 and 0.51 to 3.13 in raw beans; 3.58 to 6.94, 0.19 to 0.99 and 0.43 to 3.13 in soaked beans and 4.55 to 9.52, 0.23 to1.00 and 0.20 to 3.25 in toasted beans, respectively. FRAP (μg/g) in raw, soaked and toasted dry beans ranged from 0.00097 to 0.00424 while DPPH(T30) (%) ranged from 43.9 to 62.61. Our results indicate that processing methods (soaking and roasting) influenced total phenolic, flavonoid and antioxidant contents (DPPH, FRAP) in selected dry beans.",1
"Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-asparaginase (pegaspargase) is a key agent in chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but recipients frequently experience allergic reactions. We hypothesized that by decreasing antibody-producing CD20-positive B cells, rituximab may reduce these reactions. Children and adolescents (aged 1-18 years) with newly diagnosed B-ALL treated on the St. Jude Total XVII study were randomized to induction therapy with or without rituximab on day 3 (cohort 1) or on days 6 and 24 (cohort 2). Patient clinical demographics, CD20 expression, minimal residual disease (MRD), rituximab reactions, pegaspargase allergy, anti-pegaspargase antibodies, and pancreatitis were evaluated. Thirty-five patients received rituximab and 37 did not. Among the 35 recipients, 16 (45.7%) experienced a grade 2 or higher reaction to rituximab. There were no differences between recipients and non-recipients in the incidence of pegaspargase reactions (P  >  0.999), anti-pegaspargase antibodies (P  =  0.327), or pancreatitis (P  =  0.480). CD20 expression on day 8 was significantly lower in rituximab recipients (P  <  0.001), but there were no differences in MRD levels on day 8, 15, or at the end of induction. Rituximab administration during induction in pediatric patients with B-ALL was associated with a high incidence of infusion reactions with no significant decrease in pegaspargase allergies, anti-pegaspargase antibodies, or MRD.",0
"Despite significant progress in the prognosis of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in recent decades, a notable portion of children still confronts challenges such as treatment resistance and recurrence, leading to limited options and a poor prognosis. LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) has been confirmed to exert a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. In our research, we aim to elucidate the underlying function and mechanisms of LDB1 within the background of T-ALL. Employing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) techniques, we delineated the functional impact of LDB1 in T-ALL cell lines. Through the application of RNA-Seq, CUT&Tag, and immunoprecipitation assays, we scrutinized master transcription factors cooperating with LDB1 and identified downstream targets under LDB1 regulation. LDB1 emerges as a critical transcription factor co-activator in cell lines derived from T-ALL. It primarily collaborates with master transcription factors (ERG, ETV6, IRF1) to cooperatively regulate the transcription of downstream target genes. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments affirm the essential fuction of LDB1 in the proliferation and survival of cell lines derived from T-ALL, with MYB identified as a significant downstream target of LDB1. To sum up, our research establishes the pivotal fuction of LDB1 in the tumorigenesis and progression of T-ALL cell lines. Mechanistic insights reveal that LDB1 cooperates with ERG, ETV6, and IRF1 to modulate the expression of downstream effector genes. Furthermore, LDB1 controls MYB through remote enhancer modulation, providing valuable mechanistic insights into its involvement in the progression of T-ALL.",0
"The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved survival rates among patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Ph-like B-ALL patients lack the BCR::ABL1 translocation but share gene expression profiles with Ph+ B-ALL. The role of TKIs for Ph-like patients pre- and post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is not yet clear. Here we present five cases of pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients who presented with Ph-like B-ALL or CML in B-ALL blast phase who were treated with personalized TKI regimens pre- and post-HSCT. This report describes several novel Ph-like fusions as well as combinations of TKIs with chemotherapy or immunotherapy not yet reported in the pediatric population. This case series provides real-world experience highlighting the potential application of pre- and post-HSCT use of TKIs in a subset of patients with targetable fusions.",0
"Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate (5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol (10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol (19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- (14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4, and 11, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction.",1
"Enhancer reprogramming plays a significant role in the heterogeneity of cancer. However, we have limited knowledge about the impact of chromatin remodeling in B-Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients, and how it affects tumorigenesis and drug response. Our research focuses on investigating the role of enhancers in sustaining oncogenic transformation in children with BCP-ALL. We used ATAC-seq to study the accessibility of chromatin in pediatric BCP-ALL at three different stages-onset, remission, and relapse. Using a combination of computational and experimental methods, we were able to analyze the accessibility landscape and focus on the most significant cis-regulatory sites. These sites were then functionally validated through the use of Promoter capture Hi-C in a primary cell line model called LAL-B, followed by RNA-seq and genomic deletion of target sites using CRISPR-Cas9 editing. We found that enhancer activity changes during cancer progression and is mediated by the production of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). CRISPR-Cas9-mediated validation of previously unknown eRNA productive enhancers demonstrated their capability to control the oncogenic activities of the MYB and DCTD genes. Our findings directly support the notion that productive enhancer engagement is a crucial determinant of the BCP-ALL and highlight the potential of enhancers as therapeutic targets in pediatric BCP-ALL.",0

"To determine the prevalence of iron overload in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after treatment cessation and establish a cutoff value for serum ferritin level as an indicator of iron overload. Early detection and monitoring of iron overload in patients with leukemia is crucial. In this prospective cohort study, 66 pediatric patients with ALL who were treated at a tertiary referral center affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in Shiraz, Southern Iran, were investigated from July 2020 to December 2022. Serum ferritin levels were measured 6 months after treatment completion. T2* magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and heart was done for all patients. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to illustrate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to assess the diagnostic value of serum ferritin level and total transfusion volume. A total of 24 patients (36.4%) had iron overload in the heart or liver based on T2 magnetic resonance imaging findings. Serum ferritin level was a highly accurate diagnostic marker for iron overload in pediatric patients with ALL, with a sensitivity of 95.8%, and specificity of 85.7% for a cutoff value of 238.5 ng/mL. Also, blood transfusion was a good predictor of iron overload a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 81% for a cutoff value of 28.3 mL/kg. We identified specific cutoff values for serum ferritin and blood transfusion volume to predict iron overload with high sensitivity and specificity. These markers offer a cost-effective and accessible approach for periodic screening of iron deposition, particularly in resource-constrained settings.",0
"A simple HPLC method is reported for fast separation and determination of phenolic compounds (tyrosol, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and oleuropeina) and phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) in virgin olive oil samples. The samples were diluted with 2-propanol and injected into the column directly without previous extraction. Samples with an olive oil content of up to 65% were injected without any problems. The analytes were separated on a C-18 column by a micellar mobile phase containing 0.07M SDS and 2.5% 2-propanol at pH 3, and were detected at 210nm. Linear calibration curves [r2>0.997] were obtained with detection limits ranging from 0.052 to 0.16μg/g and 1 to 8.6% repeatability for the phenolic compounds. Several virgin olive oil samples were analysed and the recovery values were around 110%.",1

"A sensitive, rapid, efficient, and reliable method for the separation and determination of phenolic acids by capillary zone electrophoresis has been carried out. A detailed method optimization was carried out to separate 14 different compounds by studying parameters such as pH, type and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and injection time. The separation was performed within 16 min, using a 25 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6) at 25 kV with 8 s of hydrodynamic injection. With this method and using a liquid-liquid extraction system, with recovery values around 95%, it has been possible to detect small quantities of phenolic acids in olive oil samples. This is apparently the first paper showing the quantification of this specific family of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil samples.",1
"Phytoestrogens are a group of non-steroidal secondary plant metabolites with structural and functional similarity to 17β-oestradiol. Urinary and plasma phytoestrogens have been used as biomarkers for dietary intake, however, this is often not possible in large epidemiological studies or to assess general exposure in free-living individuals. Accurate information about dietary phytoestrogens is therefore important but there is very limited data concerning food contents. In this study, we analysed the phytoestrogen (isoflavone, lignan and coumestrol) content in more than 240 different foods based on fresh and processed fruits and vegetables using a newly developed sensitive method based on LC–MS incorporating 13C3-labelled standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analysed with a median content of 20μg/100g wet weight (isoflavones: 2μg/100g; lignans 12μg/100g). Most foods contained less than 100μg/100g, however, 5% of foods analysed contained more than 400μg/100g, in particular soya-based foods and other legumes. The results published here will contribute to databases of dietary phytoestrogen content and allow the more accurate determination of phytoestrogen exposure in free-living individuals.",1
"The flavonoid composition of immature leaves of pak choi [Brassica rapa L. ssp. chinensis L. (Hanelt.)] was investigated. Flavonol aglycone content was measured in 11 pak choi varieties, indicating significant differences (P < 0.05) in content between varieties and relatively high contents of kaempferol and isorhamnetin. Levels of quercetin ranged from 3.2 to 6.1 mg/100 g of dry weight (DW), whereas levels of isorhamnetin and kaempferol were significantly higher (8.1-35.1 and 36.0-102.6 mg/100 g of DW, respectively). A large number of glycoside and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin were identified in cv. 'Shanghai' by LC/UV-DAD/ESI-MS/MS. The UV-DAD data allowed identification of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but detailed MS/MS fragmentations were required for the structure elucidation. Pak choi could be a potentially important source of dietary flavonols, in particular, kaempferol and isorhamnetin.",1
"This study investigated the prognostic significance of m6A-related programmed cell death (PCD) genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Transcriptomic data from the TCGA-ALL and GSE48558 datasets were analyzed to identify m6A-related PCD genes (corgenes), which were then intersected with 3,063 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), resulting in 23 candidate genes. Univariate Cox regression and LASSO regression analyses identified CFLAR and CDK4 as key prognostic genes, facilitating the construction of a high-accuracy risk prediction model. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant pathway differences between the high-risk group (HRG) and the low-risk group (LRG), including olfactory transduction, circadian rhythm, and protein export (adj.P < 0.05). Sensitivity analysis of 60 chemotherapy agents indicated that Bicalutamide was more effective in LRG, while ATRA, CCT018159, PHA-665752, and PLX4720 demonstrated greater efficacy in HRG. RT-qPCR validation confirmed upregulation of CDK4 and downregulation of CFLAR in ALL samples (P < 0.05). This study offers important theoretical support for the prognostic evaluation and personalized treatment strategies in ALL.",0
"The Spanish enhanced recovery in adult surgery strategy, the ""RICA pathway"", was published in 2021 and includes 19 specific recommendations and more than 20 indirect recommendations for patient blood management (PBM). After reviewing these recommendations, and in the context of the new clinical evidence available, we propose the following updates: First: Detection and treatment of any preoperative anemia status in ALL patients who are candidates for major surgery with hematinic deficiencies. Second: Universal use of tranexamic acid in major surgery, bedside monitoring of intraoperative hemoglobin levels, restrictive transfusion criteria, and monitoring of patient well-being in terms of hydration, coagulability, normothermia and analgesia. Third: Restrictive transfusion criteria, single-unit blood transfusion and diagnosis/treatment of postoperative anemia. Real, universal implementation and integration of PBM in the RICA program is urgently needed.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy and among the most common malignancies in young adults and requires a unique pattern of healthcare utilization including an acute/emergent presentation and an intensive initial 8 months of therapy followed by two years of outpatient treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic caused massive global disruptions in healthcare use and delivery. This report aims to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation, diagnosis and continued management of childhood and young adult ALL in regard to utilization and cost of care among commercially insured individuals in the United States. Utilizing a commercial insurance claims database, 529 pediatric and young adult patients were identified who were diagnosed with ALL between January 2016 and March 2021. New diagnoses were evaluated by era and demographics. Utilization was measured by COVID-related era as number of inpatient and outpatient encounters, inpatient days, and cumulative cost during the initial 8 months of therapy. None of these cost or utilization factors changed significantly during or shortly after the pandemic. These findings reinforce that the necessary care for pediatric and young adult ALL was unwavering despite the massive shifts in the healthcare system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This provides a valuable benchmark as we further examine the factors that influence the pandemic's impact on health equity and access to care, especially in vulnerable pediatric and young adult populations. This is the first investigation of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on utilization and cost of care in pediatric and young adult cancer.",0
"Seed samples of seventeen field pea cultivars grown at five locations, and nine grass pea lines grown at two locations, in western Canada during 1993 and 1994 were analysed for total phenolics and condensed tannins. Each location in each year was considered as one environment. Total phenolics in field pea differed significantly among cultivars, ranging from 162 mg/kg DM (dry matter) (CE, catechin equivalents) for AC Tamor to 325 mg/kg DM (CE) for Richmond. Field pea had barely detectable levels of condensed tannins. Total phenolics in grass pea ranged from 868 mg/kg DM (CE) for L880388 to 2059 mg/kg DM (CE) for LS89110. Condensed tannins in grass pea ranged from 0.89 g/kg DM (CE) for L880388 to 5.18 g/kg DM (CE) for LS89125. Cultivar had a larger relative contribution to total phenolic levels in field pea and to total phenolic and condensed tannin levels in grass pea than environment. Total phenolic and condensed tannin levels were not correlated with seed yield and seed protein content in field pea or grass pea. Levels of total phenolics and condensed tannins were positively correlated in grass pea. Grass pea seeds with darker seed coat colour contained higher levels of condensed tannins.",1
"The experimental conditions commonly used to detect bound phenolic acids by alkaline hydrolysis result in loss of several phenolic acids, particularly dihydroxy-derivatives (caffeic acid, dihydrocaffeic acid, homogentisic acid). In this study we show that the addition of ascorbic acid, a strong antioxidant, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, a metal chelator, totally prevent the loss of phenolic acids during alkaline hydrolysis. In these conditions, a complete recovery of caffeic acid following hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid (5′-caffeoylquinic acid, an ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid) was found. This procedure has been successfully applied to quantitatively detect bound phenolic acids in coffee brew and apple.",1
"A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.",1
"A method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis of nine chlorogenic acids (CGAs), three isomers each of caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), feruloylquinic acids (FQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (dCQAs), and their two metabolites, caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA), in human plasma. In simultaneous multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) measurements using ESI-MS/MS with a negative ion mode, a deprotonated molecular ion derived from each of the 11 molecules was used as a precursor ion while three diagnostic product ions characteristic for each were selected for the qualitative analysis. To obtain maximal intensities for all diagnostic product ions, the collision energy was optimized for each one. LC separation was achieved under conditions of a reversed-phase Inertsil ODS-2 column combined with a gradient elution system using 50mM acetic acid with 3% acetonitrile aqueous solution and 50mM acetic acid with 100% acetonitrile. In the quantitative analysis, one of the three diagnostic product ions for each of the 11 molecules was selected. Application of simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS MRM measurements to analyze the 11 standards spiked into blank human plasma indicated that all diagnostic product ions were detected without any interference, and that the sensitivity, linearity and recovery of this method were acceptable. When using this method to analyze those 11 molecules in the plasma after oral ingestion of 250ml of a drink containing a green coffee bean extract (300mg CGAs), all 11 molecules were identified and CQAs, FQAs and FA were quantified. CQAs, FQAs and dCQAs in human plasma were detected for the first time. This method should be useful to understand the biological and pharmacological effects of CGAs, such as improvement of human hypertension.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) have demonstrated curative potential for hematological malignancies, but the optimal manufacturing has not yet been determined and may differ across products. The first step, T cell selection, removes contaminating cell types that can potentially suppress T cell expansion and transduction. While positive selection of CD4/CD8 T cells after leukapheresis is often used in clinical trials, it may modulate signaling cascades downstream of these co-receptors; indeed, the addition of a CD4/CD8-positive selection step altered CD22 CART potency and toxicity in patients. While negative selection may avoid this drawback, it is virtually absent from good manufacturing practices. Here, we performed both CD4/CD8-positive and -negative clinical scale selections of mononuclear cell apheresis products and generated CD22 CARTs per our ongoing clinical trial (NCT02315612NCT02315612). While the selection process did not yield differences in CART expansion or transduction, positively selected CART exhibited a significantly higher",0
"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a promising treatment option for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Co-infusion of umbilical cord blood (UCB) in haploidentical cell transplantation (haplo HCT) (haplo-cord HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a promising treatment in previous studies, but the clinical outcomes of T-ALL patients with haplo HCT whether combined with UCB remain unclear. Between 2012 and 2022, a total of 281 T-ALL patients including 190 with UCB (haplo-cord HCT group) and 91 without UCB (haplo HCT group) in 4 centers were retrospectively analyzed. No differences were observed in neutrophil or platelet reconstitution or transplantation-related complications including cumulative incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD. In the haplo-cord HCT group, there was a greater absolute count of CD3-CD16+CD56+ cells at +1 month (P = .003) and +3 months (P < .001) and a greater absolute count of CD3+ cells at +9 months (P = .025) and +1 year (P = .004); and the incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia was lower in the haplo-cord HCT group (P < .002). Compared with the haplo HCT group, the haplo-cord HCT group exhibited better 2-year prognosis (OS: 72.7% versus 61.0%, P = .008; DFS: 67.0% versus 49.6%, P = .001; CIR: 23.9% versus 36.8%, P = .048) and similar NRM (12.0% versus 21.3%, P = .061). Subgroup analyses suggested that patients who were adolescents/young adults (P = .016), exhibited a non-early T-cell precursor (P = .001), required ≥2 courses of induction chemotherapy to achieve complete remission (CR) (P < .001) and were at CR1 status at transplantation (P = .005) could benefit from haplo-cord HCT for survival. Multivariate analyses revealed that haplo-cord HCT independently improved the OS (P = .004) and DFS (P < .001) of T-ALL patients. In conclusion, haplo-cord HCT may represent an optimal treatment strategy for T-ALL patients.",0
"While the event-free survival (EFS) of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has improved greatly in the last decades, the EFS for patients diagnosed with ALL before the age of one is still under 50%. This outcome further decreases when infants have a rearrangement in the gene encoding histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A), whose EFS is under 40%. To improve the EFS of infants treated for ALL, it is crucial to implement optimal dosing guidelines tailored to this population. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of chemotherapeutics in infants is complex due to rapid physiological development in the first year of life. Current dosing guidelines are often extrapolated from paediatric or adult standards using body surface area or age-based adjustments. This may not adequately account for the unique PK-characteristics of infants since developmental changes will influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of chemotherapeutics. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of how developmental changes could affect the PK of chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of ALL. Key factors we evaluated are renal maturation, body composition, blood composition and ontogeny of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Understanding the influence of developmental processes taking place in the first year of life on the PK of chemotherapeutics will aid the eventual application of evidence-based dosing guidelines tailored specifically to infants treated for ALL, making it possible to determine more appropriate starting doses for each stage of development. These tailored dosing guidelines will enhance the precision and safety of chemotherapy in this vulnerable population.",0
"This research is focused on the antioxidant properties of dietary components, in particular phenolics and carotenoids and the assessment of the contribution of the combined antioxidants to the total antioxidant activity (TAA) of tomato fruit. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of processing on the antioxidant properties of tomato. The effects of three different methods of processing fresh tomatoes into tomato sauce were investigated with respect to the antioxidant properties of the fruit. Identification and quantification of the main carotenoids and flavonoids present in tomatoes was achieved by HPLC analysis and the effect on the concentration and availability of these compounds was investigated at different stages of the processing. The processing affected mainly naringenin causing a reduction in the concentration. Conversely, levels of chlorogenic acid were increased suggesting an improvement in availability of this compound to extraction. The concentration of all-trans-lycopene was also increased following processing. Less than 10% isomerisation of all-trans-lycopene to the cis form was detected for all the methods analysed. The effects of processing on the overall antioxidant activity support the theory of a general improvement in availability of individual antioxidants. For both hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts TAA values were increased.",1
"Antibody-based and cell-based novel immunotherapies, such as bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE), antibody-drug conjugates, or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are currently standard treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To date, CD20-targeting monoclonal antibodies and the CD19-targeting BiTE's blinatumomab have been established elements of frontline therapy, either in patients with CD20+ ALL or in patients with measurable disease (MRD) following conventional chemotherapy. Recently, blinatumomab has also demonstrated a survival benefit in patients with MRD-negative ALL. Based on the observed high response rates and improved survival outcomes in patients with R/R ALL, antibody-based immunotherapies are being prospectively studied in the upfront setting, particularly in older adult patients, where even age-adapted conventional chemotherapies are still associated with significant rates of early death, treatment-related toxicity, and poor prognosis. In these approaches, conventional chemotherapy has been replaced or reduced and supplemented by immunotherapeutic agents, resulting in promising outcomes that form the basis for evaluating and defining new treatment standards.",0
"Four different colored carrots, orange, purple with orange core, yellow, and white, were examined for their content of phenolics, antioxidant vitamins, and sugars as well as their volatiles and sensory responses. A total of 35 volatiles were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.",1

"To evaluate the NEXUS Chest CT ALL decision instrument (DI) in reducing unnecessary chest CT imaging in minor blunt trauma patients while preserving high sensitivity for detecting clinically meaningful injuries. Additionally, we examined the impact of delayed presentation, chronic disease, and anticoagulation/anti-aggregation medications on trauma outcomes. This retrospective study included 853 adult minor blunt trauma patients who underwent chest CT in the emergency department (ED) of Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center between 2018 and 2022. Clinically meaningful outcomes were defined as trauma-related interventions or hospital admissions. The NEXUS Chest CT DI criteria, along with three additional criteria, were analyzed using logistic regression to identify independent predictors for the primary outcome. These predictors formed a modified DI, and its performance was compared to the original NEXUS DI. Among 853 patients (median age 44.5 years, 64.2% male), 230 (27.0%) had trauma-related chest CT findings, and 64 (7.5%) experienced clinically meaningful outcomes. Independent predictors included abnormal chest X-ray (aOR 6.5, p < 0.001), chronic disease (aOR 5.2, p < 0.001), sternal tenderness (aOR 4.7, p = 0.007), rapid deceleration (aOR 3.7, p < 0.001), and chest wall tenderness (aOR 3.1, p < 0.001). The NEXUS DI achieved 92.1% sensitivity, reducing imaging by 41.3%, while the modified DI increased sensitivity to 98.4% with a 34.3% imaging reduction. The NEXUS Chest CT ALL DI significantly reduces unnecessary imaging while maintaining high diagnostic precision. A modified version enhances sensitivity, refining decision-making in emergency care. Integrating such decision tools, particularly in cases of minor trauma, is highly recommended to optimize resource use and improve patient outcomes.",0
Direct thiolysis of crude plant materials and HPLC analysis of the reaction media were used to quantify and to characterise procyanidins (condensed tanins) and other main polyphenols of three dessert apple varieties. Results showed evidence of the large predominance of the procyanidin class in the polyphenolic composition of dessert apple skin and flesh. The structure of procyanidins was wholly homogeneous with (-)-epicatechin representing more than 95% of the constitutive flavan-3-ol units and with average degrees of polymerisation in the 5–7 range.,1
"The spectrophotometric characteristics of chemicals used as equivalents in Folin–Ciocalteu method were evaluated. Gallic acid and (+)-catechin showed the highest response at the range of 20–100 mg/L, followed by tannic acid, and then chlorogenic acid which exhibited relatively very low absorbance. Chlorogenic acid and neochlorogenic acid showed the lower absorbance than gallic acid by 0.6 times, and it might result in underestimation of the real total phenolic content of chlorogenic acid-rich samples. Chlorogenic acid and neochlorogenic acid exhibited nearly the same spectra in a broad absorbance range, and chlorogenic acid could be appropriate for an equivalent chemical instead of neochlorogenic acid, which has been proved as a major phenolic compound in plums. The average total phenolics in 13 plum cultivars expressed by chlorogenic acid equivalent was 678.2 mg/100 g, whereas it was 368.7 mg/100 g as gallic acid equivalent. Overall, chlorogenic acid as an equivalent chemical is recommended to determine the total phenolic content of chlorogenic acid-rich plums to predict more accurate total phenolic content.",1
"The treatment outcomes for adult Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved with the introduction of pediatric protocols. On assessing long-term survivors of chemotherapy who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), it was found that these patients had good performance status and few complications. Therefore, in the first complete remission (1CR) of ALL, allo-HSCT is indicated for patients in whom the results of chemotherapy are predicted to be poor. In adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with ALL, allo-HSCT is recommended in the 1CR if end of consolidation measurable residual disease (MRD) is positive. In adults with ALL (non-AYA patients), if end of induction MRD is negative, chemotherapy should be continued and allo-HSCT is not recommended. In the future, it is necessary to perform a comprehensive evaluation of individual patients that considers MRD, as well as the initial tumor burden and biological features of leukemic cells.",0
"Infants with mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia are usually refractory to standard induction therapy and are not immediate candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Chromosome 11q23 translocations, resulting in MLL rearrangement, have been well characterized in infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). While t(4;11) ALL continues to have carry a bleak prognosis, patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) have a shorter median overall survival than those compared with de novo MDS. We describe a child with t-MDS who evolved from MLL-rearranged ALL and was successfully treated with HSCT without toxic preconditioning. MDS diagnosis was based on morphological characteristics of bone marrow dysplasia in patients with clinical manifestations evidence of hematopoiesis impairments by different combinations of anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Although the best donor for allo-HSCT is generally considered an human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling, only ~ 30% of patients have a suitable sibling. HSCT from an unrelated donor is a suitable option for patients with t-MDS who do not have matched sibling donors. Allo-HSCT without recipient preconditioning could be a promising treatment option for t-MDS, especially for patients with recurrent or persistent infections. Cytogenetics, prognosis, and treatment of t-MDS are briefly discussed. Preconditioning before allo-HSCT seriously damages immune function. This work reviews our experience with a patient with t-MDS following ALL complicated by recurrent infections, and highlights our choice to omit preconditioning from allo-HSCT.",0
"An automated on-line method for the determination of the isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, was developed using in-tube solid-phase microextraction coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (in-tube SPME-HPLC). In-tube SPME is a new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were above 97%.",1
Polyphenols have been isolated from beer using chromatography on Sephadex LH20 followed by organic solvent extraction. The polyphenols were subsequently assayed by high performance liquid chromatography which showed the isolation procedure to be quantitative for the types of polyphenols present in beer. Batch to batch variation of polyphenol contents in single beer types has been found.,1
"Cross-sectional radioanatomic study. To determine the feasibility of performing an anterior column realignment (ACR) using an anterior-to-psoas (ATP) approach at L1-L5. Axial magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the L1-L5 disc levels obtained at a single institution were obtained and analyzed. The feasibility of performing an ACR was assessed using a combination of the size of the left oblique corridor (OC), the psoas morphology using the modified Moro classification, and the anterior disc edge to great vessel distance. Three hundred MRI studies obtained from 300 patients were included. All patients had a measurable left OC at the L1-L4 levels. Twenty patients (6.7%) had no measurable OC at the L4-L5 level. According to the modified Moro's classification, a high-rising psoas was seen in 4 patients (1.3%) at the L3-L4 level and 57 patients (19.0%) at the L4-L5 level. An ALL release was considered high risk due to no measurable space between the anterior disc edge and the great vessels in 54 patients (18.0%) at the L1-L2 level, 39 patients (13.0%) at the L2-L3 level, 119 patients (39.7%) at the L3-L4 level, and 226 patients (75.3%) at the L4-L5 level. ACR using an ATP approach is the most radioanatomically feasible at L2-L3. The L4-L5 level has the highest risk with regards to both the ATP approach and the ALL release for an ACR due to high rates of unmeasurable left OC and space between the anterior disc edge and the great vessels.",0
"Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a rare and aggressive type of acute leukemia. The Philadelphia chromosome is the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The differentiation between Ph+ T-ALL and T-cell lymphoblastic crisis of CML may be problematic in some cases. Here, we report a rare case of de novo Ph+ T-ALL that presented a diagnostic challenge. The overall clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and xenotransplantation results suggest a diagnosis of Ph+ T-ALL. The patient was treated with induction chemotherapy including imatinib followed by haploidentical stem cell transplantation and achieved complete remission.",0
"Intensified postinduction therapy improves outcomes for high-risk pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in high-income countries. However, benefits are uncertain in middle-income countries where supportive care is often limited. The primary objective was to determine if augmented protocal I phase B (IB) reduced the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse compared with standard IB among newly diagnosed pediatric patients with intermediate- and high-risk (IR and HR) ALL in a middle-income country. This was a randomized, phase III multicenter study conducted in 30 centers from GATLA group in Argentina, as part of International BFM study group ALLIC. We included newly diagnosed pediatric patients with ALL 1-18 years of age with IR or HR B- and T-precursor ALL. Only patients who were in complete remission at end induction were randomized to augmented IB versus standard IB. Augmented IB consisted of cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine, vincristine, E. coli l-asparaginase and intrathecal methotrexate. Standard IB consisted of cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, cytarabine, and intrathecal methotrexate. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of relapse. There were 1060 patients randomized to standard IB (n = 527) and augmented IB (n = 533). The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (±standard error) was not significantly different by group (22.6 ± 0.2 vs. 22.3 ± 0.1%; p = 0.97) for standard IB and augmented IB, respectively. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was 6.5 ± 0.1 and 7.5 ± 0.1%; p = 0.45, respectively. Among newly diagnosed pediatric patients with IR and HR ALL treated in Argentina, postinduction intensification with augmented IB did not improve outcomes compared with standard IB. Standard IB should be used for these patients. Future trials should focus on reducing TRM.",0
"Pityriasis amiantacea (PA) is a rare presentation characterized by the presence of extensive adherent scaling that tightly encircles and affixes tufts of hairs secondary to inflammatory or infectious dermatoses. However, the occurrence of PA as a consequence of leukaemia cutis has not been previously reported. A 32-year-old man with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) presented with severe scalp scaling and hair loss for 2 months. Examination revealed extensive, tightly adherent scales encircling and binding down hairs, along with haemorrhagic crusts. Skin examination showed nontender, partially blanchable papules forming ill-defined plaques, giving a cobblestone appearance. Trichoscopy revealed white crusts, tufting, and micro-haemorrhages. Scalp biopsy confirmed precursor B-ALL infiltration. He was diagnosed with PA with secondary cutis verticis gyrata due to leukaemia cutis and referred to a haemato-oncologist for further management. Leukaemia cutis is a rare condition where leukaemia cells infiltrate the skin, often associated with acute myeloid leukaemia and ALL. It can lead to secondary verticis gyrata. The co-occurrence of PA and cutis verticis gyrata is rare and previously unreported, highlighting the need for increased awareness among clinicians.",0
"A simple procedure for determination of trans-resveratrol in wines from Alentejo region delimited appellation (Portugal) is described and validated. A set of 47 red and 21 white wines was analysed by direct injection in high performance liquid Chromatograph with UV detector. A detection limit of 0.06 mg/L was achieved. Global uncertainty associated with the results, according to EURACHEM/CITAC rules, ranged from 16.33 to 27.15 %. Trans-resveratrol was detected in all red wines and in 8 white wines. The amount was consistently higher in the red wines (up to 2.64 mg/L), when compared to the white wines (never exceeding 0.19 mg/L).",1
"The growing population of older adults living with HIV presents unique challenges for long-term care facilities, which are increasingly tasked with supporting residents who require both HIV-specific and geriatric care. Despite advances in HIV treatment that have extended life expectancy, the needs of these individuals in long-term care remain underexplored, and the field lacks a consolidated understanding of how facilities are currently equipped to manage these complexities. This scoping review protocol outlines the approach for synthesizing existing evidence on the experiences, challenges, and care outcomes of aging with HIV in long-term care settings. To examine the state of evidence on older adults with HIV in long-term care, providing an overview of current knowledge on the health, social, and systemic factors influencing their care and identifying gaps that may guide future research and practice. The team includes knowledge users, including experts by experience, to ensure the findings are grounded in lived realities and practical applicability. Using a scoping review framework by the Joanna Briggs Institute, we will conduct a comprehensive search of literature from inception in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (R) ALL (Ovid), Embase Classic + Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), CINAHL Ultimate (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), AgeLine (EBSCO), and Scopus to capture studies that address aging with HIV in long-term care settings. Eligible studies will be screened and selected based on criteria focused on relevance to the intersection of aging, HIV, and long-term care. Articles will be screened by two reviewers. Data will be charted and synthesized thematically, allowing for an organized summary of findings on key topics such as physical and mental health, care provision, and facility preparedness. This review will offer an overview of the current state of knowledge on aging with HIV in long-term care facilities, highlighting what is known about care practices, health outcomes, and systemic challenges in these settings. Findings will clarify the breadth and depth of existing evidence and reveal areas requiring further research, thereby informing policy and enhancing care strategies for this population.",0
"(-)-epicatechin is one of the most potent antioxidants present in the human diet. Particularly high levels are found in black tea, apples, and chocolate. High intake of catechins has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. There have been several reports concerning the bioavailability of catechins, however, the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in blood, tissues, and urine remains unclear. In the present study, we purified and elucidated the chemical structure of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in human and rat urine after oral administration. Three metabolites were purified from human urine including (-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-3'-O-glucuronide, and 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-5 or 7-O-glucuronide, according to 1H- and 13C-NMR, HMBC, and LC-MS analyses. The metabolites purified from rat urine were 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide, and 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin-7-O-glucuronide. These compounds were also detected in the blood of humans and rats by LC-MS. The presence of these metabolites in blood and urine suggests that catechins are metabolized and circulated in the body after administration of catechin-containing foods.",1
"To analyze 43 leukemia genes in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Yunnan province, and provide the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of children with ALL in this area. The clinical data of 428 children with newly diagnosed ALL in Yunnan area from January 2015 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Multiple nested PCR technology was used to detect 43 common leukemia genes. Among the 428 children with ALL, 159 were positive for leukemia genes, with a positive rate of 37.15% (159/428), and a total of 15 leukemia genes were detected. Among the 159 leukemia gene-positive children, The most common fusion gene of children with ALL in Yunnan is 云南地区儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病基因类型分析. 通过分析云南地区428例急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）患儿43种白血病基因，为本地区ALL患儿的诊疗提供依据。. 回顾性分析2015年1月-2020年12月云南地区428例初诊ALL患儿的临床资料，应用多重巢式PCR技术检测43种常见的白血病基因。. 428例ALL患儿中白血病基因阳性159例，阳性率为37.15%（159/ 428），共检出15种白血病基因。159例白血病基因阳性患儿中， 云南地区ALL患儿常见的融合基因以",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) are uncommon, highly aggressive diseases originating either from immature precursor T cells or from mature B cells in BL. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of an early autologous and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) concept in 28 patients with advanced stage T-ALL/LBL and BL after three to four remission induction/consolidation chemotherapy cycles. Considering only patients in first complete remission (CR), the 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) was 91% in patients with BL and 73% in patients with T-ALL/LBL with a 5-year relapse incidence (RI) of 9% in patients with BL and 27% in patients with T-ALL/LBL. All relapsing patients finally succumbed to the disease (n = 10) or complications/toxicity after having received a salvage allogeneic transplant (n = 5). Despite the low patient number our retrospective single-centre analysis by incorporating an early intensive high-dose chemo-/radiotherapy strategy with either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation, although preliminary, show promising long-term outcome. Further studies are highly warranted to better define those patients who might benefit most from such a treatment approach.",0
"Human diet contains weakly estrogenic compounds such as daidzein (DAI) and genistein (GEN), phytoestrogens present in soy and many vegetables as well as bisphenol A (BPA), a contaminant from packing materials and plastic containers for foods and beverages. In light of concerns about hormonally active agents, biomonitoring methods are needed to assess human exposure to such compounds. A method for simultaneous determination of DAI, its metabolite equol (EQ), GEN, and BPA by GC-MS analysis was established, validated and applied to measure concentrations in human urine. Sample preparation involves enzymatic conjugate cleavage, SPE and derivatization by silylation. For GC/MS analysis, deuterated DAI and GEN and( 13)C-BPA are used as internal standards. LOD are 4, 4, 5 and 3 ng/mL urine for DAI, EQ, GEN and BPA, respectively. Interassay variations were 9% for DAI, 15% for EQ, 18% for GEN and 10% for BPA. Simple workup and accuracy of the method are suited for biomonitoring. An analysis of urine samples from 15 adults consuming typical German food revealed dietary exposure to phytoestrogens in all samples: GEN concentrations ranged between 13 and 238 ng/mL, those for DAI ranged from 12 to 356 ng/mL. More than half of the individuals excreted also the more estrogenic metabolite EQ, at levels of 8-128 ng/mL. Higher concentrations (GEN: 820, DAI: 960 and EQ: 1740 ng/mL) were measured in a 24 h urine sample upon ingestion of soy protein (50 g with 12.9 mg DAI and 25.2 mg GEN). Only urine collected after some days on strict phytoestrogen-free diet had undetectable isoflavone levels. BPA was detected in 9 of 15 urine samples ranging from 3 to 11 ng/mL, and at 55 ng/mL in one sample. In conclusion, a reliable method to determine BPA and isoflavones in urine was established and applied in a pilot study: Biomonitoring results show much higher dietary exposure to phytoestrogens than to BPA in German adults.",1
"There is an increasing interest in the biological and technological role of natural antioxidants present in green tea extracts. This is due to the inhibition of the oxidative process showed by tea catechins, which is higher than those of synthetic antioxidants (such as BHT) and other vegetal extracts (rosemary, oregano, grape seeds). In a first step of the work a rapid reversed phase HPLC method for the determination of catechins in green tea extracts, using a binary gradient system, was developed. Commercial green tea extracts were analyzed and the different catechins quantified. EGCG ((−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate) and EGC ((−)-epigallocatechin) were proposed as index of the antioxidant quality of tea extracts. Subsequentely, the previous chromatographic method was applied on a HPLC–MS system in order to verify the accuracy of some HPLC-DAD results and compare the two detection modes, on such a polyphenolic mixture. The use of mass spectrometry detection in quantification of catechins ensured an higher specificity of the method and a constant qualitative control of the identity of chromatographic peaks thanks to the concurrent acquisition of more than one mass signal (as M+1 and M+Na pseudomolecular peaks).",1
"The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions (Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better preserve the onion anthocyanins.",1
"The phenolic profile of strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch., Rosaceae) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. A peak displaying retention time and UV spectral data identical to those of phloridzin (phloretin 2'-O-beta-d-glucoside), a dihydrochalcone glucoside so far considered characteristic of apples, was monitored. For further characterization, crude extracts of strawberries were purified on polyamide, and the target compound was isolated by preparative and analytical HPLC. Structure elucidation was performed on the basis of APCI- and ESI-MS in the negative ion mode as well as by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy using authentic phloridzin for comparison. The d-configuration of the sugar moiety was established by HPLC analysis of the corresponding acyclic 1-deoxy-1-(N-acetyl-alpha-methylbenzylamino)alditol acetate. Apart from its chemotaxonomic relevance, this first report on the occurrence of phloridzin in strawberries is of particular interest for the authenticity control of strawberry products such as juices, jams, and fruit preparations since phloridzin has so far been used for the detection of fraudulent admixtures.",1
"After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' '-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate orally administered to the rat is proposed.",1
"The flavonoid fraction in saffron spice has been analysed, for the first time, by LC-DAD-MS/MS ESI and five kaempferol derivatives have been found. Compounds such as kaempferol-3-sophoroside, kaempferol-3-sophoroside-7-glucoside and kaempferol-3,7,4′-triglucoside were tentatively identified, whereas other compounds, such as kaempferol tetrahexoside and kaempferol-3-dihexoside were detected. Saffron samples from different geographical origins were clearly separated by their kaempferol 3-sophoroside contents that were able to explain 100% of the variance when a discriminant test was carried out.",1
"Pigment composition of 15 black carrot cultivars (Daucus carota ssp. sativus var. atrorubens Alef.) was screened by HPLC-MS. Up to seven cyanidin glycosides, five of which were acylated with hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids, were identified and quantified in the roots by HPLC-DAD. Contents of individual compounds indicated great differences in the potential of anthocyanin accumulation both between different cultivars and carrots of the same cultivar. Total anthocyanin amounts ranged from 45.4 mg/kg dry matter to 17.4 g/kg dry matter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the quantification of individual anthocyanins in roots of different black carrot cultivars. The determination of color properties in the extracts under various pH conditions proved black carrot anthocyanins to be applicable as natural food colorants also for low-acid food commodities, whereas a considerable loss of color was noted under nearly neutral conditions. Additionally, relatively high saccharide contents were found in almost all cultivars which may be disadvantageous when coloring concentrates are produced from carrot roots.",1
"Flaxseed has been used for centuries for oil extraction. In recent years it has attracted considerable interest as a result of studies which attribute potential health benefits to its components. Among the compounds that present biological activity, phenolic compounds are of special interest. The dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) reaches high concentrations in flaxseed. Flaxseed contains also other phenolic compounds, such as phenolic acids. Considering the importance of the phenolic fraction of flaxseed, high performance analytical methods have been developed to characterize its complex phenolic pattern. The understanding of the nature of these compounds is crucial for their possible exploitation in drugs and functional foods.",1
"Seventeen commonly consumed exotic fruits from Mauritius were analysed for their antioxidant capacity, total phenolics, proanthocyanidins, flavonoids and vitamin C content. Two independent methods were used to evaluate the antioxidant potential of total fruit extracts. The antioxidant activities of the fruits ranged from 1 to 47 µmol Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) g−1 fresh weight and from 0.3 to 34 micro/mol g fresh weight (FRAP) g−1 fresh weight. Total phenolics in the fruits ranged from 118 to 5638 µg g−1 fresh weight, proanthocyanidins from 7 to 2561 µg g−1 fresh weight, flavonoids from 21 to 712 µg g−1 fresh weight and vitamin C content from 8 to 1426 µg g−1 fresh weight. There were strong correlations between antioxidant activity (assessed by both TEAC and FRAP) and total phenolics and proanthocyanidins. Flavonoids seemed to contribute less to the antioxidant potential of the fruits, while very poor correlations were observed between ascorbate content and antioxidant activity. The highest antioxidant capacities were observed in red and yellow Psidium cattleianum Sabine ‘Chinese guava’, sweet and acid Averrhoa carambola L ‘starfruit’, Syzygium cumini L Skeels ‘jamblon’ and white Psidium guajava L ‘guava’. These fruits were also characterised by high levels of total phenolics. Mauritian exotic fruits are thus a significant source of phenolic antioxidants, which may have potential beneficial effects on health. Copyright © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry",1
"A combination of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells has made a breakthrough in refractory or relapsed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, it remains unclear if this treatment in newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL is associated with high rates of complete molecular remission (CMR) and leukemia-free survival. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dasatinib in combination with CAR T cells as frontline therapy in adults with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL. This trial was conducted at a single center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Patients were enrolled in this phase 2, single-arm nonrandomized clinical trial between March 5, 2021, and April 13, 2024. The data cutoff date was February 10, 2025. The data analysis was conducted on February 11, 2025. The median duration of follow-up was 23.9 (range, 7.3-47.7) months. A total of 29 adults with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL and adequate organ function were screened for eligibility, and 1 patient who received a diagnosis of blast-phase chronic myeloid leukemia was excluded. Dasatinib was administered with a 2-week vindesine and dexamethasone regimen as induction, followed by sequential CD19 and CD22 CAR T-cell therapies and single-agent dasatinib maintenance. The primary end point was CMR rate after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. CMR was defined as undetectable BCR/ABL1 transcripts as measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction with a sensitivity of 10-4 in the bone marrow. Twenty-eight patients (median [range] age, 48.5 [18.0-69.0] years; 10 female individuals [36%]) were enrolled, and 1 patient withdrew after induction. The CMR rate was 25% (7 of 28) after induction and increased to 85% (23 of 27) after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. Twenty-five patients (89.3%) received sequential CD22 CAR T-cell therapy, and the CMR rate was 76% (19 of 25). Of the 52 CAR T-cell therapies, only 21 cases of grade 1 cytokine release syndrome occurred. After a median follow-up of 23.9 (range, 7.3-47.7) months, the 2-year overall survival and leukemia-free survival were 92%. The results of this nonrandomized clinical trial suggest that the combination of dasatinib and CAR T-cell therapy showed encouraging efficacy in newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL with acceptable toxic effects. Further studies with larger cohorts and longer follow-up durations are needed. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04788472.",0
"Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.",1
"The Haematopoietically expressed homeobox transcription factor (Hhex) is a transcriptional repressor that is of fundamental importance across species, as evident by its evolutionary conservation spanning fish, amphibians, birds, mice and humans. Indeed, Hhex maintains its vital functions throughout the lifespan of the organism, beginning in the oocyte, through fundamental stages of embryogenesis in the foregut endoderm. The endodermal development driven by Hhex gives rise to endocrine organs such as the pancreas in a process which is likely linked to its role as a risk factor in diabetes and pancreatic disorders. Hhex is also required for the normal development of the bile duct and liver, the latter also importantly being the initial site of haematopoiesis. These haematopoietic origins are governed by Hhex, leading to its crucial later roles in definitive haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, lymphopoiesis and haematological malignancy. Hhex is also necessary for the developing forebrain and thyroid gland, with this reliance on Hhex evident in its role in endocrine disorders later in life including a potential role in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the roles of Hhex in embryological development throughout evolution appear to be linked to its later roles in a variety of disease processes.",0
"There is an unmet medical need for the treatment of elderly patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as only a minority of them achieves long-term survival with current anti-ALL chemotherapy. Here, the recent management of these patients is discussed, including current approaches and future directions, as novel agents developed for refractory/relapsed ALL are now being incorporated into front-line therapies with very promising results. The manuscript will sequentially consider Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative ALL, then Ph+ and finally T-ALL. Accordingly, novel strategies using chemo-free approaches and new drugs such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, blinatumomab, venetoclax, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and CAR T-cells will be discussed.",0
"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell are effective treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Various forms of intra- and extramedullary relapses have been reported after HSCT and CAR-T-cell therapy for ALL; however, no reports have investigated isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse after HSCT and CAR-T-cell therapy. Hence, no clinical treatment has been established for such rare patients. An 18-year-old male patient with B-cell ALL suffered from isolated CNS relapse after HSCT and CAR-T-cell therapy. Conventional systemic intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapies were ineffective and intolerable. A unique immunosuppressive microenvironment of decreasing NK cell percentage and increasing IL-8 concentration and CAR-T-cell exhaustion had been illustrated in the cerebrospinal fluid. Finally, the patient received immunomodulatory therapy with lenalidomide and obtained complete remission. Lenalidomide might be a therapeutic strategy for isolated CNS relapse after HSCT and CAR-T-cell therapy.",0
"Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is among the most common causes of cancer-associated deaths in children. However, little is known about the implications of deviations from ALL treatment protocols on survival rates. The present study elucidates the various characteristics of treatment deviations in children with relapsed ALL included in the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 (i.e., Relapse Berlin-Frankfurt- Münster) trial and determines their prognostic relevance for relapse and death rates. Among 687 patients, 100 were identified with treatment deviations, further classified, and examined by occurrence time, cause and type. Protocol deviation was considered a time-dependent variable and its impact on Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) was examined using the time-dependent model Mantel Byar. Five years after the relapse diagnosis, deviations were significantly related to both inferior DFS (38%) and OS (57%) rates compared to protocol conformed treatment (DFS = 61%; OS = 70%, P < 0.001). Based on multivariate analyses, protocol deviation proved to be an independent adverse prognostic factor of DFS. Moreover, deviations triggered by chemotherapy-induced toxicity were associated with a higher relapse rate compared to deviations due to insufficient response. Therefore, to avoid impairment of results by deviations, future clinical trials, and treatment strategies should focus on less toxic treatments and stricter protocol compliance.",0
"The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of direct-acting antivirals, namely ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), might be altered in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), affecting the optimum dose needed for hepatitis C virus treatment. Limited data are available evaluating the population PK of LDV/SOF and SOF metabolite GS-331007. We aimed to study whether ALL could affect population PK parameters of LDV, SOF, and the SOF major metabolite GS-331007 in hepatitis C virus-infected children, develop and validate a predictive PK model of LDV/SOF disposition in this special population, and identify their explained and unexplained sources of variability. Population PK modeling was performed using MonolixSuite software using the non-linear mixed effect modeling approach. Different compartmental models, absorption models, and lag times for absorption parameters were tested to find out the best-fitting base model. For final model development, data-driven systematic covariate analysis using conditional sampling for the stepwise approach based on the correlation tests method has been performed. The final models were then evaluated using internal validation approaches. The PK results of 22 fully compliant patients were included in the population PK analysis. LDV and SOF were best described by a 1-compartment model with zero-order absorption and lag time, while the 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time was the best-fitting model for the SOF metabolite. The internal validation approach confirmed the good predictive power of the selected models. The patients' weight explained the variability in the volume of distribution of LDV and the systemic clearance of SOF and LDV. The final SOF model also included a statistically significant covariate of steatosis stage on its volume of distribution, while the final GS-331007 model included mean corpuscular volume values on GS-331007 central compartment volume, packed cell volume, and direct bilirubin values on metabolite intercompartmental clearance. The presence of ALL did not explain any variability in the developed population PK models for SOF, LDV, and GS-331007. Despite weight being a significant covariate in the final models suggesting that weight-based dosing of LDV/SOF is better than fixed dosing, the fixed dosing (45/200 mg LDV/SOF) is more practical in terms of simplicity in dosing children at home besides the proved efficacy and safety through both the clinical outcomes and PK exposure results. Weight-based dosing is still hindered due to the absence of exposure-response analysis, and the unavailability of dose-flexible formulas in the market. Future studies are required to support these findings. NCT03903185.",0
"Oroblanco and Melogold are hybrids obtained from pummelo and grapefruit. Limonoids and flavonoids in both juices were analyzed. Oroblanco and Melogold juices contained low concentrations of limonoid glucosides, an average of 99 and 59 ppm, respectively. However, they contained relatively high concentrations of bitter limonoid aglycones, limonin and nomilin, at levels above the limonin bitterness threshold. For comparison, limonoid glucosides in juices of grapefruit, another pummelo hybrid, were also analyzed. Limonin glucoside was the major limonoid glucoside in all juices analyzed. Nomilin glucoside and nomilinic acid glucosides were also present. Oroblanco and Melogold juices contained bitter flavonoids normally found in grapefruit and pummelo including naringin, neohesperidin and poncerin in total amount of 440 ppm in Oroblanco juice and 495 ppm in Melogold juice. They also contained several other nonbitter flavonoids found in grapefruit.",1
"Treatment outcomes for older adults with B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B cell ALL) are poor, partially because of poor tolerance to intense chemotherapy. Information on patient experience-an important consideration in drug development-is lacking. We investigated the signs, symptoms, and impacts of B cell ALL on older patients (or those with comorbidities that may reduce chemotherapy tolerance). This observational study involved teleconference-based, qualitative, semi-structured interviews with patients newly diagnosed with B cell ALL, aged ≥ 55 years, or 30-54 years with ≥ 1 comorbidity. Participants described their B cell ALL experience, including signs, symptoms, and impacts, and how bothersome/disturbing these were from 0 (not at all) to 10 (greatly) at three timepoints (around diagnosis, at worst, and at interview). Salient signs/symptoms were those reported by ≥ 40%, with average disturbance ratings of ≥ 4. A conceptual model of key disease- and treatment-related signs, symptoms, and impacts was developed. Interviews with 20 participants (mean age 57.9 years; 80% diagnosed within 18 months) revealed 63 signs/symptoms and 37 impacts. All reported fatigue-related symptoms, and most reported gastrointestinal (n = 18, 90%), central/peripheral nervous system (n = 16, 80%), and pain-, respiratory-, blood-, and mouth-related (all n = 14, 70%) symptoms. Eight signs/symptoms were salient around diagnosis (fatigue, tiredness, weakness, exhaustion, shortness of breath, sweating, general pain, and diarrhea) and 16 were salient ""at worst""; four remained salient at interview (all fatigue-related). All participants reported emotional impacts, and most reported physical and social impacts (both n = 16, 80%). The most frequent impact was inability to do previous hobbies/activities (n = 15, 75%), followed by decreased ability for activities of daily living and worry/fear/nervousness (both n = 12, 60%). This study provides insight into patients' experience with newly diagnosed B cell ALL among older patients or those with clinically significant comorbidities. This enhances understanding of what matters most to patients and informs future treatment development and clinical care.",0
"Despite the success in treating newly diagnosed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (aLL), the long-term cure rate for the 20% of children who relapse is poor, making relapsed aLL the primary cause of cancer death in children. By unbiased genome-wide retroviral RNAi screening and knockdown studies, we previously discovered opioid receptor mu 1 (OPRM1) as a new aLL cell resistance biomarker for the aLL chemotherapeutic drug, L-asparaginase, i.e., OPRM1 loss triggers L-asparaginase resistance. Indeed, aLL cell OPRM1 level is inversely proportional to L-asparaginase IC50: the lower the OPRM1 level, the higher the L-asparaginase IC50, indicating that aLL cells expressing reduced OPRM1 levels show resistance to L-asparaginase. In the current study, we utilized OPRM1-expressing and -knockdown aLL cells as well as relapsed patient aLL cells to identify candidate targeted therapy for L-asparaginase-resistant aLL. In OPRM1-expressing cells, L-asparaginase induces apoptosis via a cascade of events that include OPRM1-mediated decline in [cAMP]",0
"Globally, the prevalence and incidence of perinatal intimate partner violence (IPV) are well documented and substantiated; however, there is an urgent need to identify interventions to prevent recurrence or revictimisation, and decrease the harms of perinatal IPV. This scoping review is designed to broadly capture all potential interventions for the secondary prevention of IPV, review them in detail, and assess what can reduce revictimisation and foster improvements in both maternal and neonatal outcomes. With the structure of the Joanna Briggs Institute and Arksey and O'Malley methodology for scoping reviews, the search will be conducted in: MEDLINE(R) ALL (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), APA PsycInfo (OvidSP), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (OvidSP), Web of Science, and Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts (ProQuest). A manual search of the reference lists of the retrieved articles will be conducted to capture all relevant studies for potential inclusion. A year limit of January 2000-June 2022 will be applied to retrieve most current peer-reviewed articles. No search filters or language limits will be used, but only publications in English and French will be eligible for inclusion. Interventions include but are not limited to: psychotherapy, educational sessions, home visitation, etc. Outcomes include but are not limited to: (1) harms of IPV among survivors (eg, revictimisation) and (2) adverse perinatal outcomes (eg, preterm birth). Interventions will be excluded if they target the perpetrator or child(ren) alone. Titles and abstracts of included studies will be screened in duplicate. Full-text documents will be extracted and reviewed by two independent reviewers. Conflicts between reviewers will be resolved by a third independent reviewer. Findings will be presented with descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis. Ethics approval is not required for this scoping review. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.

"The moderate consumption of red wines is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and cancer. It is well known that red wines are a rich source of flavonoids, especially of flavonols. The data on flavonol content in Bulgarian food and beverages are extremely rare. Eleven red wines traditionally consumed in Bulgaria were analyzed for free and conjugated flavonols: myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol. They were determined before and after acid hydrolysis using RP-HPLC with UV detection. The results show that Gamza wines have very low flavonol level (<1.0–4.0 mg/L). The total flavonol content for Merlot wines was 5.3–13.9 mg/L; for Cabernet Sauvignon wines, 9.3–13 mg/L; and for the Mavrud wine 14.8 mg/L. The maximum flavonol content was found in Melnik wines (12.2–16.9 mg/L). The results were compared with data from other surveys and will be included in the National Database of Food Composition.",1
"The prone transpsoas (PTP) approach for lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) is a novel technique for degenerative lumbar spine disease. However, there is a paucity of information in the literature on the complications of this procedure, with all published data consisting of small samples. We aimed to report the intraoperative and postoperative complications of PTP in the largest study to date. A retrospective electronic medical record review was conducted at 11 centers to identify consecutive patients who underwent LLIF through the PTP approach between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. The following data were collected: intraoperative characteristics (operative time, estimated blood loss [EBL], intraoperative complications [anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) rupture, cage subsidence, vascular and visceral injuries]), postoperative complications, and hospital stay. A total of 365 patients were included in the study. Among these patients, 2.2% had ALL rupture, 0.3% had cage subsidence, 0.3% had a vascular injury, 0.3% had a ureteric injury, and no other visceral injuries were reported. Mean operative time was 226.2 ± 147.9 minutes. Mean EBL was 138.4 ± 215.6 mL. Mean hospital stay was 2.7 ± 2.2 days. Postoperative complications included new sensory symptoms-8.2%, new lower extremity weakness-5.8%, wound infection-1.4%, cage subsidence-0.8%, psoas hematoma-0.5%, small bowel obstruction and ischemia-0.3%, and 90-day readmission-1.9%. In this multicenter case series, the PTP approach was well tolerated and associated with a satisfactory safety profile.",0
"The phenolic fraction of plant extracts has been linked to their antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity. In the present paper, RP-HPLC with UV detection was employed to distinguish phenolic compounds from the other constituents of the plants examined. The phenolic substances were identified and quantified after comparison with reference standards. A GC–MS method is also presented for characterization of different phenolics as trimethylsilyl derivatives. The antioxidant capacity was determined, in dried plants and in their methanol extracts, with the Rancimat test using sunflower oil as substrate. Both pulverized plants and extracts showed antioxidant capacity. Total phenolic content in the extracts was determined spectrometrically applying the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. It ranged from 2.9 to 28.2 mg gallic acid/100 g dry sample. Antimicrobial activity of the extracts against selected microorganisms was also investigated.",1
"Several vegetables were selected to study their flavonoid contents and antioxidant activities. The results showed that both green and purple leaves of sweet potatoes (185.01 and 426.82 mg kg−1 respectively) and the outer leaves of onion (264.03 mg kg−1) possessed higher amounts of flavonoids, and more than 85% of free radical scavenging activities were evaluated by using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. In addition, green leaves of sweet potatoes and the outer leaves of onion showed higher reducing power and higher antioxidant activity in a linoleic acid system as compared to cabbage, spinach, potato and crown daisy. Blanching of green leaves of sweet potatoes for 30–60 s retained more flavonoids and higher free radical scavenging activities as compared to more than 1 min of blanching. The storage test showed that green leaves of sweet potatoes stored at 4–10 °C maintained better quality than those stored at room temperature.",1
"Vidalia onion varieties Nirvana, DPS 1032, Yellow 2025, King-Midas, and SBO 133 grown at Vidalia, Georgia, were analyzed for flavonoid content. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array detection was used for quantification. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation (r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant capacity. The data indicate that Vidalia onions are a rich source of quercetin, and they also contain myricetin and kaempferol.",1

"Total equivalent antioxidant capacities (TEAC) and phenolic contents of 32 spices extracts from 21 botanical families grown in Poland were investigated. The total antioxidant capacity was estimated by the following methods: ABTS + (2,2′azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) expressed as TEAC. The total phenolics were measured using a Folin–Ciocalteu assay. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of major phenolics by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were also used. Major phenolic acids identified in analyzed species were caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic and neochlorogenic, while predominant flavonoids were quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin. Myricetin was detected only in Epilobium hirsutum. Many investigated spices had high levels of phenolics and exhibited high antioxidant capacity. The TEAC values of the spices ranged from 1.76 to 346μMtrolox/100gdw, from 7.34 to 2021μMtrolox/100gdw, and 13.8 to 2133μMtrolox/100gdw for ABTS +, DPPH and FRAP, respectively. The total phenolic content, measured using a Folin–Ciocalteu assay, ranged from 0.07 to 15.2mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100gdw. The herbs with the highest TEAC values were Syzygium aromaticum, E. hirsutum and the species belonging to the Labiatae and Compositae family. A positive relationship between TEAC (ABTS + and FRAP) values and total phenolic content, measured by HPLC, was found only in family groups with many representative herbs within Labiatae and Compositae.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy and requires a unique pattern of healthcare utilization including an acute/emergent presentation and an intensive initial 8 months of therapy followed by two years of outpatient treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic caused massive global disruptions in healthcare use and delivery. This report aims to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation, diagnosis and continued management of childhood ALL in regard to utilization and cost of care. Utilizing a commercial insurance claims database, 529 pediatric patients were identified who were diagnosed with ALL and completed their initial 8 months of treatment between January 2016 and December 2021. New diagnoses were evaluated by era and demographics. Utilization was measured by COVID-related era as number of inpatient and outpatient encounters, inpatient days, and cumulative cost. None of these cost or utilization factors changed significantly during or shortly after the pandemic. These findings reinforce that the necessary care for pediatric ALL is largely inflexible and was unwavering despite the massive shifts in the healthcare system caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This provides a valuable benchmark as we further examine the factors that influence the pandemic's impact on health equity and access to care, especially in vulnerable pediatric populations. This is the first investigation of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on utilization and cost of care in pediatric cancer.",0
"Peanuts are consumed mostly as processed products. Although the effect of processing on isoflavone composition of legumes has been extensively studied, there has been no such study on peanuts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of processing (boiling, oil- and dry-roasting) on the phytochemical composition of peanuts. Boiling had a significant effect on the phytochemical composition of peanuts compared to oil- and dry-roasting. Boiled peanuts had the highest total flavonoid and polyphenol content. The biochanin A and genistein content of boiled peanut extracts were two- and fourfold higher, respectively. trans-Resveratrol was detected only in the boiled peanuts, with the commercial product having a significantly (p < or = 0.05) higher concentration. Ultraviolet and mass spectrometry chromatograms for the boiled peanut extracts show the presence of four additional peaks that were not observed in the raw peanut extracts.",1
"Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. The metabolic fate of its major constituents, catechins, however, is not well-known. In this study, two catechin metabolites were detected in the urine and plasma of human volunteers after ingestion of green tea. These metabolites were identified by LC/ESI-MS and NMR as (−)-5-(3‘,4‘,5‘-trihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (M4) and (−)-5-(3‘,4‘-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (M6). The renal excretion of M4 and M6 had a 3 h lag time and peaked 7.5−13.5 h after ingestion of a single dose of green tea, while (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (−)-epicatechin peaked at 2 h. M4 and M6 were two major tea metabolites with urinary cumulative excretions as high as 8−25 times the levels of EGC and (−)-epicatechin in some of our subjects, and accounted for 6−39% of the amounts of ingested EGC and (−)-epicatechin. Both the metabolites appeared to be produced by intestinal microorganisms, with EGC and (−)-epicatechin as the precursors of M4 and M6, respectively. Repeated ingestion of green tea produced a slight accumulative effect of the metabolites. They were also detected in the plasma, exhibiting kinetics similar to those of the urinary metabolites, and in the feces. Study on these metabolites may help us further understand the cancer chemopreventive actions and other beneficial effects of tea.",1
"The content and composition of the polyphenolic compounds and the activity of polyphenoloxidase were determined in some plum varieties popular in Poland: węgierka Dąbrowicka, Zwykła, Łowicka, Stanley, and also in wild plum - ałycza. The total polyphenols content in investigated plums, as well as anthocyanins and flavanols, was rather low (160-300mg/100g, 18-33 mg/100 g and 9-14 mg/100 g of fruits, respectively). (+)Catechin occurring in quantities from 1.3 to 3.9 mg/100 g was found to be a dominant compound representing biologically active monomers and dimers of flavanols. The highest quantities of hydroxycinnamic acids, especially neochlorogenic one, (46 - 85 mg/100 g) are found in all plum varieties. The main anthocyanin pigments of plums are cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidine-3-rutinoside; they make up 42 to 62% of the total anthocyanins. All investigated plum varieties show high polyphenoloxidase activity but there are substantial differences between particular varieties ranging from 3200 to 17200 U/g.",1
"The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of the freeze-drying process and storage on onion flavonoids content. Major flavonols of a mature red onion bulb were confirmed as quercetin derivatives (3,4′-O-diglucoside (Qdg) and 4′-O-monoglucoside (Qmg)) using a combination of chromatographic comparisons, UV–visible spectra and scientific literature data. These two components account for about a 93% of the total flavonols (334 ± 60 mg Q kg−1, fresh weight), and are the main responsible for the IC50 antioxidant activity of 15.84 ± 3.73 g/kg. The remaining flavonol fraction (approx. 7%) comprises up to 8 different components of which quercetin-3-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin-4-glucoside are prominent members although each contribute less than 3% of the total flavonol fraction; instead, quercetin represents less than 1% of total flavonols. In this red onion, eight anthocyanins (which represent less than 1% of total flavonols) were also found at a total level of 2.1 ± 0.05 mg C3g kg−1 (fresh weight). Anyway, 4 of them (cyanidin 3-glucoside (C3g) > cyanidin 3-(6′′-malonylglucoside) (C3,6mg) > cyanidin 3-(6′′- malonyl-laminaribioside) (C3,6mlmb) > cyanidin 3-laminaribioside (C3lmb)) account for the 95% of total anthocyanins. Freeze-drying process concludes in an increase in the extraction of flavonoids up to a 32% for flavonols and 25% for anthocyanins. Freeze-dried onion powder storage at room temperature, in dark, in air- and water-tight glass bottles for up to 6 months was keeping rather stable all flavonoids.",1
"The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.",1
"BACKGROUND Mucormycosis, a cause of opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, is rarely identified in the penis. The literature often describes drastic surgical interventions or rapid patient demise, with scant mention of surgical management specifics. The objective of this report is to detail our experience with this unique infection and highlight the utility of intraoperative frozen margins during surgical management. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe successful treatment of a 55-year-old man with biopsy-proven B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) undergoing Hyper-CVAD (Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Adriamycin, and Dexamethasone) therapy who initially presented with an asymptomatic violaceous lesion of the penis. Differential diagnoses ranged from infectious, vasculogenic, and pharmacologic in nature. Ultimately, a punch biopsy tissue culture confirmed angioinvasive fungal infection with Rhizopus and Fusarium species. Initial debridement combined with intravenous antifungal therapy was unsuccessful. However, partial penectomy with use of intraoperative frozen margins, a 5-week course of antifungal therapy, and continued B-ALL treatment allowed effective and lasting resolution of the infection, with partial penile preservation. CONCLUSIONS This case supports a multidisciplinary approach as the primary treatment for penile angioinvasive fungal infections. This includes treatment of the underlying immunocompromising condition, appropriate intravenous antifungal therapy, and urgent operative debridement. This report highlights the importance of utilizing intraoperative frozen sections to ensure negative margins and to optimize overall tissue sparing in this anatomically sensitive area.",0
"There is interest in using cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) immunotherapy to treat blood cancers. Unfortunately, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) frequently exhibit resistance to treatment and natural killer (NK) cell exhaustion. This study aims to increase the cytotoxic potency of natural killer cells by using CTLA-4 to block the Nalm-6 leukaemia cell line. In this experimental study, NK cells were purified from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 10 healthy people and assessed by flow cytometry for purity and viability. The purified cells were activated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2 with interleukin-15 (IL-15, 10 ng/ml) followed by evaluation of expressions of CTLA-4, activating and inhibitory receptors, and the release of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and granzyme B (GZM B). CTLA-4 expression on NK cells from recurrent ALL patients was also evaluated. Finally, the cytotoxic activity of NK cells was assessed after the CTLA-4 blockade. The purity of the isolated cells was 96.58 ± 2.57%. Isolated NK cells activated with IL-15 resulted in significantly higher CTLA-4 expression (8.75%, P<0.05). Similarly, CTLA-4 expression on the surface of NK cells from patients with ALL was higher (7.46%) compared to healthy individuals (1.46%, P<0.05). IL-15 reduced NKG2A expression (P<0.01), and increased expressions of NKP30 (P<0.05) and NKP46 (P<0.01). The activated NK cells released more IFN-γ (P<0.5) and GZM B (P<0.01) compared to unactivated NK cells. Blockade of CTLA-4 enhanced the NK cell killing potential against Nalm-6 cells (56.3%, P<0.05); however, IFN-γ and GZM B levels were not statistically different between the blocked and non-blocked groups. Our findings suggest that CTLA-4 blockage of Nalm-6 cells causes an increase in antitumour activity of NK cells against these cells. Our study also provides evidence for the potential of cancer immunotherapy treatment using blocking anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.",0
"Beans were pearled to evaluate the feasibility of increasing antioxidant activity and phenolic antioxidants. Phenolics were concentrated mostly in the hull fraction at about 56 mg of catechin equivalents per gram of sample. The methanolic extracts of the pearled bean samples were screened for antioxidant potential using the beta-carotene-linoleate and the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. The pearled material, also referred to as milled samples, exhibited antioxidant activity that correlated with phenolic content and inhibited DPPH significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Phenolics and antioxidant activities were also examined in chromatographic fractions of methanolic extracts of manually obtained hulls that represented a model used previously to ascertain antimutagenic activity. Fractions extracted with ethyl acetate/acetone and acetone displayed antioxidant activity, which implies potent free radical scavenging activity with antimutagenic activity.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is a rare aggressive haematological malignancy characterised by the clonal expansion of immature T-cell precursors. It accounts for 15% of paediatric and 25% of adult ALL. T-ALL is associated with the overexpression of major transcription factors (TLX1/3, TAL1, HOXA) that drive specific transcriptional programmes and constitute the molecular classifying subgroups of T-ALL. Although the dysregulation of transcription factor oncogenes is frequently associated with chromosomal translocations in T-ALL, epigenetic dysregulation resulting in changes to post-translational modifications of histones has also been reported. This includes non-coding intergenic mutations that form oncogenic neo-enhancers. This review will focus on the known epigenetically activating intergenic mutations reported in T-ALL, and will discuss the wider implications of neo-enhancer mutations in cancer.",0

"Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin diglucuronides in the gut, liver, and kidneys and glucuronyl sulfates of methylated quercetin in plasma. The main site of quercetin metabolism seemed to be the gastrointestinal tract. Quercetin metabolites may have a major influence on the gut mucosal epithelium and on colonic disease.",1
"Relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) and lymphomas have poor patient outcomes; novel therapies are needed. CD22 is an attractive target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), being highly expressed in R/R B-ALL with rapid internalization kinetics. ADCT-602 is a novel CD22-targeting ADC, consisting of humanized mAb hLL2-C220, site specifically conjugated to the pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer-based payload tesirine. In preclinical studies, ADCT-602 demonstrated potent, specific cytotoxicity in CD22-positive lymphomas and leukemias. ADCT-602 was specifically bound, internalized, and trafficked to lysosomes in CD22-positive tumor cells; after cytotoxin release, DNA interstrand crosslink formation persisted for 48 hours. In the presence of CD22-positive tumor cells, ADCT-602 caused bystander killing of CD22-negative tumor cells. A single ADCT-602 dose led to potent, dose-dependent, in vivo antitumor activity in subcutaneous and disseminated human lymphoma/leukemia models. Pharmacokinetic analyses (rat and cynomolgus monkey) showed excellent stability and tolerability of ADCT-602. Cynomolgus monkey B cells were efficiently depleted from circulation after one dose. Gene signature association analysis revealed IRAK1 as a potential marker for ADCT-602 resistance. Combining ADCT-602 + pacritinib was beneficial in ADCT-602-resistant cells. Chidamide increased CD22 expression on B-cell tumor surfaces, increasing ADCT-602 activity. These data support clinical testing of ADCT-602 in R/R B-ALL (NCT03698552) and CD22-positive hematologic cancers.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a hematological cancer characterized by the infiltration of immature T-cells in the bone marrow. Aberrant NOTCH signaling in T-ALL is mainly triggered by activating mutations of NOTCH1 and overexpression of NOTCH3, and rarely is it linked to NOTCH3-activating mutations. Besides the known critical role of NOTCH, the nature of intrathymic microenvironment-dependent mechanisms able to render immature thymocytes, presumably pre-leukemic cells, capable of escaping thymus retention and infiltrating the bone marrow is still unclear. An important challenge is understanding how leukemic cells shape their tumor microenvironment to increase their ability to infiltrate and survive within. Our previous data indicated that hyperactive NOTCH3 affects the CXCL12/CXCR4 system and may interfere with T-cell/stroma interactions within the thymus. This study aims to identify the biological effects of the reciprocal interactions between human leukemic cell lines and thymic epithelial cell (TEC)-derived soluble factors in modulating NOTCH signaling and survival programs of T-ALL cells and TECs. The overarching hypothesis is that this crosstalk can influence the progressive stages of T-cell development driving T-cell leukemia. Thus, we investigated the effect of extracellular space conditioned by T-ALL cell lines (Jurkat, TALL1, and Loucy) and TECs and studied their reciprocal regulation of cell cycle and survival. In support, we also detected metabolic changes as potential drivers of leukemic cell survival. Our studies could shed light on T-cell/stroma crosstalk to human leukemic cells and propose our culture system to test pharmacological treatment for T-ALL.",0
"In the bloodstream, nanoparticles (NPs) interact with serum proteins to form the protein corona, which includes both opsonins, promoting NP recognition and elimination, and dysopsonins, which can inhibit opsonin activity. Albumin, the most abundant serum protein, is part of this corona and can act as a dysopsonin, potentially hiding NPs from the immune system. This study aims to investigate how a covalently bound layer of human serum albumin (HSA) on polymeric NPs affects the protein corona and their behavior in the immune system. We covalently attached HSA to the surface of polymeric NPs to modify the protein corona composition. These HSA-covered nanostructures were then decorated with an anti-CD19 recombinant antibody fragment to target malignant B cells, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. The safety profile and bioavailability of these targeted HSA-nanoparticles were evaluated in vitro and in vivo using a human-zebrafish xenograft model of ALL. The efficacy of the nanostructures in delivering encapsulated doxorubicin and suppressing tumor growth was also assessed. The HSA coating on polymeric NPs effectively modified the protein corona, preventing opsonization and subsequent macrophage-mediated elimination. The targeted HSA-nanoparticles maintained a safe profile with reduced macrophage interaction and specifically targeted tumor cells in the xenograft model. This resulted in the successful delivery of doxorubicin, tumor growth suppression, and increased survival of the model organisms. The study demonstrates that HSA-coated nanoparticles can be used as a therapeutic nanoplatform with a safe profile and enhanced bioavailability. The ability to decorate these nanostructures with specific targeting agents, such as anti-CD19 antibodies, opens up the potential for developing versatile therapeutic platforms that can be tailored to target various clinical conditions.",0
"A mandarin-type citrus fruit, ponkan (Citrus reticulata), was processed by in-line, chopper pulper, and hand-press extractions to investigate the effect of extraction method on the concentrations of bioactive compounds in processed juice. Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line (8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the others. The inhibitory effect of hand-press juice extract on platelet cyclooxygenase activity was remarkable among juice extracts. All juice extracts effectively inhibited polymorphonuclear 5-lipoxygenase activity at nearly the same rate.",1
"This study was carried out to determine the total antioxidant activity and phenolic content of selected common vegetables. The effect of thermal treatment on antioxidant activity and phenolic content were also studied. Kale, spinach, cabbage, swamp cabbage and shallots were used in this study. Among all the vegetables (fresh and thermally treated), shallots showed the highest total antioxidant activity followed by spinach, swamp cabbage, cabbage and kale. Spinach had an exceptionally high total phenolic content, followed by swamp cabbage, kale, shallots and cabbage. Except for shallots and cabbage, the antioxidant activities of kale, spinach and swamp cabbage were significantly decreased (p<0.05) after thermal treatment. Moreover, this study revealed that a 1-min thermal treatment significantly decreased (p<0.05) the total phenolic content of all vegetables studied.",1
"Managing a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after relapse is arduous in low- and middle-income countries. A file review of children aged ≤15 years diagnosed with relapsed ALL from 2010 to 2019 was performed. Classification of relapse followed the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) scheme. The majority of patients were treated with a modified ALL-REZ-BFM protocol. Of 764 children treated for ALL in the study period, 163 (21.3%) relapsed. The median age at relapse was 101 months (range: 8-297). The immunophenotype was B-ALL and T-ALL in 140 (86%) and 23 (14%) patients. The site of relapse was extramedullary, combined, and medullary in 46 (28%), 45 (28%), and 72 (44%) patients.

"To study the effect of polyphenolics on antioxidant activities of cabbages, the amounts of total phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity and individual phenolic compounds in raw and processed cabbages were determined. Fresh and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest total phenolic contents (393.1+/-10.8 mg and 366.3+/-3.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh sample, respectively). Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids (108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.",1
"The lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LH/CGR) belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family, characterized by conserved leucine residues in their carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails. This study aimed to investigate the functional significance of the equine LH/CGR (eLH/CGR) trileucine motif in signal transduction. Wild-type eLH/CGR (eLH/CGR-wt) and mutant receptors, in which the trileucine motif was altered to alanine (eLH/CGR-ALL, LAL, LLA, and AAA), were analyzed in transfected cells. The expression levels of mutants ranged from 60% to 78%, with eLH/CGR-AAA showing the lowest level. Although the trileucine motif did not individually affect cAMP responsiveness, the combined mutant (eLH/CGR-AAA) significantly reduced cAMP response, surface receptor levels and enhanced receptor internalization rates. Activation of phospho-ERK1/2 was rapid in all mutants, peaking at 5 min, but eLH/CGR-ALL and LAL mutants exhibited a sharp decline in activity at 15 min. Notably, the eLH/CGR-LLA and AAA mutants showed similar phospho-ERK1/2 activity as the wild type. The eLH/CGR-AAA mutant also displayed a two-fold reduction in PKA signal transduction. These findings suggest that while individual leucine residues of the trileucine motif do not affect cAMP responsiveness, the entire motif plays a crucial role in receptor trafficking and signaling, specifically influencing PKA and phospho-ERK1/2 pathways.",0
"The phenolic compounds chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, protocatechuic acid, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, phloridzin and di-, tri- and tetrameric procyanidins in apple juice were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 column using a methanol-dilute hydrochloric acid solvent gradient. Absorbance ratios and UV spectrometry were used to identify the separated phenolic compounds and to check their purity.",1
"A careful investigation on the potential application of solid phase extraction (SPE)-gas chromatography procedure in the analysis of phenol compounds in virgin olive oils was carried out. In doped refined olive oil samples a comparison between liquid/liquid and SPE extraction evidenced higher recovery when the C18 sorbent phase was employed whereas, in the case of total suppression of residual sylanolic group (C18 EC), only contradictory data was obtained. The same procedures were carried out on 10 genuine samples of virgin olive oil. As observed with the standards, C18 sorbent phase gave higher values compared to C18 EC and the liquid/liquid extraction procedures. Satisfactory results were obtained in the detection of ligstroside aglycon but for the oleuropein aglycon the quantitative is not completely reliable for the overlap of some unknown no-phenol compounds.",1
"The role of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-ALL) remains controversial. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze results of AHSCT and to identify prognostic factors. Overall, 700 patients transplanted in first complete remission between the years 1999-2020 were included. Median patient age was 31.9 years (68% male). B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) and T-cell precursor ALL (TCP-ALL) was diagnosed in 35% and 65%, respectively. Among 190 patients with available data, negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status was reported in 167 (88%) cases. The probabilities of overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years were 67% and 56%; relapse incidence (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 39% and 5%, respectively. TCP-ALL was associated with lower RI (41% vs. 56%, p=0.001), higher LFS (52% vs. 38%, p=0.002) and OS (58% vs 45%, p=0.001) at 5 years when compared to BCP-ALL. In the multivariate analysis, TCP-ALL and longer interval from diagnosis do AHSCT were associated with reduced risk of relapse (HR 0.7, p=0.006 and HR=0.95, p=0.018), better LFS (HR=0.76, p=0.02 and HR=0.95, p=0.01) and OS (HR=0.75, p=0.024 and HR=0.94, p=0.013, respectively). Increasing patient age was associated with higher NRM (HR=1.49, p<0.0001), worse LFS (HR=1.1, p=0.01) and OS (HR=1.17, p=0.0001). Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is relatively safe option of late treatment intensification in adults with Ph- ALL. It may be a valuable option especially in patients with TCP-ALL, however it should be proved in prospective clinical trials.",0
"The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The content in sinapic acid ranged from 70 to 140 microgram g(-1) dry matter, p-coumaric acid ranged from 40 to 70 microgram g(-1) dry matter, and caffeic, p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, and vanillic acids were all detected in concentrations less than 20 microgram g(-1) dry matter. The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA (40-70 microgram g(-1) dry matter), and 8,5 -DiFA (20-40 microgram g(-1) dry matter).",1

The developed method was applied to a wide range of commercially available instant coffees.",1
"CRLF2 rearrangements occur in >50% of Ph-like and Down syndrome (DS)-associated B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and induce constitutive kinase signaling targetable by the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib under current clinical investigation. While chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) immunotherapies have achieved remarkable remission rates in children with relapsed/refractory B-ALL, ~50% of CD19CART-treated patients relapse again, many with CD19 antigen loss. We previously reported preclinical activity of thymic stromal lymphopoietin receptor-targeted cellular immunotherapy (TSLPRCART) against CRLF2-overexpressing ALL as an alternative approach. In this study, we posited that combinatorial TSLPRCART and ruxolitinib would have superior activity and first validated potent TSLPRCART-induced inhibition of leukemia proliferation in vitro in CRLF2-rearranged ALL cell lines and in vivo in Ph-like and DS-ALL patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. However, simultaneous TSLPRCART/ruxolitinib or CD19CART/ruxolitinib treatment during initial CART expansion diminished T cell proliferation, blunted cytokine production, and/or facilitated leukemia relapse, which was abrogated by time-sequenced/delayed ruxolitinib co-exposure. Importantly, ruxolitinib co-administration prevented fatal TSLPRCART cytokine-associated toxicity in ALL PDX mice. Upon ruxolitinib withdrawal, TSLPRCART functionality recovered in vivo with clearance of subsequent ALL rechallenge. These translational studies demonstrate an effective two-pronged therapeutic strategy that mitigates acute CART-induced hyperinflammation and provides potential anti-leukemia 'maintenance' relapse prevention for CRLF2-rearranged Ph-like and DS-ALL.",0
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is a promising treatment for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B ALL). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a common toxicity after CAR T cell therapy and fever is often the first symptom. Differentiating CRS from infection after CAR T cell therapy can be challenging. Plasma microbial cell free DNA (mcfDNA) is a novel diagnostic tool which allows for qualitative and quantitative assessment of over 1000 organisms. This pilot study sought to characterize mcfDNA results in pediatric patients with R/R B ALL in the first 2 months after CAR T cell therapy.,0
"The effect of homogenization and thermal processing on a number of bioactive compounds (carotenoids, total phenolics, ascorbic acid and folates) in both raw tomato puree (RTP) and “hot break” tomato puree (HTP) was investigated. RTP and HTP were homogenized in either one or two-steps, followed by pasteurization at 98 °C for 40 s. Additionally, HTP was pasteurized in parallel at 98 °C, 108 °C and 128 °C. In general, homogenization had no effect, but changes were observed after pasteurization (98 °C for 40 s). Carotenoids were relatively resistant to thermal degradation, whereas total phenolic content and ascorbic acid significantly decreased. However, a higher content of folates was determined in the homogenized and pasteurized samples due to their higher extraction from the subcellular compartment. The increase in pasteurization temperatures of the HTP up to 128 °C led to a decrease of ascorbic acid, total phenolic compounds and folates. In conclusion, homogenization and pasteurization at 98 °C for 40 s improves the nutritional value of tomato puree, increasing the extractability of the folates and maintaining the carotenoid content.",1
"Recent studies show that the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax is a promising therapeutic drug for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), especially in high-risk subtypes including early T-cell precursor (ETP)-ALL, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like B-cell ALL, and KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. The preclinical and early-phase clinical research shows that venetoclax-based combinations can increase apoptosis and improve response rates when used with chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents. The main challenge to venetoclax efficacy remains the resistance mechanisms that primarily involve myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) and BCL-extra large (XL). This review provides an overview of the current state of venetoclax in ALL by discussing its mechanistic basis and clinical trial results as well as safety data and strategies to overcome resistance and enhance venetoclax-based treatments.",0
"Certain viruses have been found to induce diverse biological pathways to carcinogenesis, evidenced by the presence of viral gene products in some tumors. Despite the fact that many fungal agents contain mycoviruses, until recently, their possible direct effects on human health, including carcinogenesis and leukemogenesis, had not been explored. In this regard, most studies of fungal agents have rightly concentrated on their mycotoxin formation and effects. Recently, the direct role of yeasts and fungi in the etiology of cancers, including leukemia, have been investigated. While greater attention has been placed on the carcinogenic effects of",0
"Polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene exon 1 can decrease serum levels of mannose-binding lectin (MBL), increasing the risk of infection in immunocompromised individuals. This study evaluated the association between the polymorphism in exon 1 of the MBL2 gene, genotypes, serum MBL levels, and infection in 122 patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). The MBL*A allele exhibited the highest frequency (0.37) within the study population. The MBL*D (0.32) was the predominant variant. The combined frequency of O polymorphic alleles (either B or D) was 0.63. The frequencies of the A/A, A/O and O/O genotypes were 0.13, 0.49 and 0.38, respectively. All patients exhibited consistently low levels of serum MBL, irrespective of their exon 1 genotype. Parasitic infections (n = 103), bacterial (n = 69) and viral (n = 48). A/O genotype (0.49) had higher infection rates, A/A (0.13) had lower rates, and O/O showed increased viral susceptibility (OR: 0.37; 95% CI 0.13-1.06; p = 0.05). Our findings demonstrated that the study population were MBL-deficient, regardless of their MLB2 genotype. Individuals with the A/O genotype had more infections, while those with the O/O genotype appeared more susceptible to viral infections. These findings highlight the impact of MBL levels and genetic variants on infection susceptibility in ALL patients.",0
"Depression is a highly prevalent psychopathological condition among older adults, particularly those institutionalized in nursing homes (NHs). Unfortunately, it is poorly identified and diagnosed. NH residents are twice as likely to fall as community-dwelling older adults. There is a need for more knowledge about the mechanisms and relationships between depression and falls. This study aims to identify, analyze, and synthesize research on the relationships between depression and falls among NH residents. A literature search was conducted in October 2023 in the following bibliographic databases: MEDLINE ALL Ovid, Embase, CINAHL with Full Text EBSCO, APA PsycInfo Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Wiley, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I. Clinical trials were searched for in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Wiley, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Additional searches were performed using Google Scholar, the DART-Europe E-theses Portal, and backward citation tracking. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies were used to evaluate study quality. The review included 7 quantitative studies published in 7 different countries from 3 continents; of these, 6 (86%) were cross-sectional studies, and 1 (14%) was a prospective cohort study. Results suggested high frequencies of depressive symptoms and falls among older adults living in NHs, and depressive symptoms were considered a risk factor for falls. The 15-item and 10-item versions of the Geriatric Depression Scale were the most commonly used measurement tools, followed by the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia and the Resident Assessment Instrument-Minimum Data Set 2.0. The prevalence of depression was heterogeneous, varying from 21.5% to 47.7% of NH residents. The studies used heterogeneous descriptions of a fall, and some considered the risk of falls, recurrent fallers, and near falls in their data. The prevalence of fallers was disparate, varying from 17.2% to 63.1%. Of the 7 retained studies, 6 (86%) reported a relationship between depression and falls or the risk of falls. Among the 19 other risk factors identified in the review as being associated with falls among NH residents were a history of falls in the last 180 days, >1 fall in the past 12 months, and respiratory illnesses. There is a paucity of research examining falls among older adults with depressive symptoms in NHs. These findings should alert nurses to the need to consider depression as a risk factor in their work to prevent falls. More research is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of fall risk among NH residents with depressive symptoms. RR2-10.2196/46995.",0
"Our previous study showed that a high pre-transplant nucleated cell count in the bone marrow is associated with increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) and decreased overall survival (OS) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in remission. In this retrospective multicenter study, we aimed to examine the association between nucleated cell subfractions and transplant outcomes using the same patient cohort as our previous study. This study included patients with ALL who underwent their first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) between 2010 and 2022. The patients were stratified into high and low cell group levels to compare transplant outcomes using cutoff values for predicting OS in each subfraction determined using receiver operating curves. In the cohort of 134 patients, the median values for myeloid, erythroid, monocyte, and lymphocyte series were 16,860/µL (468-229,296), 15,584/µL (34-246,992), 1,446/µL (70-25,296), and 4,215/µL (90-33,856), respectively. The univariate analysis showed that the groups with high levels of myeloid cells (≥38,000/µL, n = 48), erythroid cells (≥25,000/µL, n = 45), and monocyte cells (≥4,200/µL, n = 44) were all associated with worse 3-year OS and higher NRM than the low-level groups. These findings were confirmed by using multivariate analysis. The high cell count group showed a higher incidence of NRM associated with acute graft-versus-host disease or immunological disorders. High myeloid, erythroid, and monocytic cell levels in the bone marrow before allo-HSCT may independently increase the risk of NRM and reduce OS.",0
"Graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCY) has been established to reduce severe GVHD, and thereby potentially reducing nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). We evaluated the predictive capacity of established NRM-risk scores in patients receiving PTCY-based GVHD prophylaxis, and subsequently developed and validated a novel PTCY-specific NRM-risk model. Adult patients (n = 1861) with AML or ALL in first complete remission who received alloSCT with PTCY-based GVHD prophylaxis were included. The PTCY-risk score was developed using multivariable Fine and Gray regression, selecting parameters from the hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) score with a subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) of ≥1.2 for 2-year NRM in the training set (70% split), which was validated in the test set (30%). The performance of the EBMT score, HCT-CI, and integrated EBMT score was relatively poor for discriminating 2-year NRM (c-statistic 51.7%, 56.6%, and 59.2%, respectively). The PTCY-risk score included 10 variables which were collapsed in 3 risk groups estimating 2-year NRM of 11% ± 2%, 19% ± 2%, and 36% ± 3% (training set, c-statistic 64%), and 11% ± 2%, 18% ± 3%, and 31% ± 5% (test set, c-statistic 63%), which also translated into different overall survival. Collectively, we developed an NRM-risk score for acute leukemia patients receiving PTCY that better predicted 2-year NRM compared with existing models, which might be applicable to the specific toxicities of high-dose cyclophosphamide.",0
"Artichoke is a traditionally consumed vegetable in many countries. In the past decade, the immature (baby) variety has been successfully introduced in the international food markets. The aim of this study is to compare the chemical composition and antioxidant properties of mature and baby artichokes, in raw state and after cooking. For this purpose, the proximate chemical analysis was estimated, and aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained to determine the contents of total polyphenols, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and cynarin. Proximate analysis revealed that cooking increased proteins and lipids in baby artichokes (p<0.05). The total phenolics content was similar in mature and baby artichokes and increased after cooking (p<0.05). Cooked baby artichokes exhibited the highest total phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and cynarin contents, as well as free radical scavenging capacity, measured as DPPH. Our results show that baby artichokes exhibit higher scavenging capacity than mature artichokes, and thus they constitute a particularly interesting source of putative antioxidant polyphenols, a quality that is improved by the application of thermal treatment.",1
"Transient hyperglycemia during induction chemotherapy is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Treatment with glucocorticoids, asparaginase, and stress are the proposed causal factors. Although these risks are not exclusive to induction, glycemic control throughout the remainder of ALL/lymphoma (ALL/ALLy) therapy has not been described. Furthermore, prior research has been limited to transient hyperglycemia. This study aimed to characterize glycemic control throughout ALL/ALLy and to evaluate risk factors and outcomes associated with increased mean glucose and glucose coefficient of variation (glucose CV) during induction chemotherapy. The records for 220 pediatric/young adult patients, age 1 to 26 years, who underwent treatment for ALL/ALLy from 2010 to 2014 at Children's Hospital Colorado were retrospectively reviewed. Measures of glycemic control were calculated for each cycle. For the cycle with the highest mean glucose, induction (n=208), multivariable models were performed to identify potential risk factors and consequences of increased glucose. Highest mean glucose by cycle were induction 116 mg/dL, pretreatment 108 mg/dL, delayed intensification 96 mg/dL, and maintenance 93 mg/dL; these cycles also had the most glycemic variability. During induction, patients with Down syndrome, or who were ≥12 years and overweight/obese, had higher mean glucoses; age and overweight/obese status were each associated with increased glucose CV. In multivariable analysis, neither induction mean glucose nor glucose CV were associated with increased hazard of infection, relapse, or death.",0
"Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are warranted.",1
"Plant oils provide a rich source of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and mostly lipophilic antioxidants. PUFAs are both in their free form and as components of glycerolipids preferred targets of free radical-induced oxidation, leading to the formation of highly atherogenic compounds. Thus, stabilization of polyunsaturated lipids by radical scavengers in the oils is important in order to avoid pathophysiological side effects of these essential components of our diet. To determine lipid oxidizability and its inhibition by endogenous antioxidants, we developed a simple fluorescence technique. It is based on solubilisation of the oils in aqueous buffer, labeling of the resulting emulsions with a suitable reporter fluorophore, which reflects lipid oxidation, and continuous monitoring of the decomposition process. Using this method, we found that oxidizability of the oils depended only to a limited extent on the content of lipophilic antioxidants. In addition, a smaller fraction of polar (phenolic) compounds showed comparable protective effects, especially in pumpkin seed oil, which is a non-refined product therefore containing antioxidative components that are removed from most other edible oils during processing. Therefore, the contribution of these “minor” compounds has to be taken into account when potential biological effects of plant oils are evaluated.",1
"Failure, persistent knee instability, and reinjury rates after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are still concerns. Biomechanical investigations have highlighted the role of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) as a crucial knee stabilizer, and clinical outcomes after combined ACL and ALL reconstruction appear to indicate the success of the procedure. To compare the functional outcomes, return-to-sport (RTS) rate, and complications between combined ACL and ALL reconstruction and isolated ACL reconstruction. Meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 4. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central databases were used to search keywords, and a total of 16 studies were included. The data extracted for quantitative analysis included the Tegner activity scale score, Lysholm knee score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, laxity measured using the KT-1000 knee arthrometer, number and types of complications, RTS rate, and survival rate. Random- and fixed-effects models were used for the meta-analysis of pooled mean differences and odds ratios. A total of 2329 patients were identified, 1116 of whom underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction and 1213 of whom underwent isolated ACL reconstruction. The mean ages were 25.4 ± 7.2 years and 26.5 ± 7.8 years for the combined ACL and ALL reconstruction and isolated ACL reconstruction groups, respectively. The mean follow-ups were 40.3 ± 21.4 months and 42.5 ± 21.6 months, respectively. Comparable Tegner activity scale ( Compared with isolated ACL reconstruction, combined ACL and ALL reconstruction yielded comparable functional outcomes but significantly less residual knee laxity and a lower graft failure rate. Patients who underwent combined ACL and ALL reconstruction also had higher RTS and survival rates.",0
"Minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) evaluation has resulted in a fundamental instrument to guide patient management in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). From a methodological standpoint, MRD is defined as any approach aimed at detecting and possibly quantifying residual neoplastic cells beyond the sensitivity level of cytomorphology. The molecular methods to study MRD in ALL are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification-based approaches and are the most standardized techniques. However, there are some limitations, and emerging technologies, such as digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), seem to have advantages that could improve MRD analysis in ALL patients. Furthermore, other blood components, namely cell-free DNA (cfDNA), appear promising and are also being investigated for their potential role in monitoring tumor burden and response to treatment in hematologic malignancies. Based on the review of the literature and on our own data, we hereby discuss how emerging molecular technologies are helping to refine the molecular monitoring of MRD in ALL and may help to overcome some of the limitations of standard approaches, providing a benefit for the care of patients.",0
"We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in dose.",1
"Sequential CD19 and CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy offers a promising approach to antigen-loss relapse in relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL); however, research in adults remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential CD19 and CD22 CAR-T cell therapy in adult patients with R/R B-ALL between November 2020 and November 2023 (ChiCTR2100053871). Key endpoints included the adverse event incidence, overall survival (OS), and leukemia-free survival (LFS). Twenty-three patients with a median age of 58.1 years (range 25.9-75.0) were enrolled. High-risk cytogenetic and genomic aberrations were identified in 43.5% of patients, and five patients had baseline extramedullary disease (EMD). The median interval between the two infusions was 3.8 months. Grade ≥ 3 hematological adverse events occurred at comparable rates after both infusions. Cytokine release syndrome was observed in 78.3% and 39.1% of patients after CD19 and CD22 CAR-T therapy, respectively. Two patients experienced grade 2 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) during CD19 CAR-T, and no ICANS was reported during CD22 CAR-T. The median OS was not reached with a median follow-up of 19.4 months (range 8.7-45.6), while the median LFS was 20.8 months. OS and LFS rates were 91.3% and 67.1% at 1 year and 58.6% and 47.0% at 2 years, respectively. Eight patients experienced relapse, with the cumulative incidence of relapse being 28.6% at 1 year and 42.5% at 2 years. Higher baseline leukemia burden (≥ 64% bone marrow blasts) and the presence of EMD were significant risk factors for inferior OS and LFS, respectively. Sequential CAR-T cell therapy demonstrated durable efficacy and a manageable safety profile in R/R B-ALL, providing a viable option to address antigen-loss relapse and improve long-term outcomes in high-risk adult patients.",0
"After childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), sequelae include overweight and obesity, yet with conflicting evidence. We compared the prevalence of overweight and obesity between ≥5-year ALL survivors from the North American Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SCCSS) and described risk factors. We included adult childhood ALL survivors diagnosed between 1976 and 1999. We matched CCSS participants (3:1) to SCCSS participants by sex and attained age. We calculated body mass index (BMI) from self-reported height and weight for 1287 CCSS and 429 SCCSS participants; we then compared those with siblings (2034) in North America and Switzerland (678) siblings. We assessed risk factors for overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m We found overweight and obesity significantly more common among survivors in North America when compared with survivors in Switzerland [overweight: 30%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 27-32 vs. 24%, 21-29; obesity: 29%, 27-32 vs. 7%, 5-10] and siblings (overweight: 30%, 27-32 vs. 25%, 22-29; obesity: 24%, 22-26 vs. 6%, 4-8). Survivors in North America [odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, 1.01-1.53] and Switzerland (1.27, 0.74-2.21) were slightly more often obese than siblings. Among survivors, risk factors for obesity included residency in North America (5.8, 3.7-9.0); male (1.7, 1.3-2.3); attained age (≥45 years: 5.1, 2.4-10.8); Non-Hispanic Black (3.4, 1.6-7.0); low household income (2.3, 1.4-3.5); young age at diagnosis (1.6, 1.1-2.2). Cranial radiotherapy ≥18 Gray was only a risk factor for overweight (1.4, 1.0-1.8); steroids were not associated with overweight or obesity. Interaction tests found no evidence of difference in risk factors between cohorts. Although treatment-related risk for overweight and obesity were similar between regions, higher prevalence among survivors in North America identifies important sociodemographic drivers for informing health policy and targeted intervention trials.",0
"Changes in blackberry ellagitannin composition in response to juicing (clarified and nonclarified), pureeing, canning (in water or syrup), and freezing as well as changes in processed products during 6 months of storage were investigated. Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.",1
"Real-world data on blinatumomab (BLI) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (INO) for relapsed or refractory B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RR-ALL) before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) are limited. To compare the efficacy of salvage therapy with BLI and/or INO and conventional chemotherapy as a bridge to HCT, we retrospectively evaluated patients with RR-ALL who underwent first HCT at our institute between 2004 and 2023. Based on whether they had received salvage therapy with BLI and/or INO, 70 recipients were divided into a BLI/INO (n = 22) and a control group (n = 48). The complete remission (CR) rate before HCT was higher in the BLI/INO group than in the control group (77.3 % vs. 35.4 %, p = 0.002). Two years after the first HCT, the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were significantly higher in the BLI/INO group than in the control group (OS, 63.0 % vs. 31.2 %, p = 0.022; DFS 49.6 % vs. 22.9 %, p = 0.049), with comparable cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 41.3 % vs. 47.9 %; p = 0.767) and lower tendency of non-relapse mortality (NRM, 9.1 % vs. 29.2 %; p = 0.057). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-CR status before HCT was the only factor associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR], 4.263; p < 0.001) and higher CIR (HR, 2.250; p = 0.048). In patients in CR at HCT, there was no difference in HCT outcomes at 2 years (OS, 82.4 % vs. 58.8 %; p = 0.324; DFS, 64.2 % vs. 47.1 %; p = 0.496; CIR, 24.1 % vs. 41.2 %; p = 0.375; NRM, 11.8 % vs. 11.8 %; p = 0.950). BLI and/or INO therapy for RR-ALL was associated with better survival after HCT, probably due to the higher CR rate.",0
"The resveratrol concentrations in 10 white, two pink and nine red wines, and in the skins of ripe and apparently healthy grapes of 16 white- and 20 pink- or red-skinned grape varieties grown in Japan (relatively humid and warm with heavy rainfall in the growing season) were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The resveratrol concentration in skins ranged from 0.5 (Pizzutello Bianco) to 14.1 (Mu11er-Thurgau) µg/g fresh skin, with an average of 4.12µg/g for the 36 skin samples, and that in wines from 1 (Delaware) to 244 (Cabernet Sauvignon) µg/L with an average of 81 µg/L for the 21 wine samples. These values are not markedly different from those in the literature pertaining to other grapegrowing and winemaking regions of the world. The average resveratrol concentration in red wines was about six-fold that in white wines. Little resveratrol (less than 0.01 µg/L) was found in grape juices. The effect of fermentation on the skins (maceration) on the resveratrol contents of wines was investigated. While no increase in resveratrol occurred during fermentation without skins, the resveratrol concentrations increased during fermentation on the skins. The rate of resveratrol extraction from skin to wine differed with grape variety and skin contact time.",1
"Comparative effects of extrusion cooking and conventional processing methods on protein content and reduction of antinutritional factor (phytic acid, condensed tannins, polyphenols, trypsin, chymotrypsin, α-amylase inhibitors and haemagglutinating activity) levels in Vicia faba and Phaseolus vulgaris seeds were studied. In vitro protein and starch digestibilities were assessed. P. vulgaris seeds showed highest levels of condensed tannins, chymotrypsin and α-amylase inhibitory activities and haemagglutinating activity. Dehulling significantly increased protein content and greatly reduced condensed tannin and polyphenol levels in both legumes. Extrusion was the best method to abolish trypsin, chymotrypsin, α-amylase inhibitors and haemagglutinating activity without modifying protein content. Furthermore, this thermal treatment was most effective in improving protein and starch digestibilities when compared with dehulling, soaking and germination.",1
"Rapid separation of a group of eight antioxidants by coelectroosmotic capillary electrophoresis and their preliminary determination in foods (cereal, wine, and beer) is described. The compounds studied were protocatechuic acid, salicylic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and sinapic acid. The best separation was achieved by use of a running buffer consisting of 125 mM boric acid, 49 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.002% (w/v) hexadimethrine bromide, and 2.5 mM α-cyclodextrin, at pH 7.5; the analysis time was less than 3.5 min. Ligration time and peak area reproducibility, studied on the same day (n=4) and on three different days (n=12), showed the method is reproducible. A study of the antioxidant content of cereal, wine, and beer samples was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the method. Antioxidants were extracted from cereal samples by sonication with methanol and from wine and beer samples by solid-phase extraction with C18 cartridges. This preliminary study showed that seven of the eight compounds could be detected in wine and cereal samples whereas only five were detected in beer samples.",1
"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors combined with conventional chemotherapy (CC) in treating Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL) has achieved promising efficacy and safety outcomes. The study was conducted to compare the cost-effectiveness between imatinib (HANSOH Pharma, Jiangsu, China) and dasatinib (CHIATAI TIANQING Pharma, Jiangsu, China) in treating pediatric Ph-positive ALL when combined with CC from the perspective of the health system in China. A Markov model was established to simulate a hypothetical cohort of pediatric Ph-positive ALL patients receiving imatinib or dasatinib, combined with CC. The model was designed using a 10-year horizon, a 3- month cycle, and a 5% discount rate. Three health states were included: alive with progression-free survival, progressed disease, and death. Patient characteristics and transition probabilities were estimated based on clinical trials. Other relevant data, such as direct treatment costs and health utility data were extracted from published literature and Sichuan Province's centralized procurement and supervision platform. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the robustness of the results. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) was set as three times China's GDP per capita in 2021. In the base-case analysis, the total medical costs were $89,701 and $101,182, and the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were 1.99 and 2.70, for imatinib and dasatinib regimens, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for dasatinib versus imatinib was $16,170/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that treatment with dasatinib combined with CC achieved a 96.4% probability of cost-effectiveness at a WTP threshold of $37,765/QALY. Dasatinib combined with CC is likely to be a cost-effective strategy compared to imatinib combination therapy for pediatric Ph-positive ALL in China at a WTP threshold of $37,765/QALY.",0

"The content and composition of dietary fibre (DF), phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers as well as the activity of endogenous enzymes were measured in freeze-dried samples of rye wholemeal, dough and bread during the rye bread-making process. Activities of α-amylase, β-xylosidase, α-arabinofuranosidase, and cinnamoyl esterase(s) were found in extracts of wholemeal and in dough after mixing and proofing, whereas activity of endo-xylanase was only found in the wholemeal. As a result of dough mixing, the content of total DF decreased by 21%, which was caused by a decrease in the amount of water-unextractable (WUE) DF. The content of water-extractable (WE) DF was unchanged during the bread-making process, but the relative content of WE DF increased. The content of total ester-bound phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers decreased from 1575 µg/g in the wholemeal to 1472 µg/g in rye bread. The most pronounced effect occurred in an imitated sour dough (acidified with lactic and acetic acid instead of by lactic acid bacteria). The observed changes in content and solubility of DF in the dough could be explained by the activity of endogenous enzymes and mechanical disaggregation, whereas the changes observed in the imitated sour dough indicated that some acid hydrolysis might also have taken place.",1
"Chromosomal instability (CIN) lies at the core of cancer development leading to aneuploidy, chromosomal copy-number heterogeneity (chr-CNH) and ultimately, unfavorable clinical outcomes. Despite its ubiquity in cancer, the presence of CIN in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cB-ALL), the most frequent pediatric cancer showing high frequencies of aneuploidy, remains unknown. Here, we elucidate the presence of CIN in aneuploid cB-ALL subtypes using single-cell whole-genome sequencing of primary cB-ALL samples and by generating and functionally characterizing patient-derived xenograft models (cB-ALL-PDX). We report higher rates of CIN across aneuploid than in euploid cB-ALL that strongly correlate with intraclonal chr-CNH and overall survival in mice. This association was further supported by in silico mathematical modeling. Moreover, mass-spectrometry analyses of cB-ALL-PDX revealed a ""CIN signature"" enriched in mitotic-spindle regulatory pathways, which was confirmed by RNA-sequencing of a large cohort of cB-ALL samples. The link between the presence of CIN in aneuploid cB-ALL and disease progression opens new possibilities for patient stratification and offers a promising new avenue as a therapeutic target in cB-ALL treatment.",0
"The occurrence of biophenolic components in olives provides functional value to the Mediterranean food culture, owing to recognized antioxidant activities of these substances. The concentration of biophenolic compounds in olives are closely linked to texture and organoleptic characteristics of agrifood products, i.e. table olive and olive oil. The concentrations of different biophenolic compounds in olives were investigated in order to develop appropriate procedures for determination of these compounds in fresh and processed table olives and in the olive drupes for olive oil production. Olives from Spain (Hojiblanca cv), Portugal (Douro cv), Greece (Thasos and Conservolia cvs) and Italy (Taggiasca and Cassanese cvs) were analysed. Four different protocols were employed. The first allows for an estimate of the total concentration of simple biophenolic compounds; the second, for soluble compounds and soluble esterified derivatives of these compounds; the third, the qualitative determination of cytoplasmatic soluble biophenolic content; the fourth, determination of soluble, glucosidic, esterified and cell-wall bound biophenols by means of a rapid, though more complex, sequential method, for their accurate evaluation on a structural and quantitative basis. Thus, the experimental procedures yield four different fractions of the biophenolic components of the olive, checked by CC, HPLC and NMR. The experimental results depend on the procedure chosen, the degree of ripeness of the olives, and the environment of the olive cultivars. The composition of each of these fractions can be of valuable information, supporting for table olive growing and olive oil producers in maximising the competitive quality of their products by selecting olive materials whose concentrations of biophenolic compounds can be responsible for beneficial effects on human health.",1
"We present a method for the quantitative determination of the phytoestrogens formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol and simultaneously the lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and matairesinol in plant-derived foods. These compounds are measured by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode (ID/GC/MS/SIM) using synthesized deuterated internal standards for the correction of losses during the procedure. A three-step hydrolysis--a rehydration with distilled H2O, followed by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis--has been applied in order to convert the diphenolic glycosides into their respective aglycones. Purification and separation are carried out in two ion-exchange chromatographic steps followed by derivatization and GC-MS. The within-assay imprecision values vary 3.1-9.6% and the between-assay imprecision 7.0-21.2%. The mean recovery of authentic standards processed through the whole procedure varied from 95.5 to 105.5%. Values for some different food samples are presented. The simultaneous determination of the biologically most interesting phytoestrogens and lignans in foods has not been carried out previously and the method will be useful for screening of important foods in populations with different risk of cancer and coronary heart disease, and for metabolic studies.",1
"The results of a study on the evolution of physicochemical parameters during processing of black olives, with particular emphasis on anthocyanins and colour, are reported. Olives of two cultivars collected at a technological black-ripe stage were processed by the traditional anaerobic system. At regular intervals, brines and olives were inspected for different parameters. The routine physicochemical values in brines and olives changed as expected. Total anthocyanin, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside content showed a rapid decrease at 15 days of processing, presenting apparently a zero-order kinetic, and later they completely disappeared. Chromatograms revealed other unidentified peaks. The colour stability of the olives was probably assured by the formation of new more stable pigments.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous clonal disease originated from B- or T-cell lymphoid precursor cells. ALL is often refractory or relapses after treatment. Novel treatments are anxiously needed in order to achieve a better response and prolonged overall survival in ALL patients. In the present study, we aimed at examining the antitumor effect of niclosamide on ALL. We investigated the effects of niclosamide on the proliferation and apoptosis in vitro, the growth of ALL cells in xenografted NOD-Prkdcem26Cd52 il2rgem26Cd22 /Nju (NCG) mice. The results showed that niclosamide treatment potently inhibited the growth of ALL cells and induced apoptosis via elevating the levels of reactive oxygen species and activating TP53. These findings suggest that niclosamide may be a promisingly potential agent for ALL therapy.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematopoietic neoplasm resulting from the malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors. While activating NOTCH1 mutations are the dominant genetic drivers of T-ALL, epigenetic dysfunction plays a central role in the pathology of T-ALL and can provide alternative mechanisms to oncogenesis in lieu of or in combination with genetic mutations. The histone demethylase enzyme KDM6A (UTX) is also recurrently mutated in T-ALL patients and functions as a tumor suppressor. However, its gene paralog, KDM6B (JMJD3), is never mutated and can be significantly overexpressed, suggesting it may be necessary for sustaining the disease. Here, we used mouse and human T-ALL models to show that KDM6B is required for T-ALL development and maintenance. Using NOTCH1 gain-of-function retroviral models, mouse cells genetically deficient for Kdm6b were unable to propagate T-ALL. Inactivating KDM6B in human T-ALL patient cells by CRISPR/Cas9 showed KDM6B-targeted cells were significantly outcompeted over time. The dependence of T-ALL cells on KDM6B was proportional to the oncogenic strength of NOTCH1 mutation, with KDM6B required to prevent stress-induced apoptosis from strong NOTCH1 signaling. These studies identify a crucial role for KDM6B in sustaining NOTCH1-driven T-ALL and implicate KDM6B as a novel therapeutic target in these patients.",0
"Variations in the TP53 and KRAS genes indicate a particularly adverse prognosis in relapsed pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We hypothesized that these variations might be subclonally present at disease onset and contribute to relapse risk. To test this, we examined 2 cohorts of children diagnosed with T-ALL: cohort 1 with 81 patients who relapsed and 79 who matched nonrelapsing controls, and cohort 2 with 226 consecutive patients, 30 of whom relapsed. In cohort 1, targeted sequencing revealed TP53 clonal and subclonal variants in 6 of 81 relapsing patients but none in the nonrelapsing group (P = .014). KRAS alterations were found in 9 of 81 relapsing patients compared with 2 of 79 nonrelapsing patients (P = .032). Survival analysis showed that none of the relapsed patients with TP53 and/or KRAS alterations survived, whereas 19 of 67 relapsed patients without such variants did, with a minimum follow-up time of 3 years (P = .023). In cohort 2, none of the relapsing patients but 10 of 196 nonrelapsing patients carried TP53 or KRAS variants, indicating that mutation status alone does not predict poor prognosis. All 10 nonrelapsing patients with mutations had a favorable early treatment response. Among the total cohort of 386 patients, 188 showed poor treatment response, of whom 69 relapsed. Of these poor responders, 9 harbored TP53 or KRAS variants. In conclusion, subclonal TP53 and KRAS alterations identified at the time of initial diagnosis, along with a poor treatment response, characterize a subset of children with T-ALL who face a dismal prognosis and who may benefit from alternative treatment approaches.",0
"Whereas the prognosis of adult patients with Philadelphia-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has greatly improved since the advent of pediatric-inspired regimens, the impact of initial central nervous system (CNS) involvement has not been formerly re-evaluated. We report here the outcome of patients with initial CNS involvement included in the pediatric-inspired prospective randomized GRAALL-2005 study. Between 2006 and 2014, 784 adult patients (aged 18-59 years) with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-negative ALL were included, of whom 55 (7%) had CNS involvement. In CNSpositive patients, overall survival was shorter (median 1.9 years vs. not reached, HR=1.8 [1.3-2.6], P<0.001). While there was no statistical difference in cumulative incidence of relapse between CNS+ and CNS- patients (HR=1.5 [0.9-2.5], P=0.11), non-relapse mortality was significantly higher in those with initial CNS disease (HR=2.1 [1.2-3.5], P=0.01). This increase in toxicity was mostly observed in patients randomized to the high-dose cyclophosphamide arm and in those who received allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Exploratory landmark analyses did not show any association between either cranial irradiation or allogeneic stem cell transplantation and outcome. Despite improved outcome in young adult ALL patients with pediatric-inspired protocols, CNS involvement is associated with a worse outcome mainly due to excess toxicity, without improved outcome with allogeneic SCT.",0
"Fatty acid composition, total phenols, phenolic and volatile profile data are presented for cold-pressed and refined camellia oil, in comparison to other commercially available oils – avocado, pumpkin, sesame and soybean – representing a cross-section of bulk, “bland” oils (e.g., soybean) through to more boutique oils consumed primarily for taste (e.g., pumpkin). Camellia oil has a high oleic acid content, low polyunsaturated acid content, and levels of endogenous phenols comparable, in quantity and diversity, to cold-pressed oils. Volatile profiles of camellia oil are also comparable to cold-pressed oils, in that alkanals are the dominant headspace compounds, as measured by solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography. These factors suggest that camellia oil may find much wider commercial acceptance outside its current market range, southern China.",1
"Many hematologic malignancies are not curable with chemotherapy and require novel therapeutic approaches. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is 1 such approach that involves the transfer of T cells engineered to express CARs for a specific cell-surface antigen. CD38 is a validated tumor antigen in multiple myeloma (MM) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and is also overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we developed human CD38-redirected T cells (CART-38) as a unified approach to treat 3 different hematologic malignancies that occur across the pediatric-to-adult age spectrum. Importantly, CD38 expression on activated T cells did not impair CART-38 cells expansion or in vitro function. In xenografted mice, CART-38 mediated the rejection of AML, T-ALL, and MM cell lines and primary samples and prolonged survival. In a xenograft model of normal human hematopoiesis, CART-38 resulted in the expected reduction of hematopoietic progenitors, which warrants caution and careful monitoring of this potential toxicity when translating this new immunotherapy into the clinic. Deploying CART-38 against multiple CD38-expressing malignancies is significant because it expands the potential for this novel therapy to affect diverse patient populations.",0
"Disease relapse remains the first cause of mortality of hematological malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia (AML and ALL) and for myelodysplastic syndroms (MDS). More and more patients are eligible for allo-HCT over the years and for many of them, only reduced intensity conditioning is possible, which is associated with a higher risk of relapse. Knowledge and biotechnology allow us to better identify diseases at very high risk of relapse and to measure residual disease before allo-HCT. Planning post-transplant maintenance treatment as part of a prophylaxis strategy is now feasible. Monitoring biomarkers of residual disease and post-transplant chimerism after allo-HCT allows a preemptive strategy. Within the frame of the 14th annual workshops of the Francophone Society for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell Therapy, the working group reviewed the literature and discussed novel strategies and therapies used to prevent relapse post-allo-HCT. Innovative drugs have been developed recently. Their toxicity profile allows their use post-allo-HCT, albeit with precaution. We reviewed the use of FLT3 inhibitors for AML, BCR::ABL inhibitors for Philadelphia chromosome for ALL, hypomethylating agents and Bcl-2 inhibitors for AML and MDS. The indications of immunomodulation and infusion of donor lymphocytes have been reviewed. Finally, we outlined methods of follow-up and support for patients receiving these prophylactic treatments.",0

"CD19 is frequently targeted for immunotherapy in B cell malignancies, which may result in loss of CD19 expression in leukemic cells as an escape mechanism. Stage 0 hematogones (Hgs) are normal CD19-negative very early B cell precursors that can be potentially mistaken for CD19 negative residual leukemic cells by flow cytometry (FCM) in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cases treated with anti CD19 therapy. Our main objective was to characterize and study the incidence of stage 0 hematogones in follow-up bone marrow samples of pediatric BCP-ALL cases. We analyzed the flow cytometry standard files of 61 pediatric BCP-ALL cases treated with conventional chemotherapy and targeted anti-CD19 therapy, for identifying the residual disease and normal B cell precursors including stage 0 Hgs. A non-CD19 alternate gating strategy was used to isolate the B cells for detecting the residual disease and stage 0 Hgs. The stage 0 Hgs were seen in 95% of marrow samples containing CD19+ Hgs. When compared with controls and posttransplant marrow samples, the fraction of stage 0 Hgs was higher in patients receiving anti CD19 therapy (p = 0.0048), but it was not significant when compared with patients receiving chemotherapy (p = 0.1788). Isolated stage 0 Hgs are found in samples treated with anti-CD19 therapy simulating CD19 negative residual illness. Our findings aid in understanding the stage 0 Hgs and its association with CD19+ Hgs in anti CD19 therapy and conventional chemotherapy. This is crucial as it can be potentially mistaken for residual disease in patients treated with anti CD19 therapy.",0
"CD47 is overexpressed on the surface of many types of cancer cells, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. In this study, we have developed a diphtheria toxin (DT)-based bivalent anti-human CD47 immunotoxin (bi-CD47-IT) for the targeted therapy of CD47+ cancers using a unique DT-resistant yeast Pichia pastoris expression system. Bi-CD47-IT demonstrated compelling in vivo efficacy in multiple T-ALL cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Bi-CD47-IT significantly prolonged the median survival of the tumor-bearing mice and highly effectively depleted the T-ALL blast cells in the peripheral blood, spleen, liver, bone marrow, brain, and spinal cord in the T-ALL CDX and PDX mouse models. Bi-CD47-IT cured 60% of tumor-bearing mice in a T-ALL Molt-4 CDX mouse model. Because CD47 is also expressed on normal tissues, including red blood cells and lymphocytes, specificity is a concern. We thus analyzed the in vitro binding avidity and hemagglutination of bi-CD47-IT in human red blood cells, finding no binding or hemagglutination. We further performed a toxicity study of bi-CD47-IT in humanized mice, which showed that bi-CD47-IT transiently depleted the human lymphocytes for ∼4 weeks after the 10-day treatment. No clinical adverse events were observed. As a result, bi-CD47-IT appears to possess the ""optimal"" binding avidity, with effective binding to human CD47+ T-ALL tumor cells, no binding to human red blood cells, and weak binding to human lymphocytes. We believe that bi-CD47-IT is a promising and safe therapeutic drug candidate for the targeted therapy of CD47+ cancers.",0
"The effects of the toasting process on the carbohydrate profile and antioxidant properties of chickpea flour were studied, along with the cooking behaviour, and antioxidant and nutritional properties of pasta enriched with the chickpea flour. The toasting process increased the resistant starch, insoluble dietary fibre and antioxidant properties of the flour. Addition of chickpea flour (raw and toasted) to durum wheat semolina changed the carbohydrate profile in the uncooked and cooked enriched pasta, especially with the toasted chickpea, and worsened the overall quality of the pasta. The increase in total phenolic content and total free phenolic acid content in the uncooked pasta was due to positive effects of addition of the chickpea flours, while the increase in the bound phenolics fraction in the cooked pasta was from the durum wheat, which was crucial for its high concentrations of ferulic acid. The increase in the free fraction of the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity in cooked pasta was consistent with the addition of chickpea.",1
"The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial sources.",1
"Maintaining the efficacy of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor modified (CAR) T-cell therapy in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) is an urgent problem. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of donor hematopoietic stem cell infusion (DSI) therapy and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) therapy as a maintenance therapy after R/R B-ALL patients achieved CR in anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy but relapsed after allo-HSCT. In total, 22 B-ALL patients who relapsed after allo-HSCT received anti-CD19-CAR T-cell therapy. Patients who responded to CAR T-cell therapy received DSI or DLI as maintenance therapy. We compared the clinical responses, acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), expansion of CAR-T-cells, and adverse events between the two groups. In our study, 19 patients received DSI/DLI as maintenance therapy. After DSI/DLI therapy, progression-free survival and overall survival were higher in the DSI group than in the DLI group at 365 days. The grades I and II of aGVHD was observed in four patients (36.4%) in the DSI group. Only one patient developed grade II aGVHD in the DLI group. The peaks of CAR T-cells in the DSI group were higher than those in the DLI group. IL-6 and TNF-α levels increased again in nine of 11 patients after DSI but not in the DLI group. Our findings indicate that for B-ALL patients who relapse after allo-HSCT, DSI is a feasible maintenance therapy if CR is obtained with CAR-T-cell therapy.",0
"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for about 75% of childhood leukemia cases, and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) accounts for more than 80% of childhood ALL cases. Over the past half century, new molecular biological targets discovered by new techniques have been used in precise stratification of disease prognosis, and there has been a gradual increase in the 5-year overall survival rate of childhood ALL. With the increasing attention to long-term quality of life, the treatment of childhood B-ALL has been constantly optimized from induction therapy to the intensity of maintenance therapy, including the treatment of extramedullary leukemia without radiotherapy, which has been tried with successful results. The realization of optimized treatment also benefits from the development of new techniques associated with immunology and molecular biology and the establishment of standardized clinical cohorts and corresponding biobanks. This article summarizes the relevant research on the implementation of precise stratification and the intensity reduction and optimization treatment of B-ALL in recent years, providing reference for clinicians. 儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病约占整体儿童白血病的75%，其中，急性B淋巴细胞白血病占儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病的80%以上。半个世纪以来，利用新技术不断发现新的分子生物靶标并用于精准的疾病预后分层，儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病的5年总生存率逐年提高。随着对远期生活质量的关注日益增强，儿童急性B淋巴细胞白血病的治疗从诱导治疗到维持治疗强度在不断优化，包括髓外白血病治疗去除放疗也有尝试，并获得成功。优化治疗的实现也得益于免疫学、分子生物学相关新技术的发展、规范化临床队列及与之相应的生物样本库建立。该文对近年来精准分层的实施及急性B淋巴细胞白血病降低强度优化治疗的相关研究进行梳理总结，为临床医生提供参考。.",0
"Gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 are among the most frequent genetic alterations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), highlighting the Notch signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic target for personalized medicine. Yet, a major limitation for long-term success of targeted therapy is relapse due to tumor heterogeneity or acquired resistance. Thus, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to identify prospective resistance mechanisms to pharmacological NOTCH inhibitors and novel targeted combination therapies to efficiently combat T-ALL. Mutational loss of phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) causes resistance to Notch inhibition. PIK3R1 deficiency leads to increased PI3K/AKT signaling, which regulates cell cycle and the spliceosome machinery, both at the transcriptional and posttranslational level. Moreover, several therapeutic combinations have been identified, in which simultaneous targeting of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) and NOTCH proved to be the most efficacious in T-ALL xenotransplantation models.",0
"The most common complications related to the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are infections. The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence and mortality rates among pediatric patients with ALL who were treated in 17 Polish pediatric hematology centers in 2020-2021 during the pandemic. Additionally, we compared these results with those of our previous study, which we conducted in the years 2012-2017. The retrospective analysis included 460 patients aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed ALL. In our study, 361/460 (78.5%) children were reported to have microbiologically documented bacterial infections during chemotherapy. Ten patients (2.8%) died due to sepsis. Fungal infections were reported in 99 children (21.5%), of whom five (5.1%) died due to the infection. We especially observed an increase in bacterial infections during the pandemic period compared to the previous study. The directions of our actions should be to consider antibiotic prophylaxis, shorten the duration of hospitalization, and educate parents and medical staff about complications (mainly infections) during anticancer therapy. It is necessary to continue clinical studies evaluating infection prophylaxis to improve outcomes in childhood ALL patients.",0
"This study aims to define and cluster tennis match types based on how they are played. The research data selected for this study were from the 100th round of 32 matches of the five finals of the 2023 International Tennis Open Tournament. Based on expert knowledge and sports expertise, 27 variables were included across seven areas. Three models were applied and the silhouette coefficient was calculated to identify the optimal number of clusters. A difference test was conducted on the game record variables based on the cluster results. Calculation of the silhouette coefficients for the three models showed that Model 3 (silhouette coefficient: 0.406) had the highest performance. The clustering results for the tennis match types are as follows. First, the NEt Rusher Defensive type, which is defensive and induces net play. Second, the ALl Courter Defensive type, which is either defensive or all-round. Third, the STroke Placement Offensive type, which is aggressive and has strengths in stroke. Fourth, the SErve Placement Offensive type, which is aggressive and has strengths in sub courses. This study's findings are not only provide basic data to cluster game types in tennis matches but also to contribute to establishing game strategies for each game type, thereby further improving performance.",0
"Increasing evidence highlights the important role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL). Our study aimed to stratify B-ALL based on immune signatures, thus helping to clinically predict prognosis and guide treatment. Two cohorts of pediatric B-ALLs were included in this study, one from the GEO database (n = 136) was used to establish consensus clustering algorithm to stratify B-ALLs based on immune-related genes (IRGs), and the other from our cohort (n = 73) was used to validate the universality of established clustering algorithm. To elucidate the characteristics of each subtype, the prognosis, immune features, clinical information and genetic abnormalities were explored. Based on the expression of 1315 IRGs, B-ALLs were classified into five distinct immune subtypes. Cluster1 had the favorable prognosis while cluster 2-5 had relatively unfavorable prognosis. Cluster 1 was strongly associated with clinical information indicative of a favorable prognosis [e.g. low white blood count (WBC) level] relative to cluster 2-5. In term of immune features, cluster 5 were characterized by high expression of multiple immune checkpoint genes [e.g. B and T lymphocyte attenuator ( Our study identified five immune subtypes that associated with distinct biological aberrations and clinical behaviors, which help us better understand the heterogeneity of TME and may provide valuable information for the precision therapy of pediatric B-ALL.",0
"Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.",1
"B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) is a malignant hematological disorder marked by the aberrant proliferation of abnormal B lymphocytes. Although recent advancements have highlighted the pivotal role of ribosomes in the progression of B-ALL, the specific function of ribosomal protein L9 (RPL9), a key component of ribosomal structural protein, still unclear. In this study, we observed a significant upregulation of RPL9 in human B-ALL cells compared to normal B cells, suggesting RPL9's potential key role in B-ALL progression. Enforced RPL9 knockdown (KD) led to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in B-ALL cells compared to the control group. Furthermore, RPL9 KD significantly extended the survival time of NCG mice bearing B-ALL cells",0
"Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.",1
"T-cell haematological malignancies progress rapidly and have a high mortality rate and effective treatments are still lacking. Here, we developed a drug delivery system utilizing 293T cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) modified with an anti-CD7 single-chain variable fragment (αCD7/EVs). Given the challenges of chemotherapy resistance in patients with T-cell malignancy, we selected cytochrome C (CytC) and Bcl2 siRNA (siBcl2) as therapeutic agents and loaded them into αCD7/EVs (αCD7/EVs/CytC/siBcl2). We found that αCD7/EVs efficiently targeted and were internalized by human T-ALL Molt-4 cells. In addition, the interaction between αCD7 and CD7 switched the EV entry pathway in Molt-4 cells from macropinocytosis-dependent endocytosis to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, thereby reducing EV-lysosome colocalization, ultimately improving CytC delivery efficiency and increasing the cytotoxicity of nascent EVs from EV-treated Molt-4 cells. Notably, αCD7/EVs/CytC/siBcl2 demonstrated similar efficacy against both Molt-4 and chemotherapy-resistant Molt-4 cells (CR-Molt-4). Furthermore, αCD7/EVs/CytC/siBcl2 exhibited high safety, low immunogenicity and minimal impact on human T cells. Therefore, αCD7/EVs/CytC/siBcl2 are promising therapeutic approaches for treating CD7",0
"Dexamethasone, the preferred corticosteroid in most treatment protocols for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), can induce undesirable side effects. Neurobehavioral and sleep problems are frequently reported, but the interpatient variability is high. We therefore aimed to identify determinants for parent-reported dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral and sleep problems in pediatric ALL. Our prospective study included patients with medium-risk ALL and their parents during maintenance treatment. Patients were assessed before and after one 5-day dexamethasone course. Primary end points were parent-reported dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral and sleep problems, measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children, respectively. Analyzed determinants included patient and parent demographics, disease and treatment characteristics, parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index and Distress Thermometer for Parents), dexamethasone pharmacokinetics, and genetic variation (candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms We included 105 patients: median age was 5.4 years (range, 3.0-18.8) and 61% were boys. Clinically relevant dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral and sleep problems were reported by parents in 70 (67%) and 61 (59%) patients, respectively. In our multivariable regression models, we identified parenting stress as a significant determinant for parent-reported neurobehavioral (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.26) and sleep problems (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.10). Furthermore, parents who experienced more stress before start of a dexamethasone course reported more sleep problems in their child (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.32). We identified parenting stress, and not dexamethasone pharmacokinetics, genetic variation, patient/parent demographics, or disease/treatment characteristics, as a significant determinant for parent-reported dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral and sleep problems. Parenting stress may be a modifiable target to reduce these problems.",0
Viral infections pose a significant global burden. Host susceptibility to pathogens is determined by many factors including genetic variation that can lead to immunodeficient or dysregulated antiviral immune responses. Pax5 heterozygosity (Pax5,0
"Sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) cv. Vergasa have been studied at four maturity stages (immature green, green, immature red, and red). The individual phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.",1
"Allocryptopine (ALL), a principal active component of the novel veterinary medicine Bopu Powder®, has gained widespread application in the poultry farming sector for the effective management of Escherichia coli (E. coli) diarrhea. In order to explore the metabolites and the pivotal enzymes associated with ALL, this study was conducted employing an in vitro chicken liver microsomal incubation. The metabolites of ALL were analyzed and identified by combining isotope tracing technology with the application of mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns. The key metabolic enzymes involved in the biotransformation of ALL were explored using the CYP450 recombinant enzyme method, which facilitated the identification of the enzymes contributing to ALL's metabolic pathway. The liver microsomal metabolism investigation revealed a total of five metabolites, with the predominant being M2 (harmol or 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,7,8,15-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4',5':4,5]benzo[1,2-g]benzo[c]azecin-14(6 H)-one). The recombinant enzyme analysis conclusively identified CYP2D6 as the pivotal CYP450 isoenzyme that plays a central role in the metabolic pathway of the principal ALL metabolite, M2. This research not only expands our comprehension of the biotransformation process of ALL but also provides significant scientific evidence for the clinical safety of ALL, which was of great importance for guiding the application of ALL in the field of veterinary medicine.",0
"The death rate of hematological malignancies is high, and the death rate of patients with COVID-19 infection is further increased. Although there have been expert consensus and relevant guidelines to introduce the recommendations of the guidelines for patients with hematological malignancies complicated with COVID-19 infection, there is limited understanding of the clinical characteristics of Chinese patients with acute leukemia complicated with COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to analyze the clinical manifestations, mortality, and determinants of viral shedding duration in Chinese AL patients infected with COVID-19. We conducted a retrospective study of 100 AL patients with COVID-19 infection in Henan Province, China, from December 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023. Data on demographics, leukemia subtype, symptoms, treatments (antibiotics/antivirals), and viral shedding duration were collected. Follow-up was conducted over three months to assess mortality. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors. The median age was 49.5 years (58% male, 42% female), with 76% having acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 24% acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Most patients (86%) were asymptomatic. Antibiotics and antivirals were administered to 35% and 25% of patients, respectively. Severe cases and fatalities exhibited prolonged viral shedding. Neutropenic patients on antibiotics had significantly extended shedding duration, whereas antiviral therapy or delayed primary disease management shortened it. The overall mortality rate was 6%. Univariate analysis identified neutropenia as a key mortality risk factor, though multivariate analysis showed no significant associations. Early antiviral treatment may reduce viral shedding duration and potentially mitigate symptom severity and mortality in AL patients with COVID-19. Neutropenia emerged as a critical factor influencing outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of tailored therapeutic strategies for this high-risk population.",0
"The purpose of this study was to examine the reduced and oxidized glutathione status of selected cereal grains as a potential index of balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant systems, and the contribution of reduced glutathione to the total antioxidant status in cereal grain extracts. Wheat cultivars Almari and Henika, barley cultivars Gregor and Mobek, rye cultivar Dañkowskie Złote, oat cultivar Sławko, and buckwheat cultivar Kora were used. Total antioxidant status (TAS) was measured by the ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate)) method. Contents of total phenolic compounds were also determined. Reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) were assayed using the spectrofluorimetric method, and results were confirmed by the enzyme recycling method. Correlation coefficient for the GSH/GSSG ratio was r = 0.79. Correlation between TAS and the total phenolic compound content was r = 0.81. Correlation between GSH/GSSG ratio and TAS values was r= 0.46, depending on the extraction system used. The GSH/GSSG ratio may indicate a hierarchy among different cultivars and variance of cereal grains against damage caused by reactive oxygen species. For the main water-soluble antioxidants, our data indicate a potential hierarchy of resistance in investigated cereals against oxidative stress (buckwheat > wheat > barley ≈ rye > oat). This hierarchy was confirmed by the ability of investigated cereal extracts to scavenge superoxide anion radicals in vitro. The reduced-oxidized glutathione status in different cereal grains can be applied as a potential index of balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant systems.",1
"Lactuca sativa L. plants (cv. Audran) developed in greenhouse or in open air, were analysed for their polyphenol compounds (caffeic acid derivatives, quercetin and kaempferol glycosides) to verify whether these two different growing environments affected both the qualitative and quantitative phenol patterns. The lettuce extracts from greenhouse and open-air samples were compared and directly analysed by HPLC/DAD, HPLC/MS and HPTLC. All open-air samples had higher flavonol contents than the greenhouse ones. The applied rapid and sensitive HPTLC method could be routinely employed to determine the leaf flavonol content of a large number of lettuce samples.",1

"There is strong evidence that the lignan precursors from vegetable material, secoisolariciresinol (seco) and matairesinol (mata), are major sources to support the development of lignans in the mammalian colon. Recent studies have shown these active agents to have anticancer properties, especially for mammary or prostatic carcinomas. Linseed is currently by far the best-known source of seco and mata. To support the development of a food supplement, cultivars of linseed were tested at two sites and under increasing nitrogen supply to investigate how the lignan content is affected. The results indicated that the nitrogen supply did not affect the content of seco and mata at either site. A significant difference in seed yield could be measured between the sites, but the overall lignan content - even though significant - was less affected. The main effects were relatively similar at both sites and derived from the cultivars, indicating that the lignan content is very much dependent on genetic predisposition.",1
"The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the influence of chemotherapy on the immune status of individual patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to elucidate the clinical characteristics of immune reconstitution in ALL patients following chemotherapy. Clinical data of children with ALL were gathered, including information on the number of lymphocyte subsets prior to chemotherapy, at the end of therapy, six months, and one year after the end of the treatment. A total of 146 children with ALL were included, and T cells, B cells, and NK cells all decreased to various degrees prior to treatment. The abnormal CD3 + T cell numbers group experienced a considerably higher mortality (21.9% vs. 6.1%) and recurrence rate (31.3% vs. 11.4%) compared to the normal group (P < 0.05). T cells, B cells, and NK cells were all significantly compromised at the end of therapy compared to the beginning of chemotherapy, with B cells being more severely compromised (P < 0.001). At the end of treatment, levels of B cells, CD4 + T cells, CD4/CD8, IgG and IgM in low risk (LR) group were significantly higher than those in intermediate risk (IR) group (P < 0.01), and levels of NK cells in LR group were evidently lower than those in IR group (P < 0.001). Six months after the end of therapy, all the above indicators recovered (P < 0.001) except CD4/CD8 ratio (P = 0.451). The immune systems of the ALL patients were severely compromised upon therapy withdrawal, particularly the B cells. At six months after the therapy ended, the B cells were basically restored to normal level, while the T-cell compartment was not. The impaired numbers of CD3 + T cell may contribute to a weakened anti-tumor response, potentially leading to a poorer prognosis.",0

"Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites (ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.",1
"The etiology of pediatric acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) is still unclear. Whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing of bone marrow samples in patients with treatment-naïve ALL (n=6) was performed for untargeted investigation of bacterial and viral DNA. The control group consisted of healthy children (n=4) and children with non-oncologic diseases (n=2) undergoing bone marrow sampling. Peripheral blood of all participants was investigated at the same time. After bioinformatical elimination of potential contaminants by comparison with the employed controls, no significant amounts of microbial or viral DNA were identified.",0
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of the Notch signaling pathway, influencing diverse pathological processes ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative disorders. This review synthesizes evidence demonstrating how circRNAs modulate Notch activity through miRNA sponging (e.g., circ-NOTCH 1 promoting gastric cancer metastasis via miR-637/apelin axis), protein interactions, and peptide encoding. Key examples of oncogenic circRNAs are circNFIX (glioma) and circ-ASH2L (pancreatic cancer), which drive tumor progression by sponging miR-34a-5p, elevating NOTCH 1 expression, and activating downstream effectors. We also discuss tissue-specific duality of circRNAs. In fact, Notch signaling exhibits context-dependent roles, with circFBXW7 suppressing NOTCH 1 in T-ALL (tumor suppressor) versus circ-NSD2 activating JAG1/NOTCH 1 in colorectal cancer (oncogene). While circRNAs like hsa_circ_0001741 show prognostic promise, challenges persist in delivery and target specificity due to miRNA pleiotropy. By integrating mechanistic insights with preclinical examples, this review highlights circRNAs as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets, urging further research to address clinical translation barriers.",0
"Interleukin-7 (IL-7) supports the growth and chemoresistance of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), particularly the early T-cell precursor subtype (ETP-ALL), which frequently has activating mutations of IL-7 signaling. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT5) is an attractive therapeutic target because it is almost universally activated in ETP-ALL, even in the absence of mutations of upstream activators such as the IL-7 receptor (IL-7R), Janus kinase, and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). To examine the role of activated STAT5 in ETP-ALL, we have used a Lmo2-transgenic (Lmo2Tg) mouse model in which we can monitor chemoresistant preleukemia stem cells (pre-LSCs) and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) that drive T-ALL development and relapse following chemotherapy. Using IL-7R-deficient Lmo2Tg mice, we show that IL-7 signaling was not required for the formation of pre-LSCs but essential for their expansion and clonal evolution into LSCs to generate T-ALL. Activated STAT5B was sufficient for the development of T-ALL in IL-7R-deficient Lmo2Tg mice, indicating that inhibition of STAT5 is required to block the supportive signals provided by IL-7. To further understand the role of activated STAT5 in LSCs of ETP-ALL, we developed a new transgenic mouse that enables T-cell specific and doxycycline-inducible expression of the constitutively activated STAT5B1∗6 mutant. Expression of STAT5B1∗6 in T cells had no effect alone but promoted expansion and chemoresistance of LSCs in Lmo2Tg mice. Pharmacologic inhibition of STAT5 with pimozide-induced differentiation and loss of LSCs, while enhancing response to chemotherapy. Furthermore, pimozide significantly reduced leukemia burden in vivo and overcame chemoresistance of patient-derived ETP-ALL xenografts. Overall, our results demonstrate that STAT5 is an attractive therapeutic target for eradicating LSCs in ETP-ALL.",0
The major phenolic compounds and the polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity in various peach cultivars grown in New York during the 1987 and 1988 seasons were studied to correlate them with the degree of browning. The concentration of individual phenolic compounds decreased steadily during maturation and remained low until harvest time. PPO activity followed a pattern similar to that of the phenolics during ripening. Large seasonal and cultivar variations in certain phenolic compounds and PPO activity were observed. The degree of browning closely correlated with the phenolic content and enzyme activity.,1
"We aimed to investigate the application of CD34 detection in immunophenotypic discrimination and its prognostic relevance in children with acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical follow-up data of 105 children with newly diagnosed B-ALL treated at our hospital from January 2022 to December 2023. Based on the expression of CD34 in the bone marrow, patients were divided into a CD34 positive group (positive cells ≥10%) and a CD34 negative group (positive cells <10%). The study compared the positive rates of common leukemia cell antigens, clinical characteristics, initial treatment responses, and long-term follow-up outcomes between the two groups. Among all 105 B-ALL cases, 87 children (82.9%) had bone marrow CD34 positive cells ≥10%, classified into the CD34 positive group, while the remaining 18 children (17.1%) had bone marrow CD34 positive cells <10%, classified into the CD34 negative group. The CD34 positive group exhibited significantly higher positive rates of CD13 expression, standard-risk B-ALL, and risk stratification than the CD34 negative group. In contrast, the proportions of early pre-B-ALL, E2A-PBX1 fusion gene, and MLL-AF4 fusion gene were significantly lower in the CD34 negative group, with statistically significant differences (p<0.05). No significant differences were found in the positive rates of leukemia cell antigens such as CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, CD13, CD33, and CD38 between the two groups (p>0.05). The occurrence rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) and relapse after induction chemotherapy in the CD34 positive group were significantly lower than those in the CD34 negative group (p<0.05). However, the sensitivity to the first prednisone treatment and bone marrow treatment efficacy on the 19th and 33rd days after chemotherapy showed no significant differences between the groups (p>0.05). A higher positive rate of bone marrow CD34 expression in children with B-ALL is associated with a favorable prognosis. Children with negative CD34 expression are relatively more prone to MRD and tumor relapse after chemotherapy.",0
"To highlight the occurrence of premature ovarian insufficiency in pediatric cancer patients and determine which patient characteristics or treatment modalities are associated with ovarian failure and recovery. Between August 2011-August 2021, 36 of 2,661 patients with cancer were identified to have subsequent ovarian failure. Data collected included cancer type, diagnosis age, types of chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant or radiation treatment, peak follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), peak anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) treatment, type of hormone replacement therapy, and if ovarian function recovery occurred. The most common cancer type identified was ALL. The mean age of diagnosis was 8.5±4.3 years and mean age of peak FSH value was 12.6±2.8 years. Most patients (97.2 %) were treated with alkylating agents and 72.2 % received radiation. Most patients (72.2 %) received hormone therapy, and 15.8 % of patients received GnRHa Lupron. Ten patients (27.8 %) had ovarian function recovery. Diagnosis age and treatment type were recovery predictors in multivariate regression modeling. Each year older in age was associated with a 30 % decrease in odds of recovery (OR: 0.7, CI: 0.5-0.95, p=0.035), and alkylating agent treatment without transplant was associated with a 3-fold increase in odds of recovery (OR: 3, CI: 2.7-564, p=0.007). This retrospective review demonstrates that POI can occur in pediatric cancer survivors, emphasizing the importance of educating patients on potential long-term effects of cancer treatment and importance of routine surveillance. This study confirmed that recovery of ovarian function is possible, especially when diagnosed at a younger age, making continued monitoring essential.",0
"Recognition of aberrant gene isoforms due to DNA events can impact risk stratification and molecular classification of hematolymphoid tumors. In myelodysplastic syndromes, KMT2A partial tandem duplication (PTD) was one of the top adverse predictors in the International Prognostic Scoring System-Molecular study. In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), ERG isoforms have been proposed as markers of favorable-risk DUX4 rearrangements, whereas deletion-mediated IKZF1 isoforms are associated with adverse prognosis and have been extended to the high-risk IKZF1",0
"A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic technique with isocratic elution has been developed to separate and quantitate the major phenolic compounds of the hydroalcoholic extracts of olive oils. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, caffeic acid,p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid were analyzed on a μBonapak C18 column with an acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (20:90:0.18, vol/vol/vol) mixture as a mobile phase. Electrochemical detection provided selectivity as well as sensitivity. The method was applied to the analysis of the most important phenolic compounds in olive oils.",1
"This study reports tannin contents of various tea (19), beer (6) and wine (6) samples, produced or sold in Turkey under different brand names. Determinations were carried out by employing a previously reported UV-vis spectrophotometric method. The standard addition procedure was also compared to the direct determination procedure and found to be more reliable. The tannin contents of hot water extracts of tea, tea bag and herbal tea samples ranged between 6.20-8.33, 8.03-6.59 and 2.76-6.54 percent (w/w) respectively. Tannin contents of beer and wine samples determined without extraction were found ranging between 66.36-77.26 and 67.18-107.62 micrograms/mL respectively. Iron contents of analysed wine samples were also found ranging between 0.36 and 10.33 ppm by AAS and no relation is found between tannin and iron contents.",1
"French wines are abundant sources of phenolic compounds. The content of several catechins, i.e., (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4, trimers C1, and trimer 2 (T2), of 160 French wines was determined by HPLC with UV detection. Red wines (n = 95) were found to have high levels of catechins, ranging from 32.8 to 209.8 mg/L (mean concentration 114.5 mg/L) for (+)-catechin, from 22.1 to 130.7 mg/L (mean concentration 75.7 mg/L) for (-)-epicatechin, from 7.8 to 39.1 mg/L (mean concentration 25.4 mg/L) for B1, from 18.3 to 93 mg/L (mean concentration 47.4 mg/L) for B2, from 21.4 to 215.6 mg/L (mean concentration 119.6 mg/L) for B3, from 20.2 to 107.2 mg/L (mean concentration 81.9 mg/l) for B4, from 8.6 to 36.9 mg/L (mean concentration 26.3 mg/L) for C1, and from 26.7 to 79.3 mg/L (mean concentration 67.1 mg/L) for T2. White and rosé wines (n = 57 and n = 8) were found to have low levels of (+)-catechin (mean concentrations 9.8 and 10.6 mg/L, respectively) and (-)-epicatechin (mean concentrations 5.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). These data provide a basis for the epidemiological evaluation of catechin intake by the consumption of French wine.",1
"The present study investigates the bioavailability of resveratrol and quercetin in humans, mice, and rats after oral ingestion of grape juice preparations or pure aglycones. Oral administration of resveratrol and quercetin to humans yielded detectable levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their derivatives in the plasma and urine. Urinary levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their metabolites were observed in human subjects receiving 600 and 1200 mL of grape juice, whereas quercetin metabolites were identified in urine samples even after receiving 200 mL of grape juice. The cumulative amounts of resveratrol and quercetin excreted in the urine of mice receiving concentrated grape juice for 4 days were 2.3 and 0.7% of the ingested doses, respectively. After i.g. administration of resveratrol to rats (2 mg/kg), up to 1.2 microM resveratrol was observed in the plasma. The study demonstrates that the glycoside forms of resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice are absorbed to a lesser extent than the aglycones.",1
"Advancements in paediatric oncology have made quality of life after cancer increasingly clinically important. Little is currently known about children's experiences of treatment completion and its management. The current study explores children's experience of ending treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), and the meaning it is given, particularly how endings are signified and marked. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven children who had completed cancer treatment for ALL with good prognoses. Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Five superordinate themes were generated: 'the end is always there', 'the punctuation of endings', 'that which is remembered, that which is forgotten', 'the voiced and the unvoiced', and 'freedom from cancer.' Children highlighted the importance of punctuating and celebrating the end of their treatment, and the need for doing this in ways that helped them process the complexity of ending active treatment and provides space for their voices.",0
"Rosemary plants were analysed using HPLC and eight different compounds (vanillic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, naringin, hispidulin, cirsimaritin, carnosol and carnosic acid) were identified and quantified. The analysis of the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity revealed that rosmarinic and carnosic acids were the best rosemary scavengers with IC sun(50) values of 27 and 32 micro M, respectively. Environmental influences on rosmarinic and carnosic acids content in rosemary plants were studied over a period of one year under southern UK conditions. Carnosic acid reached the maximum concentrations in December, decreasing by 50% during the summer months, while rosmarinic acid showed a constant concentration during the year. The significance of these results has been discussed later in this paper.",1
"Asparaginase is essential to chemotherapy regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Survival of patients with ALL has improved since incorporating asparaginase into chemotherapy backbones. Hispanic patients have a higher incidence of ALL than other ethnicities and suffer inferior outcomes. The inferior outcome of Hispanics is due to several factors, including the increased incidence of high-risk genetic subtypes and susceptibility to treatment-related toxicity. We summarize the current knowledge of asparaginase-related toxicity by comparing their incidence between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients. These toxicities include hypersensitivity, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, thrombosis, and hypertriglyceridemia. The PubMed database and Google Scholar were used to search for this review from October 2022 to June 2023. Except for hepatotoxicity and hypertriglyceridemia secondary to asparaginase-based treatments, which may develop more frequently among Hispanic patients with ALL, other toxicities were comparable between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients. Nevertheless, studies with larger cohorts and more accurate capturing of Hispanic ethnicity should be conducted to fill the gaps in the current knowledge.",0
"This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Olverembatinib in patients with relapsed and persistent minimal residual disease-positive Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics in 22 patients diagnosed with Ph + ALL at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital between December 2018 and December 2024. A cohort of 22 patients with Ph + ALL was enrolled in this study. Among them, 12 (54.5%) patients had relapsed Ph + ALL, while the remaining 10 patients exhibited persistent MRD positivity. In the relapsed subgroup, the CR rate following one treatment cycle reached 75.0% (9/12), with MRD-negative and MMR rates of 75.0% (9/12) and 50.0% (6/12), respectively. Upon completion of two treatment cycles in evaluable patients ( The efficacy and tolerability of Olverembatinib were confirmed in patients with relapsed, MRD-positive, Ph + ALL, offering a novel therapeutic approach for these patients and making prolonged survival possible.",0
"Unfortunately, cure of multi-drug resistant (MDR) hematologic malignancies remains an unmet need. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can sometimes eliminate multi-drug resistant leukemia but at a risk of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and procedure-related toxicity. Supported by pre-clinical experiments in animal models, we hypothesized that immunotherapy induced by non-engrafting intentionally mismatched IL-2 activated killers (IMAK) including both T & NK cells could induce safer, faster and much more effective immunotherapy while avoiding the need for SCT and the risks of GVHD. IMAK treatment was applied in 33 patients with MDR hematologic malignancies conditioned with cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m A total of 23/33 patients with MDR (4 failing SCT) achieved complete remission (CR). First patient currently 30 years with no further treatment and 6 observed for > 5 years (2 AML; 2 multiple myeloma, 1 ALL & 1 NHL) can be considered cured. No patient developed > grade 3 toxicity or GVHD. No residual male cells were detectable among six females treated with male cells beyond day + 6, confirming that GVHD was prevented by consistent early rejection of donor lymphocytes. We hypothesize that safe and superior immunotherapy of MDR with cure potential may be accomplished by IMAK, most probably in patients with low tumor burden, but that remains to be confirmed by future clinical trials.",0
"Vegetable consumption is associated with health benefits. Organic foods are thought to have higher contents of antioxidant substances. The objective of this work is to quantify soluble and hydrolyzable polyphenols, ascorbic acid, and the antioxidant capacity of fresh conventional and organic retail vegetables (potato, carrot, onion, broccoli, and white cabbage) while evaluating the effect of boiling, microwaving, and steaming on these parameters. The recovery rate for soluble and hydrolyzable polyphenols was variable according to the vegetable analyzed. However, soluble polyphenols resulted in lower recovery rates than did hydrolyzable phenolics after cooking. Organic vegetables showed higher sensitivity to heat processing than did conventionally grown vegetables. In general, cooking was found to lead to reductions in the antioxidant capacity for most vegetables, with small differences between the cooking methods applied. Even with the alterations in their content, polyphenols showed a positive correlation with antioxidant capacity in raw and cooked vegetables from both types of agriculture.",1
"A HPLC-MS procedure for the sensitive and specific analysis of the black tea flavonoid theaflavin in human plasma and urine was developed. Levels were measured after enzymatic deconjugation, extraction into ethyl acetate, and separation by HPLC, using tandem mass spectrometry as a detecting system. Two healthy volunteers consumed 700 mg theaflavins, equivalent to about 30 cups of black tea. The maximum concentration detected in blood plasma was 1.0 microg l(-1) in a sample collected after 2 h. The concentration in urine also peaked after 2 h at 4.2 microg l(-1). Hence, only minute amounts of theaflavins can be detected in plasma and urine samples of healthy volunteers after ingestion.",1
"Selected Greek regional, aged red wines were assessed for their polyphenolic composition using well-established spectrophotometric methodology, and tested for antioxidant potential by three different assays. The total polyphenol (TP) concentration was found to vary from 1217 to 3772 mg L−1 gallic acid equivalents, total anthocyanin (TA) content ranged from 44.3 to 360.1 mg L−1, and total flavanol (TF) from 291.1 to 664.8 mg L−1 catechin equivalents. The antiradical activity was evaluated using DPPH•, and varied from 0.73 to 1.37 m M Trolox® equivalents, while reducing power values were from 5.29 to 10.80 m M ascorbic acid equivalents, using a modified FRAP assay. The hydroxyl free radical scavenging activity was determined with the deoxyribose method, and ranged from 38.5 to 59.9% decrease in A532 relative to control. The examinations showed that TP and TF may provide a significant contribution to the overall antioxidant status of wines, but TA appears to be a less important factor in this respect. Reducing power was found to be highly associated with the antiradical activity of wines.",1
"Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenolics were studied in two pear cultivars, d'Anjou and Bartlett. PPO activity, total phenolics and chlorogenic acid concentration differed significantly with respect to cultivar. PPO activity, total phenolics and chlorogenic acid all decreased in overripe fruits. the pH optimum (d'Anjou, 4.7 and Bartlett, 5.5), and optimum temperature (d'Anjou 40C and Bartlett, 20C) for maximum PPO activity were determined. Among substrates, 4-methylcatechol followed by catechol and dopamine, was the most readily oxidized substrate of PPO from both pear cultivars. the enzyme from both cultivars did not show any activity with any of the monohydroxy substrates. Km of 13.33 and 10.92 mM were determined with 4-methylcatechol for d'Anjou and Bartlett pear PPO, respectively. Benzoic and cinnamic acid series compounds were poor inhibitors of PPO. However, L-cysteine, sodium metabisulfite, ascorbic acid and thiourea proved to be effective inhibitors of this enzyme. Heating at 65C for 30 min resulted in a loss of 60–72% of PPO activity",1
"Phenolic compounds are major constituents of red wines and impact on certain wine-quality parameters. This study has aimed to increase the knowledge base on the phenolic composition of South African red wines by HPLC quantification of 39 individual phenols and 2 polymeric, phenolic groups in 260 South African wines of the cultivars Pinotage, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Statistical analysis of the collected data revealed significant cultivar differences in the levels of many of the analysed compounds, as well as in the ratios in which specific anthocyanins are found in the wines. These data may be helpful in the cultivar authentication of wines of these cultivars. Discriminant analysis of the data showed statistically significant separations of cultivars, based on their polyphenol composition, and also how the use of data from a specific wine-producing area or vintage improved the possibilities for successful authentication. The data were collected from both pure cultivar wines and commercial wines, which may contain up to 15 % of another cultivar wine. The collected data may therefore be further segmented into those obtained from pure cultivar wines and those obtained from blended wines in order to further enhance the accuracy of authentication of these respective groups of wines. The information obtained from this study opens several avenues for research on the impact of the noted cultivar differences on wine quality. Cultivar differences in the phenolic composition of young red wines also have important implications for the oenological management of oxidation reactions taking place during vinification and aging.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, comprising approximately 25% of pediatric malignancies. Notably, chromosomal aberrations and genetic alterations play a central role in the pathogenesis of ALL, serving as critical diagnostic and prognostic markers. In this study, we use array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) to explore the landscape of copy number variations (CNVs) and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in 67 Malaysian childhood ALL patients with normal karyotype. A total of 36 pathogenic CNVs (26 gains, 10 losses) were identified in 19 (28.4%) patients which harbor genes related to the development of ALL. The genes include the MLLT3 (9p21.3), ETV6 (12p13.2), RUNX1 (21q22.12), ERG (21q22.2) and DMD (Xp21.1). On the other hand, a total of 46 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) was observed in 34 (50.7%) patients. Our study indicates that array-CGH is able to identify and characterize the CNVs responsible for the pathogenesis of childhood ALL. However, further studies are required to determine the pathogenic implications of VUS in the development of childhood ALL.",0
"The anthocyanin contents of Balaton and Montmorency cherries were compared. The results indicate that both cherries contain identical anthocyanins. However, Balaton contains approximately six times more anthocyanins than does Montmorency. Also, hydrolysis of the total anthocyanins and subsequent gas chromatographic (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments with the resulting products indicated that both varieties contain only one aglycon cyanidin. This observation contrasts with existing reports of the presence of peonidin glycosides in Montmorency cherry. Results of the present study suggest that the anthocyanins in Balaton and Montmorency cherries are anthocyanin 1 [3-cyanidin 2‘‘-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-6‘‘-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside], anthocyanin 2 [3-cyanidin 6‘‘-O-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-β-d-glucopyranoside], and anthocyanin 3 [3-cyanidin O-β-d-glucopyranoside].",1
"Pepper (Capsicum annum L.) has long been recognized as an excellent source of antioxidants, being rich in ascorbic acid and other phytochemicals. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of different cooking methods on the antioxidant properties of coloured peppers. Six varieties of peppers were subjected to different cooking methods, such as microwave heating, stir-frying and boiling in water, for 5min individually. The cooked and raw peppers were analyzed for radical-scavenging activity (RSA) and total polyphenol content (TP) using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl–high-pressure liquid chromatography (DPPH)–HPLC and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively. The samples were also evaluated for ascorbic acid content (AsA) by HPLC. Total carotenoid content was determined spectrophotometrically. Results suggest that there is no significant (P>0.05) difference in RSA, TP, AsA and total carotenoid contents between the cooked and raw peppers when processed for 5min. However, the cooked peppers show marked differences (P<0.05) in the RSA, TP and AsA when cooked for 5min in boiling water with further reduction observed after boiling for 30min. This may be due to the leaching of antioxidant compounds from the pepper into the cooking water during the prolonged exposure to water and heat. Therefore, it is vital to use less water and cooking time and also to consume the water used for boiling so as to obtain the optimum benefits of bioactive compounds present in peppers. It is concluded that microwave heating and stir-frying without using water are more suitable cooking methods for pepper, to ensure the maximum retention of antioxidant molecules.",1
"This case report presents a 53-year-old female patient with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) following an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, leading to significant respiratory distress and notable skin findings, including hyperpigmentation and chronic non-healing ulcers. The patient's clinical course illustrates the diverse manifestations of cGVHD, emphasizing the importance of recognizing that not all febrile episodes in post-transplant patients are attributable solely to infection. A multidisciplinary approach was essential for accurate diagnosis and management, underscoring the need for comprehensive evaluation of symptoms in immunocompromised patients. This case contributes to the understanding of cGVHD's clinical implications and highlights the necessity for ongoing research in its management.",0
"Allo-HSCT is a well-established treatment for several hematological malignancies. Relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains a significant problem and is associated with a poor prognosis and low overall survival. Chimerism analysis is one of the tools applied in post-transplant monitoring, as an increasing fraction of recipient cells after HSCT has been linked to a higher risk of relapse. In this retrospective, single-centre study we have analysed the data of patients treated with allo-HSCT for a range of hematological malignancies in the Department of Paediatric Haematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland, between years 2002-2018. For all 103 patients 3-years OS was 72.6 (95% CI: 64.3-82.0) and 3-years EFS was 72.0 (95% CI: 63.5-81.6). There were no differences in 3-years OS and EFS in group of patients who achieved FDC <14 and >14 days: 67.9 (95% CI: 57.4-80.3) vs 81.9 (95% CI: 69.7-96.2), p = 0.220 and 66.0 (95% CI: 55.3-78.7) vs 84.1 (95% CI: 72.3-97.9), p = 0.073, respectively. Early FDC achievement was not significantly associated with risk of relapse, p = 0.181. Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis AML/MDS increased risk of relapse 3x compared to ALL, HR = 2.72, CI95 [1.24-5.98], p = 0.013; PB/CB increased the risk nearly 3x compared to cells from BM, HR = 2.52, CI95 [1.12-5.65], p = 0.025. In presented study, achieving early FDC was not associated with lower risk of relapse and had no impact on overall and event-free survival. However, the study presents a unique data of very early chimerism in a large cohort of paediatric patients with haematological malignancies treated within a single unit. Possible extensions to this study, to include analysing more data from a larger patient cohort, may allow us to determine the exact prognostic value of very early chimerism analysis to establish relevant cutoff values and risk thresholds for intervention.",0
"A national sampling plan was developed to select the most widely used isoflavone-containing foods in the United States. Foods were selected based on their retail volume and sampled in five geographical areas representing seven metropolitan areas. Isoflavones were analyzed from composite samples, raw and cooked, and reported by brand. Quality control measures were evaluated throughout the study. Isoflavone levels ranged from 1 microg/g in soy sauces to 540 microg/g in tempeh. Soymilk and tofu represented the major portion of soy foods evaluated. These data will appear in the electronic version of USDA Handbook No. 8 of Food Composition Data in 1999.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematologic malignancy that primarily affects children. The diagnosis and treatment of pediatric ALL remain challenging. This study aimed to identify differential lipids and metabolites that may hold potential for improving ALL treatment. In this retrospective case-control study, serum samples obtained from children with ALL and healthy controls were analyzed. Serum lipidome and metabolome alterations of ALL were analyzed by comparing pediatric patients with ALL with healthy controls based on liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis of serum lipidomic and metabolomic signatures. We identified 2,298 lipid features in the serum. Among them, 72 (3.13%) differed significantly in pediatric patients with ALL compared to healthy controls. Notably, sphingolipids (ceramide and sphingomyelin) and phospholipids exhibited the most pronounced changes. Targeted analysis of ceramides revealed significantly elevated levels of Cer 18:0 and Cer 20:0 in the serum of pediatric patients with ALL. Additionally, gut microbial-related lipids (such as sulfonolipids and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids) showed significant alterations. Metabolomic analysis identified 15 differential metabolites, indicating disrupted nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, the dysregulated lipids and metabolites correlated with various blood indicators, with ceramide and nucleosides positively associated with white blood cell count but negatively correlated with hemoglobin and platelet. These findings shed light on abnormal molecular signatures contributing to pediatric ALL and may serve as potential biomarker panel for therapy of ALL.",0
"Quercetin and quercetin glycosides from food or dietary supplements appear in body tissues almost exclusively as glucuronated, sulfated, and methylated quercetin conjugates, suggesting that the in vivo bioactivity of quercetin may be due to its metabolites. In this study, pre- and postabsorptive metabolism of orally ingested quercetin was examined by comparing the metabolite pattern in gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, contents, and internal tissues. F344 rats (n = 6) were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 0.45% quercetin and the metabolite patterns were determined in the tissues and contents of stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon and in liver, kidney, and plasma using LC-MS/MS. GI contents contained predominantly unmetabolized quercetin at 94-100%, whereas quercetin in GI tissues was present as 11 different sulfated, glucuronated, and methylated metabolites at 32% in stomach, 88% in small intestine, 27% in cecum, and 46% in colon. Quercetin was further metabolized postabsorption and found in liver, kidney, and plasma almost exclusively as sulfated methyl-quercetin glucuronide. The unique pattern of quercetin metabolites in each GI tissue indicates extensive biotransformation before absorption and distribution in rats.",1
"Aleukemic leukemia cutis (ALC) is a rare condition and concerns less than 10% of leukemia cutis (LC) cases. LC is defined as a cutaneous infiltration of neoplastic myeloid or lymphoid blasts, which occurs in the absence of any prior bone marrow or peripheral blood involvement. A pediatric case of B-cell ALL presenting as ALC is presented because of an exceptional testicular localization. B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presenting as ALC is rarely described in the literature, and this case could be the first of childhood ALC with testicular involvement.",0
"Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for all of the berry types.",1
"Epidemiologic studies have linked flavonoid-rich foods with a reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality. Some cocoas are flavonoid-rich and contain the monomeric flavanols (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin and oligomeric procyanidins formed from these monomeric units. Both the monomers and the oligomers have shown potential in favorably influencing cardiovascular health in in vitro and preliminary clinical studies. Although previous investigations have shown increasing concentrations of (-)-epicatechin in human plasma after cocoa consumption, no information is available in the published literature regarding the presence of procyanidins in human plasma.",1
"This study sought to evaluate the effect of steam cooking on the vitamin C, total phenolics, total flavonoid and antioxidant properties (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH] free radical and 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonate) [ABTS*] radical scavenging abilities, reducing property and Fe2+ chelating ability) of some tropical green leafy vegetables: Talinum triangulare, Ocimum gratissimum, Amaranthus hybridus, Telfairia occidentalis, Ipomea batata, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Baselia alba and Senecio biafrae leaves. The results of the study revealed that cooking causes a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the vitamin C (raw [321.4–842.0], cooked [198.2–638.4 mg/100 g]) content. Conversely, there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the total phenol (raw [146.9–693.8], cooked [272.9–1037.5 mg/100 g]), total flavonoid (raw [8.2–53.0], cooked [12.9–57.4 mg/100 g]), DPPH radical scavenging ability (raw [15.7–61.8], cooked [52.8–92.7%]), reducing property (raw: 28.3–61.8; cooked: 43.9–71.6 mg/100 g ascorbic acid equivalent [AAE]), Fe2+ chelating ability (raw [17.4–75.4], cooked [22.8–89.2%]) and ABTS* scavenging ability (raw [17.4–87.3], cooked [57.5–113.2 mmol/100 g trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]). In view of this, it could be concluded that steam cooking decreases the vitamin C content of all the vegetables, while it increased the phenolic content and antioxidant activities.",1
"Potatoes in the diet contribute significantly to antioxidant daily intake worldwide. The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert influence on the antioxidant capacity. The results imply that the potato varieties rich in antioxidant components could be good antioxidant sources as activities are not greatly affected by different cooking conditions.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive leukemia subtype and a prevalent malignancy in children, with poor prognosis, high relapse rates, and drug resistance. Recent research has shown that super-enhancer-regulated genes play crucial roles in T-ALL progression. In this study, we identified SH2 domain containing 1 A (SH2D1A) as a gene regulated by super-enhancers, and is overexpressed, which correlates with unfavorable clinical outcomes in T-ALL. To investigate its role, we silenced SH2D1A expression in T-ALL cell models using RNA interference. This led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation, colony formation, and promoted apoptosis, as demonstrated by CCK-8 assays, soft agar colony formation, and flow cytometry analysis. In vivo, knockdown of SH2D1A significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice bearing T-ALL. Mechanistically, we found that SH2D1A contributes to T-ALL progression by upregulating CHI3L2, a downstream effector that promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. Using ChIP-Seq and RNA-seq technologies, we confirmed that SH2D1A regulates CHI3L2 expression through super-enhancer-mediated regulation in T-ALL cells. Our findings suggest that SH2D1A and CHI3L2 act as oncogenes in T-ALL, and may represent novel therapeutic targets. This research offers new insights into the molecular mechanisms of T-ALL and highlights potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",0

Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and procyanidins and has been shown in various models to inhibit LDL oxidation and atherogenesis.,1
"The neutral phenolic compounds, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, flavan-3-ols polymers (procyanidins), phloridzin, phloretin xyloglucoside, and the flavonol glycosides (isoquercitrin, hyperin, quercitrin, avicularin, and rutin), in apple juice were extracted with ethyl acetate and separated and quantified by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column using an acidified water (pH 2.8)-methanol solvent gradient. A diode array detector was used to evaluate the separation and to identify the phenolic compounds. The recovery obtained for the flavanols and some dihydrochalcones ranged between 93% and 106%. On the contrary, the 30% recovery rate obtained for flavonols shows that ethyl acetate liquid-liquid extraction, usually employed in this type of study, is not recommended for the extraction of these last compounds.",1

"Glucocorticoids are a mainstay in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor (TF), mediates their actions. Chromatin occupancy, chromatin-protein networks (chromatomes) and gene programmes of GR are regulated by SUMOylation, a post-translational modification with therapeutic implications in other hematomalignancies. To unravel the GR-SUMOylation crosstalk in B-ALL, we induced hypoSUMOylation in NALM6 B-ALL cells with a SUMOylation inhibitor (SUMOi, ML-792). Genome-wide profiling of GR and SUMO chromatin-binding and chromatin accessibility revealed that hypoSUMOylation augmented GR chromatin occupancy and altered chromatin openness. Association with transcriptome data indicated that the hypoSUMOylation-induced GR-binding sites predominantly repressed genes associated with cell cycle and DNA replication. Consistently, hypoSUMOylation potentiated glucocorticoid-induced cell cycle arrest and growth suppression. Moreover, our proteomic analyses revealed that the protein network of chromatin-bound GR is tightly intertwined with SUMO2/3 and that SUMOylation modulates the stability of the network. The chromatome contained several B-cell TFs with cognate binding motifs found on GR-adjacent chromatin sites, indicating their simultaneous occupancy on chromatin. In sum, our data imply potential for targeting SUMOylation to increase sensitivity to glucocorticoids in B-ALL, supported by ex vivo data of glucocorticoid and SUMOi TAK-981 combination-treated B-ALL patient samples.",0
"As the most common pediatric malignancy, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has multiple distinct subtypes characterized by recurrent and sporadic somatic and germline genetic alterations. Identifying B-ALL subtypes can facilitate risk stratification and enable tailored therapeutic design. Existing methods for B-ALL subtyping primarily depend on immunophenotyping, cytogenetic tests and genomic profiling, which would be costly, complicated, and laborious. To overcome these challenges, we present",0
"The position of conjugation of the flavonoid quercetin dramatically affects biological activity in vitro, therefore it is important to determine the exact nature of the plasma metabolites. In the present study, we have used various methods (HPLC with diode array detection, LCMS, chemical and enzymic synthesis of authentic conjugates and specific enzymic hydrolysis) to show that quercetin glucosides are not present in plasma of human subjects 1.5 h after consumption of onions (a rich source of flavonoid glucosides). All four individuals had similar qualitative profiles of metabolites. The major circulating compounds in the plasma after 1.5 h are identified as quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin-3'-sulfate. The existence of substitutions in the B and/or C ring of plasma quercetin metabolites suggests that these conjugates will each have very different biological activities.",1
"Intrathecal methotrexate can cause cauda equina syndrome in pediatric ALL patients, as demonstrated in this rare case of an 8-year-old boy. Symptoms included progressive limb weakness and urinary retention. Early recognition, prompt discontinuation of the offending agent, and multidisciplinary management are crucial. Vigilant neurological monitoring is essential for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients receiving intrathecal chemotherapy.",0
"This study was undertaken to evaluate, in humans, the antioxidant activity of olive oil phenolics, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone that share an orthodiphenolic (catecholic) structure. Human volunteers were administered olive oil samples containing increasing amounts of an olive oil phenolic extract that was characterized by gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry. The administration of phenol-rich oils was dose-dependently associated with a decreased urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), a biomarker of oxidative stress. Also, a statistically significant negative correlation between homovanillyl alcohol (HValc, hydroxytyrosol's major metabolite, formed through the COMT system) and F(2)-isoprostanes excretion was found. Thus, the administration of oil samples with increasing, albeit low, concentrations of orthodiphenolic compounds, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone, results in a dose-dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha). The statistically significant negative correlation between 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and HValc urinary concentrations suggests that this metabolite better reflects the in vivo activities of hydroxytyrosol.",1
"Minimal residual disease (MRD)-guided therapy is the global standard treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We assessed the impact of MRD-driven intensification along with protocol-defined risk groups in pediatric ALL treatment. This retrospective analysis included 209 patients with ALL (treated between January 2013 to June 2023). MRD was assessed using six- to eight-color flow cytometry at the end of each phase before the maintenance phase. Post-induction treatment was determined based on early response, National Cancer Institute risk, and cytogenetics. High-risk (HR) patients followed the Korean HR or CCG-1882 protocols and standard-risk (SR) patients followed the modified COG-AALL0331 protocol. Treatment was intensified if flow-MRD ≥ 0.1% was identified. Overall, 103 and 106 patients were classified as having SR and HR, respectively. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 92.5% and 84.3%, respectively. Thirty SR and 18 HR patients received intensified chemotherapy. Treatment intensification significantly improved EFS in patients with high MRD (94.2% vs. 75.5%, p = 0.04), particularly in post-induction patients with high MRD (90.0% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.035). The difference in survival between rapid early responder (RER) and slow early responder (SER) groups was eliminated after MRD-based intensification. The implementation rates of treatment intensification varied over time (9.1% before 2015, 28.6% during 2016-2019, and 13.9% during 2020-2023), reflecting improved risk stratification and therapy selection. MRD-guided therapy intensification markedly improved survival outcomes in patients with pediatric ALL when combined with risk-based protocols, highlighting the importance of MRD monitoring for optimizing risk-adapted treatment strategies.",0
"A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography procedure is proposed for the determination of 10 phenolic compounds (eriodictyol 7-O-rutinoside, eriodictyol 7-O-glucoside, luteolin 7-O-rutinoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, hesperetin 7-O-rutinoside, apigenin 7-O-rutinoside, rosmarinic acid, 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,4′-tetramethoxyflavone, pebrellin and gardenin B) in peppermint. The chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed-phase Spherisorb ODS 2 (5 μm particle size; 25.0×0.46 cm) column. Of the several extractive solvents tried, ethanol was the best for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Best resolution was obtained using a gradient of water-phosphoric acid (999:1) and acetonitrile. Fourteen samples were subjected to quantification and showed a common composition pattern.",1
"Literature is highly inconsistent in describing the proximal attachment of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) and its relationship with the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) in human knees. This observational study aims to investigate that lacuna. The gross dissection was performed in the lower limbs (n = 83) from the donated adult-age (> 18 years) embalmed cadavers from medical institutions in the north and east India. The dissected knee specimens were first examined macroscopically. Further routine and special staining and microscopic examinations were performed. The ALL was absent in approximately 20.4% of the studied knee specimens (17/83). In remaining, the sharing of ALL and LCL proximal fibers was observed as a consistent finding (~ 97%) with rare exceptions. The mean length of the tibial and meniscal limbs of ALL was 1.57 ± 0.8 cm [Range (R) 0.5-4 cm] and 0.73 ± 0.47 cm [Range (R) 0.1-1.6 cm], respectively. In addition, multiple variations in its presentation were observed. We propose that the proximal sharing of LCL-ALL fibers is a dominant feature in the studied population. The sharing of the fibers may impact the biomechanics and injury mechanisms for both ligaments. The possibility of ethnic variations in the ALL morphology should be a concern during reconstruction surgery.",0

"Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots (1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves (30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg). Apigenin was found only in Chinese cabbage (187.0 mg/kg), bell pepper (272.0 mg/kg), garlic (217.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (458.0 mg/kg), French peas (176.0 mg/kg), snake gourd (42.4 mg/kg), guava (579.0 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves (547.0 mg/kg), local celery (338.5 mg/kg), daun turi (39.5 mg/kg), and kadok (34.5 mg/kg). In vegetables, quercetin glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are also present. Fruits contain almost exclusively quercetin glycosides, whereas kaempferol and myricetin glycosides are found only in trace quantities.",1
"Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in food to Eastern diets.",1
"To investigate the clinical application value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based bone marrow cell recognition and analysis system in the diagnosis of hematological diseases. The bone marrow smears of hematological patients who were admitted to The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from 2018 to 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 115 bone marrow smears with clear diagnosis and typical cell morphology characteristics were selected, including 20 cases of immune thrombocytopenia(ITP), 11 cases of iron deficiency anemia (IDA), 17 cases of megaloblastic anemia (MA), 20 cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 17 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 23 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and 7 cases of acute myeloid leukemia unclassified (AML-M2). The samples were analyzed by manual microscopic examination, AI automatic recognition, and manual correction after AI recognition. The images captured by the AI device were clear, and the cell morphological structures were distinct. The average experimental diagnostic efficiency parameters of the bone marrow nucleated cells classified in this system were calculated. The sensitivity was 74.90%, specificity was 99.03%, and accuracy was 98.29%. In the comparison between the AI recognition group and the manual examination group, the data of IDA, ITP, MA, and CML diseases were all greater than 0.85 in ICC correlation coefficient, with excellent consistency; the data of APL, AML-M2, and ALL three diseases were between 0.6 and 0.85 in ICC correlation coefficient, with moderate consistency. However, after manual review and correction, the ICC correlation coefficient between the data of the AI correction group and the data from the manual examination group was greatly improved. The AI bone marrow cell recognition and analysis system has the characteristics of high accuracy, high specificity, good sensitivity and fast detection. When used in combination with manual review, it can improve the detection efficiency of bone marrow cells morphological analysis and meet the needs of clinical work. 人工智能骨髓细胞识别分析系统在血液病辅助诊断中的应用. 探讨基于人工智能（Artificial Intelligence，AI）的骨髓细胞识别分析系统在临床血液系统疾病诊断工作中的应用价值。. 回顾性分析2018年至2020年于山西医科大学第二医院就诊的血液病患者的骨髓涂片,选取已明确诊断且细胞形态特征较为典型的骨髓涂片样本115例，其中免疫性血小板减少性紫癜（ITP)20例，缺铁性贫血(IDA)11例，巨幼细胞贫血(MA)17例，慢性髓系白血病（CML）20例，急性淋巴细胞白血病(ALL)17例，急性早幼粒细胞白血病(APL)23例，急性髓系白血病未分化型（AML-M2）7例，通过人工镜检、AI自动识别、AI识别后人工校正三种方法对样本进行细胞计数和形态学分析。.

"Growing evidence of the role of free radicals and antioxidants in health and ageing has focussed great interest on these compounds. The relationship between the total antioxidant potential and the phenolic content of commercial wines was evaluated. A close relationship between total phenolic content and total antioxidant potential for all wines was observed. Capillary zone electrophoresis showed that, in red wines, gallic acid was the highest of the phenolic acids and (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin were the next most abundant phenolics. Also, these compounds were strictly correlated with the total antioxidant potential of wines. Total antioxidant potential, by bleaching of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical cations, using gallic acid as standard, could be a practical and simple measurement to evaluate the characteristics of different wines. Furthermore, capillary electrophoresis is a powerful and high-performing tool for evaluating principal antioxidant wine components.",1
"Vitamin C and polyphenol content as well as total antioxidative activity were investigated in fresh leaves of kale; in leaves after blanching or cooking; and in frozen and canned leaves. In 100g fresh matter, kale leaves contained 384.9mg polyphenols and 112.1mg vitamin C, with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) level of 1175μM Trolox. Of the polyphenols identified in kale leaves, ferulic acid occurred in the highest amount (240.44mg/100g, constituting 62% of total polyphenols). Freezing was a better method of preserving kale leaves since the loss of nutritive constituents was lower than in the case of canning. Depending on preliminary processing and storage temperature, after one-year storage frozen leaves contained 82.9–171.3mg polyphenols and 39.3–65.4mg vitamin C, with TEAC at the level of 501–681μM Trolox in 100g. In canned leaves these values were: 91.3–94.1mg polyphenols, 16.1–19.3mg vitamin C and 268–293μM Trolox.",1

"Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving sizes.",1
"Vitamin D insufficiency is a global health problem affecting healthy and diseased individuals, including patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). Identifying dietary factors that may affect vitamin D levels and providing dietary guidelines accordingly can alleviate this problem. We therefore aimed to identify still unknown associations of dietary patterns, assessed through the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) with vitamin D blood levels. FFQ was collected from 459 patients from Croatian Biobank of Patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (CROHT), while total 25(OH)D was measured from their stored serum samples. We performed linear regression analysis between vitamin D levels and weekly intake of 24 food groups in 459 patients with HT (ALL), and in two disease-severity groups (MILD and OVERT). The main results of our study are observations of: (1) an inverse association between vitamin D levels and coffee consumption (ALL: Further research into the functional and causal relationships of the observed associations is important to provide guidance regarding coffee/sugar intake on vitamin D status. A well-balanced diet can help prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve the quality of life of patients with HT, especially those in later stages of disease characterized by greater metabolic imbalance.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a blood malignancy characterized by a rapid proliferation of lymphoid progenitor cells. Extramedullary relapse (EMR) is the recurrence of leukemia that occurs outside the bone marrow. The central nervous system is the most prevalent site of EMR in ALL, whereas other organs, particularly the renal organs, are less commonly involved. A 49-year-old man diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL (Ph-negative ALL) received a second umbilical cord blood transplant (uCBT) and was confirmed to be in his third hematological complete remission. However, the perirenal mass lesion emerged after two weeks, and was difficult to detect on echography in the prone position. We successfully performed a percutaneous biopsy of the mass in a sitting position and pathologically identified it as EMR. After the diagnosis, chemotherapy was restarted, and the patient was scheduled to receive a third uCBT. This is the first report of EMR in a perirenal lesion of ALL and shows that this novel biopsy can be performed as a renal biopsy, even in a sitting position. This case is the first to describe a biopsy technique in detail and demonstrates the value of collaboration between hematologists and nephrologists in diagnosing EMR of the kidneys.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare disease in adults, but is the most common pediatric malignancy and the leading cause of death among children with cancer worldwide. While initial treatment regimens induce remission in most patients, relapses still occur in many cases during or after treatment. Relapses are difficult to treat and continue to be one of the leading causes of ALL-related deaths. Thus, it is essential to understand the biological mechanisms underlying ALL relapses, and to identify reliable biomarkers for better relapse risk prediction and novel druggable targets for precision treatments tailored to risk profiles. Here we review the latest developments in ALL research with a focus on relapse mechanisms, and we discuss related hopes and challenges.",0
"Based on the results of the phase III randomized 20120215 trial, the European Medicines Agency granted the approval of blinatumomab for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk first-relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In France, blinatumomab received reimbursement for this indication in May 2022. This analysis assessed the cost effectiveness of blinatumomab compared with high-risk consolidation chemotherapy (HC3) in this indication from a French healthcare and societal perspective. A partitioned survival model with three health states (event-free, post-event and death) was developed to estimate life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs over a lifetime horizon. Patients who were alive after 5 years were considered to be cured. An excess mortality rate was applied to capture the late effects of cancer therapy. Utility values were based on the TOWER trial using French tariffs, and cost input data were identified from French national public health sources. The model was validated by clinical experts. Treatment with blinatumomab over HC3 was estimated to provide gains of 8.39 LYs and 7.16 QALYs. Total healthcare costs for blinatumomab and HC3 were estimated to be €154,326 and €102,028, respectively, resulting in an increment of €52,298. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be €7308 per QALY gained from a healthcare perspective. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including analysis from the societal perspective. Blinatumomab administered as part of consolidation therapy in pediatric patients with high-risk first-relapsed ALL is cost effective compared with HC3 from the French healthcare and societal perspective.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disease characterized by the clonal proliferation of precursor lymphoblasts in the bone marrow. Granular acute lymphoblastic leukemia (G-ALL) is a rare subtype of ALL, primarily associated with B-cell lineage. Traditionally, cytoplasmic granules indicate myeloid leukemia cell differentiation, as primitive lymphoblasts typically lack cytoplasmic granules. Therefore, the immature lymphoblasts in G-ALL may be mistaken for granular myeloid progenitor cells, causing potential diagnostic errors. The involvement of the BCOR gene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been well-documented. This study examines the clinical data of a G-ALL patient, reviews relevant literature, and aims to improve disease recognition among clinicians and laboratory personnel, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and reduce instances of misdiagnosis and mistreatment.",0
"Dietary flavonoids can be converted into phenolic acids by colonic microflora. Phenolic acids can then be absorbed into the circulation and may contribute to the health-promoting effects of the parent compounds. Phenolic acids can be further metabolized in other tissues via methylation and conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. The objectives of this study were to identify and quantify the urinary excretion of 19 phenolic acids and their conjugates in rats fed three levels of a concentrated cranberry powder (3.3, 6.6, and 33 mg/kg of diet). The basic diet used was AIN93G diet containing very low amounts of any polyphenolic compounds. Of the phenolic acids studied, the amounts excreted varied by 4 orders of magnitude, with hippuric acid being excreted in the highest quantities. Amounts of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (3HPPA), and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4HCA) excreted were in the range of 18-33 microg/mg creatinine in animals fed the highest level of cranberry powder, whereas phenylacetic acid (PAA), gallic acid (GA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (34HPAA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (34HBA), 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (34HCA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (FA) were excreted in the urine in concentrations of 0.1-2 microg/mg creatinine. As the amount of cranberry in the diet was increased, the amount of 4HPAA excreted decreased but the percentage of conjugated 4HPAA excreted increased (from 57 to 91%). For other phenolic acids analyzed, the percentage excreted in the conjugated form was approximately constant across levels of cranberry in the diet and ranged from 65 to 100% for the individual phenolic acids. Studies of bioactivity and health effects need to consider more than just the compound(s) in the food, because they can be metabolized to other lower molecular weight compounds, which in turn may also be methylated or conjugated in some form that may affect the perceived health effects.",1
"Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed < 0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 +/- 0.03 micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the vitamin C content significantly dropped to 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.01, and 0.54 +/- 0.02 micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the trans-lycopene content had increased to 3.11+/- 0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 +/- 0.36 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 degrees C for 2, 15, and 30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 +/- 0.26, 5.53 +/- 0.24, and 6.70 +/- 0.25 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of chronic diseases.",1
"The antioxidation capacities of green ‘Welcome’, green and white ‘Gijnlim’, and purple ‘Purple passion’ asparagus spears were evaluated. Analyses of rutin and total polyphenols, and assays of DPPH radical absorbing and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) antioxidation were conducted. Varietal differences associated with the colors of spears were observed both in the amounts of rutin, total polyphenols and in DPPH radical absorbing activities, although not in LDL antioxidation activities. DPPH radical absorbing activities seemed to be affected by both rutin and other polyphenolic compounds. However, LDL antioxidation activities were likely to be influenced more by other polyphenolic compounds than by rutin. Total polyphenol content showed a fairly close relationship with rutin content, DPPH radical absorbing activity and LDL antioxidation activity. To determinate total polyphenol content using the Folin–Denis’ method seemed to be useful for selecting the breeding lines that show high antioxidative capacities.",1
"Several clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that moderate wine consumption may exert a protective effect against oxidative stress involved in several diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the epidemiological assessment of wine consumption has usually been obtained using self-reported questionnaires containing less reliable information for assessing total intake than nutritional biomarkers. A reliable biomarker for wine consumption is, therefore, needed. To validate urinary resveratrol metabolites (RMs) as a biomarker of wine consumption in a large cohort of free-living subjects, 1000 consecutive subjects entering a substudy of the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) were evaluated. Data were collected in a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. RMs were measured in morning urine by LC-MS/MS. Urinary RM values correlated directly with reported daily amounts of wine consumed (r=0.895; p<0.001). One drink of wine per week can be detected. Using a cut-off of 411.4 nmol/g creatinine, the measurement of urinary RMs could discriminate wine consumers from non-wine consumers with a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91.5-94.7%) and a specificity of 92.1% (CI 90.2-93.7%). Urinary RMs fulfill the criteria to be considered as a nutritional biomarker of wine consumption in a large sample of free-living subjects. This biomarker would provide an additional tool for investigating more precisely the relationship between wine consumption and health benefits.",1
"Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate (glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.",1
"Prenatal exposure to air pollution may be a risk factor for childhood cancer, but epidemiological evidence is scarce.

"The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.",1
"Eight different barley cultivars were roasted in sand and cooked in a microwave oven and evaluated for antioxidant activity (AOA), total phenolic content (TPC), non-enzymatic browning, polyphenol oxidase activity (PPO), total flavonoid content (TFC), reducing power and metal chelating activity. Sand roasting resulted in higher puffing index. Greater increase in yellowness of the roasted flour was brought about by microwave cooking. A significant decrease in TPC (8.5 to 49.6%) and TFC (24.5 to 53.2%) was observed after roasting. The AOA significantly increased (16.8 to 108.2%) after roasting with sand roasted barley exhibiting higher AOA. The reducing power and metal chelating activity significantly increased by up to 77.5% and 78.9%, respectively after roasting with sand roasted samples showing greater effect. The non-enzymatic browning index increased (315 to 774%) and was higher for sand roasted barley. The microwave cooking brought about a greater reduction (45.1 to 76.8%) in PPO activity.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies are highly efficacious for several different hematologic cancers. However, for most CAR T targets it is observed that low surface antigen density on tumors can significantly reduce therapeutic efficacy. Here, we explore this dynamic in the context of CD72, a surface antigen we recently found as a promising target for refractory B-cell cancers, but for which CD72 low antigen density can lead to therapeutic resistance in preclinical models. Primary samples were accessed via institutional review board-approved protocols. Affinity-matured and humanized nanobody clones were previously described in Temple et al. We first confirmed ubiquitous CD72 expression across a range of primary B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We further found that after resistance to CD19-directed therapies, across both B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) models and primary tumor samples, surface CD72 expression was largely preserved while CD22 expression was significantly diminished. Affinity maturation of a nanobody targeting CD72, when incorporated into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, led to more effective elimination Together, these findings support affinity-matured CD72 nanoCARs as a potential immunotherapy product for CD19-refractory B-cell cancers. Our results also suggest that for B-ALL in particular, CD72 may be a preferable second-line immunotherapy target over CD22.",0
"High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood (Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H(3)P0(4) in water and 0.1% H(3)PO(4) in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-microm ODS Prep column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida were cyanidin-3-(6""-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside (33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE L,a,b) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges.",1
"Relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) remains a therapeutic challenge. Preclinical data in both B- and T-ALL suggests synergy of venetoclax (VEN) with vincristine (VCR). We designed a phase I/II trial (EA9152) of the combination of L-VCR and VEN for patients with r/r B-or T-cell ALL or LL. Here, we report the safety and efficacy outcomes of the phase I portion of this trial (NCT03504644). In a 3+3 dose escalation design, r/r ALL subjects were given single-agent VEN doses reaching 400, 600, or 800 mg for the three respective dose levels. Weekly L-VCR at 2.25 mg/m Among the 18 patients in phase I, grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 89% of treated patients. Two patients (two of three) at dose level 3 experienced dose-limiting toxicities. Therefore, the MTD of the combination was determined to be dose level 2 (VEN 600 mg). Twenty-two percent of evaluable patients ( The combination of VEN and L-VCR was found to be safe for patients with r/r ALL and encouraging preliminary efficacy, including MRD negative responses. With the removal of L-VCR from the US market, the phase 2 portion of this trial is actively enrolling with vincristine sulfate.",0
"Characterization of virgin olive oils from two new olive cultivars obtained through controlled crossings on Meski variety was investigated. These two olive varieties have been selected among a progeny of 30 olive descendants after an evaluation of oil fatty acid composition and the content of their fruits. The study was achieved during the crop years 2001/2002 and 2002/2003. These two new cultivars (9D and 6H) had an improved oil composition compared to that of Chemlali, the dominant Tunisian olive oil variety; the latter is characterized by low rate of oleic acid and high rates of linoleic and palmitic acids. New cultivars are distinguished by: (1) good content of total phenols and oil yield; (2) a balanced fatty acid composition; and (3) a good content of OOO and a relatively low ΔECN42 as compared to that of Chemlali.",1
"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) represents a well-established therapeutic strategy for high-risk leukemia, though post-transplant relapse remains a significant challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this retrospective study, we analyzed medical records of 310 pediatric patients (age < 18 years) who underwent HCT for acute leukemias at four Brazilian institutions between 2010 and 2019. The cohort included patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 74.2%) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 25.8%). The median age was 9.52 years (range: 0.25-17.97), with male predominance (68.3%). Total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning was utilized in 72.6% of cases, and bone marrow served as the predominant graft source (74.5%). Prior to transplantation, 46.5% of patients were in first complete remission. Post-transplant relapse occurred in 36.7% of patients at a median of 245 days (range: 38-2,505). With a median follow-up of 2,019 days (5.5 years), overall survival was 69.3% at one year, declining to 62.4% at two years. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 12.6%, 28.8%, and 33.4% at 100 days, one year, and two years post-HCT, respectively. Adjusted analysis revealed increased relapse risk in patients with mixed donor chimerism, positive minimal residual disease (MRD) status before HCT, and disease status beyond first complete remission (including CR2, advanced disease, and refractory disease). These findings underscore the elevated relapse risk associated with advanced disease status, positive pre-HCT MRD, and mixed donor chimerism post-transplant. Future interventions should prioritize improving diagnostic capabilities, expanding access to modern treatment protocols, and facilitating early referral to transplant centers, particularly for aggressive disease presentations.",0
"Anatomical landmark localization (ALL) plays a crucial role in medical imaging for applications such as therapy planning and surgical interventions. State-ofthe- art deep learning methods for ALL are often trained on small datasets due to the scarcity of large, annotated medical data. This constraint often leads to overfitting on the training dataset, which in turn reduces the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-channel generative approach utilizing Flow Matching to synthesize diverse annotated images for data augmentation in ALL tasks. Each synthetically generated sample consists of a medical image paired with a multi-channel heatmap that encodes its landmark configuration, from which the corresponding landmark annotations can be derived. We assess the quality of synthetic image-heatmap pairs automatically using a Statistical Shape Model to evaluate landmark plausibility and compute the Fréchet Inception Distance score to quantify image quality. Our results show that pairs synthesized via Flow Matching exhibit superior quality and diversity compared with those generated by other state-of-the-art generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks or diffusion models. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of integrating synthetic data into the training process of an ALL network. In our experiments, the ALL network trained with Flow Matching-generated data demonstrates improved robustness, particularly in scenarios with limited training data or occlusions, compared with baselines that utilize solely real images or synthetic data from alternative generative models.",0
"Several polyphenols have been tested in grape berries from Spain. The flavonoid content is important because of the pharmacological properties of these compounds, whereas resveratrol has been proved to be an antifungal, antiinflammatory and an anticarcinogenic compound. A reversed-phase HPLC method has been developed and applied to determine resveratrol, quercetine, quercitrine and rutine content in several grape berries samples in a single analysis. Covering the grapes with a preservative paper yields a healthier product, but one which has a lower polyphenol content than unprotected grapes.",1
"Cytogenetic aberrations are found in 65% of adults and 75% of children with acute leukemia. Specific aberrations are used as markers for the prognostic stratification of patients. The current standard cytogenetic procedure for acute leukemias is karyotyping in combination with FISH and RT-PCR. Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a new technology providing a precise identification of chromosomal abnormalities in a single approach. In our prospective study, the results obtained using OGM and standard techniques were compared in 29 cases of acute myeloid (AML) or lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). OGM detected 73% (53/73) of abnormalities identified by standard methods. In AML cases, two single clones and three subclones were missed by OGM, but the assignment of patients to cytogenetic risk groups was concordant in all patients. OGM identified additional abnormalities in six cases, including one cryptic structural variant of clinical interest and two subclones. In B-ALL cases, OGM correctly detected all relevant aberrations and revealed additional potentially targetable alterations. In T-ALL cases, OGM characterized a complex karyotype in one case and identified additional abnormalities in two others. In conclusion, OGM is an attractive alternative to current multiple cytogenetic testing in acute leukemia that simplifies the procedure and reduces costs.",0
"In seed extracts of five oilseed species, in bran extracts of three cereal species, and in seed and/or whole berry extracts of 10 berry species, the concentrations of a large number of lignans and the enantiomeric composition of selected lignans were determined. In the case of sesame and hemp seeds, the lignan content and composition of the whole seeds was compared to that of the hulled seeds. The results showed that cloudberry seeds are the third most lignan-rich food source after linseeds and whole sesame seeds, and that most of the berry species analysed were more lignan-rich than the cereal brans. The lignans are concentrated in the hull of the oilseeds and in the seeds of the berries. In most samples, secoisolarici-, pino-, medio-, and syringaresinol were present as a mixture of two enantiomers.",1
"Cure rates in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) improved using pediatric-based chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation (SCT). However, limited data on the health condition of cured adults are available whereas pediatric data cannot be transferred. The GMALL analyzed the health status in survivors of adult ALL retrospectively. Physicians answered a questionnaire on general condition (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] status) and comorbidity or syndrome occurrence observed after treatment. Five hundred and thirty-eight patients with a median age of 29 (range, 15-64) years at diagnosis were analyzed, median follow-up was 7 (range, 3-24) years. Thirty-one percent had received SCT. ECOG status was 0-1 in 94%, 34% had not developed significant comorbidities. Most frequent comorbidities involved the neurologic system (27%), endocrine system (20%), skin (18%), graft-versus-host-disease (15%), cardiac system (13%), fatigue (13%). SCT impacted ECOG status and comorbidity occurrence significantly. ECOG 0-1 was observed in 86% of SCT and 98% of non-SCT patients (P<0.0001); comorbidity was observed in 87% and 57% respectively (P<0.0001). Our analysis elucidates the spectrum of comorbidities in cured adult ALL patients, with higher risk for transplanted patients, providing stimulations for the design of adequate aftercare programs. Overall, a large proportion of non-SCT patients achieved unrestricted general condition. The data provide a reference for new patient-centered endpoints in future trials.",0
"This study was designed to determine the total phenols (TP) and total antioxidant activity (TAA) of some liquid and solid plant foods that are commonly consumed in Turkey. Total phenols were analysed according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method and antioxidant activities of these compounds in aqueous phase were assessed by measuring their direct ABTS.- radical scavenging abilities. Total phenols varied from 68 to 4162 mg/l for liquid foods and from 735 to 3994 mg/kg for solid foods. TAA of liquid and solid foods ranged between 0.61-6.78 mM and 0.63-8.62 mM, respectively. Total antioxidant activities of foods were well correlated with total phenols (r2 = 0.95). According to content of total phenols per serving, liquid foods were in the order of black tea > instant coffee > coke > red wine > violet carrot juice > apricot nectar > Turkish coffee > grape molasses > sage > white wine > linden flower, and solid foods were in the order of red grape > raisins > tarhana > dried black plum > dried apricot > grape > fresh paprika > fresh black plum > Urtica sp. > cherry > fresh apricot > paprika pickle > paprika paste.",1
"Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran (RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.",1
"Foods of plant origin contain a large number of phytochemicals that may positively affect health. Phytochemicals are largely excreted in urine as metabolites that are formed in host tissues or by the microbiota and constitute a great proportion of the urinary metabolome. The latter can be characterized by a metabolomics approach. In this work, we compared the metabolism of lignins to that of the structurally related ferulic acid (FA) and sinapic acid (SA). Five groups of rats (n = 5) were fed for 2 d a purified diet alone [control (C)] or supplemented with lignin-enriched wheat bran (3% of the diet, wt:wt), poplar wood lignins (0.42%), FA (0.42%), or SA (0.42%). The metabolomes of urine samples collected after 1 and 2 d of supplementation were analyzed by high-resolution MS (liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight). Comparing metabolic fingerprints by gathering semiquantitative information on several hundreds of metabolites and using multivariate statistical analysis (partial least squares for discriminant analysis) showed the similarity between both lignin-supplemented and C groups and confirmed that lignins are largely inert and not absorbed in the body. One the other hand, metabolic fingerprints of the 2 phenolic acid-supplemented groups were clearly distinct from the C group. Differences between the groups were mainly from nonmetabolized FA and SA and metabolites excreted in urine. Thirteen of them were identified as sulfate esters and glucuronide and glycine conjugates of the same phenolic acids, and of dihydrosinapic, vanillic, and benzoic acids. This study shows that metabolomics allows the identification of new metabolites of phytochemicals and can be used to distinguish individuals fed different phytochemical-containing foods.",1
"A sensitive and reliable method was developed for the measurement of simple flavanols in beer by direct-injection High Performance Liquid Chromatography using dual-electrode electrochemical detection. When operated in the amperometric mode the detector was extremely sensitive for readily-oxidized substances such as polyphenols, so that sample preparation was minimal. The dimeric flavanols in a commercial beer were positively identified as procyanidin B3 and prodelphinidin B3. Tentative identifications for three trimeric proanthocyanidins were made also. Collectively, monomeric, dimeric and trimeric flavanols accounted for only about 4% of the colorimetrically determined total polyphenol content, and about 35% of the total flavanol content of a non-haze stabilized beer. The improved chromatographic method was applied to measuring the decreases in simple flavanols caused by treatment of beer with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone.",1
"T-ALL relapse usually occurs early but can occur much later, which has been suggested to represent a de novo leukemia. However, we conclusively demonstrate late relapse can evolve from a pre-leukemic subclone harbouring a non-coding mutation that evades initial chemotherapy.",0
"Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated antioxidant properties of some virgin olive oil phenolic compounds. One of the prerequisites to extrapolate these data to an in vivo situation is the knowledge of their bioavailability in humans. In the present work we describe an analytical method which enables us to perform hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol quantitative determinations in human urine. This method was successfully used in bioavailability studies of both phenolic compounds after acute olive oil administration. Virgin olive oil was administered to healthy volunteers after a low phenolic diet. The dose administered of both phenolic compounds was estimated in reference to free forms of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol present in virgin olive oil extracts before and after being submitted to hydrolytic conditions. These conditions mimic those occurring during digestion. Urine samples were collected before and after acute olive oil intake and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol urinary recovery increased in response to olive oil administration, obtaining maximal values in the first 4 h. Our results further indicate that hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol are mainly excreted in conjugated form, since only 5.9 +/- 1.4% (hydroxytyrosol) and 13.8 +/- 5.4% (tyrosol) of the total amounts excreted in urine were in free form.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological disease that arises from the oncogenic transformation of developing T cells during T-lymphopoiesis. Although T-ALL prognosis has improved markedly in recent years, relapsing and refractory patients with dismal outcomes still represent a major clinical issue. Consequently, understanding the pathological mechanisms that lead to the appearance of this malignancy and developing novel and more effective targeted therapies is an urgent need. Since the discovery in 2004 that a major proportion of T-ALL patients carry activating mutations that turn",0
"An attractive flower from the island of Madagascar has in part saved the lives of thousands of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Random mutations and alterations to the genome led to the evolution of genes encoding enzymes, which would provide the periwinkle flower an arsenal of secondary metabolites to survive within the Madagascar ecosystem. Of the over 200 alkaloid compounds synthesized by the periwinkle, vincristine and vinblastine are the two most well-known being used for chemotherapy treatments, including for children with ALL. The complexities of the multi-step biosynthesis of vincristine and vinblastine, which has taken years to decode, highlight the importance of protecting the vast biodiversity on earth as other natural products that can save lives await to be discovered. This review addresses the discovery of vincristine and vinblastine, as well as the history of their existence, in nature.",0
"Ponatinib is a highly potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor shown to have excellent outcomes in the treatment of acute and chronic leukemias. Despite its high efficacy, ponatinib has been shown to carry an increased risk for cardiovascular adverse events, not attributable to a known mechanism. We present a case of a patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed a cerebrovascular condition while receiving maintenance therapy with the lowest treatment dose of ponatinib for a prolonged duration.",0
"Low bone mineral density is encountered in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) before, during, and after treatment. Prior experience with alendronate, an oral bisphosphonate, demonstrated high tolerability and evident clinical efficacy. However, concerns have been expressed about the long-term safety and utility of such agents in children. Sixty-nine children with ALL received alendronate for a mean of 87 weeks after dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry. Dual-energy radiograph absorptiometry was repeated following the completion of alendronate, and 5 to 9 years later in a subgroup of 32 children. Lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (LS aBMD) Z scores were obtained. The mean LS aBMD Z score rose from -1.78 to-0.47 ( P <0.0001). There was a modest median loss of LS aBMD subsequently in the 32 subjects on long-term follow-up. Almost 80% (N=172) of the children remain in continuous complete remission at a mean of 14.5 years from diagnosis. Of those who received alendronate, which was almost uniformly well tolerated, 7/69 (10.3%) relapsed compared with 19/89 (21.3%) who did not receive the drug. Alendronate appears to be well tolerated and moderately effective in osteopenic children with ALL. Whether it offers protection against relapse of leukemia needs further study.",0
"Recent evidence revealed important interactions between clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and cellular therapies established for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. The impact of CH on safety, efficacy, and outcome of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is currently under investigation. We analyzed 110 patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 105) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 5), treated with Axicabtagene-Ciloleucel (39%), Tisagenlecleucel (51%), or Brexucabtagene autoleucel (10%). Using error-corrected targeted sequencing, a high CH prevalence of 56.4% (variant allele frequency [VAF] ≥1%) at the time of CAR T-cell infusion was detected. The most frequently mutated gene was",0
"B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) can hijack the normal bone marrow microenvironment to create a leukemic niche which facilitates blast cell survival and promotes drug resistance. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) mimic this protective environment in ex vivo co-cultures with leukemic cells obtained from children with newly diagnosed BCP-ALL. We examined the potential mechanisms of this protection by RNA sequencing of flow-sorted MSC after co-culture with BCP-ALL cells. Leukemic cells induced an interferon (IFN)-related gene signature in MSC, which was partially dependent on direct cell-cell signaling. The signature was selectively induced by BCP-ALL cells, most profoundly by ETV6-RUNX1-positive ALL cells, as co-culture of MSC with healthy immune cells did not provoke a similar IFN signature. Leukemic cells and MSC both secreted IFNα and IFNβ, but not IFNγ. In line, the IFN gene signature was sensitive to blockade of IFNα/β signaling, but less to that of IFNγ. The viability of leukemic cells and level of resistance to three chemotherapeutic agents was not affected by interference with IFN signaling using selective IFNα/β inhibitors or silencing of IFN-related genes. Taken together, our data suggest that the leukemia-induced expression of IFNα/β-related genes by MSC does not support survival of BCP-ALL cells but may serve a different role in the pathobiology of BCP-ALL.",0
"Sequential monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) by molecular techniques or multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) has emerged over the past two decades as the primary tool to optimize treatment in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). The aim of our study was to compare the prognostic power of repeated MFC-MRD measurement with single-point MRD assessment in children with BCP-ALL treated with the reduced-intensity protocol ALL-MB 2008. Data from consecutive MFC-MRD at day 15 and day 36 (end of induction, EOI) were available for 507 children with Philadelphia-negative BCP-ALL. They were stratified into standard risk (SR, n = 265), intermediate risk (ImR, n = 211), and high risk (HR, n = 31) according to the initial clinical characteristics defined in the ALL-MB 2008 protocol. Quantitative (relative to quantitative thresholds) and kinetic (logarithmic reduction) assessments of MFC-MRD at both time points effectively separated patients into three groups with different risk of recurrence. On the other hand, starting with low (for the SR group) and moderate (for the ImR group) induction therapy, a single MFC-MRD measurement at EOI proved sufficient to unequivocally identify patients in whom this therapy is highly effective and distinguish them from those who cannot be successfully treated with such therapy. Therefore, initiating treatment with low or moderate treatment from the start, together with careful consideration of initial clinical risk factors and just one EOI-MFC-MRD measurement is simple, inexpensive, and entirely sufficient for treatment optimization. Furthermore, for a large proportion of patients, this approach allows better adjustment, in particular also reduction of therapy intensity than sequential MRD measurements.",0
"The antioxidant activities of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Möench) extracts were evaluated and compared with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) using a β-carotene bleaching assay, a 2,2-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and the Rancimat method. Buckwheat was extracted with solvents of different polarities. The methanol extract showed the highest antioxidant activity coefficient (AAC) of 627±40.0 at 200 mg/l by the β-carotene bleaching method and longest induction time of 7.0±0.2 h by the Rancimat method. The acetone extract showed the highest total phenolics of 3.4±0.1 g catechin equivalents/100 g and the highest scavenging activity of 78.6±6.2% at 0.1 mg/ml by the DPPH method. The properties of the extracting solvents significantly affected the yield, total phenolics and antioxidant activity of buckwheat extract.",1
"This pilot study investigates the absorption and excretion of the flavonoids kaempferol and quercetin in humans after broccoli consumption. Results indicate that kaempferol is absorbed and excreted in urine predominantly as glucuronide or sulfate conjugates, while quercetin is not detected at all. The findings suggest that the metabolism of these flavonoids in humans significantly differs from previous studies in animal models, indicating the need for further research to understand human-specific biotransformation pathways.",1
"Florida celery cultivars Florida 2-14, Florimart, M9, Florida 296, M68, and Junebelle contained total psoralen + bergapten + xanthotoxin + isopimpinellin ranging from about 12 to 50 μg/g. Treatment of the commercial Florida cultivar 2-14 with Bravo 500, Manzate-D, or Kocide 101 fungicides increased bergapten 2−4 times in leaves and stalk, xanthotoxin 2−3 times in stalk, and isopimpinellin about 2−3 times in leaves but did not increase psoralen levels. These increases represent increased calculated biological activity toward human skin. This is the first report of fungicide induction of furanocoumarins in celery.",1
"Cervical hyperextension injury is very frequent with anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) injury, and the ligament damage has a remarkable effect on whether and what type of operation should be performed. This study aims to establish a new scoring system for the accurate diagnosis of ALL damage. The imaging data of the consecutive patients was measured and scored by four radiologists. Intraoperative exploration was performed by three surgeons. The crude and adjusted odds ratios (cOR and aOR) and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were constructed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the scoring system. A total of 255 patients with cervical spine trauma were included in this study. There was no statistical difference in the relationship between demographics and ALL injuries (P > 0.05). Thickness of prevertebral soft tissue (aOR = 11.922, P = 0.004), intervertebral disk angle (aOR = 13.21, P = 0.002), avulsion fracture of the anterior edge of the vertebral body (aOR = 13.844, P = 0.029), ALL disrupted in T1-weighted sequence (aOR = 18.349, P < 0.001), and high signal area in T2-weighted sequence (aOR = 20.898, P = 0.002) had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy. The scoring system's sensitivity and specificity were 94.0% and 88.1%, respectively, and the accuracy was 90.8%. The study established a new scoring system for ALL injuries based on the analysis of a series of clinical data and statistics. A total of five scoring items, a total score of 7 points, and an ALL injury may be diagnosed when the score is not less than 3 points. This scoring system enables an efficient and accurate diagnosis of all injuries.",0
"To evaluate the citation of the ligament in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reports and confirm its presence and injury in the images of exams performed in the acute phase retrospectively. In total, 103 patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in 2019 were included. The images were reanalyzed by two radiologists. In the first analysis, only one report mentioned the anterolateral ligament (ALL) and its injury (0.97%). On reanalysis, ALL was visualized in almost all cases (95% and 97%). An injury was found in 53 (51.5%) cases by radiologist A and in 56 (54.4%) cases by radiologist B. The injury was diagnosed by both in 39 (37.9%) cases (p < 0.0001). Radiologists disagreed regarding the injury (Kappa = 0.411). The reports failed to describe the ligament and diagnose a significant number of injuries. The analysis of conventional resonance images still presents divergences in the diagnosis of ALL injury associated with the ACL among radiologists.

Em primeira análise, apenas um laudo citava o LAL e sua lesão (0,97%); enquanto na reanálise, o LAL foi visualizado em quase todos os casos (95% pelo radiologista A e 97% pelo radiologista B). Foi encontrada lesão em 53 (51,5%) casos pelo radiologista A e 56 (54,4%) pelo radiologista B. Lesão foi diagnosticada por ambos em 39 (37,9%) casos (p < 0,0001). Houve divergência entre os radiologistas com relação à lesão (KappaL = 0,411). Os laudos deixaram de descrever o ligamento e diagnosticar um número significativo de lesões. A análise das imagens convencionais de ressonância ainda gera divergências no diagnóstico da lesão do LAL associada ao LCA entre os radiologistas.",0

This study includes 198 publications reporting 690 patients. Only 1.6% (11) had cancer, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Six cancer patients harbored pathogenic variants within This is the largest investigation of cancer in CFC to date. Cancer risk in the CFC population is elevated but appears limited to earlier childhood. Modest case and cancer numbers could pose limitations to accurately assess cancer risk in CFC and more studies are needed. The review was registered using PROSPERO under the identification tag CRD42023405823 ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=405823 ).",0
"The USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) is the major source of food composition data in the United States. It provides the foundation for most food composition databases in the public and private sectors. As information is updated, new versions of the database are released. This version, Release 23 (SR23), contains data on 7,636 food items and up to 146 food components. It replaces SR22 issued in September 2009. Updated data have been published electronically on the USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory (NDL) web site since 1992. SR23 includes composition data for all the food groups and nutrients published in the 21 volumes of “Agriculture Handbook 8” (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1976B92), and its four supplements (U.S. Department of Agriculture 1990B93), which  superseded the 1963 edition (Watt and Merrill, 1963). SR23 supersedes all previous releases,including the printed versions, in the event of any differences. In July 2001, when NDL converted to a new version of its Nutrient Databank System (NDBS), formats were changed and fields added to improve the descriptive information for food items and the statistical information about the nutrient values. While data in previous releases have been moved to the new NDBS, they may not have been updated through the complete system. Therefore, many of these new fields contain data only for those items that have been processed through the new NDBS and it will take a number of years before they are populated for all food items in the database. Data have been compiled from published and unpublished sources. Published sources include the scientific literature. Unpublished data include those obtained from the food industry, other government agencies, and research conducted under contracts initiated by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS). These contract analyses are currently conducted under the National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program (NFNAP), in cooperation with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and other offices and institutes of the National Institutes of Health (Haytowitz et al., 2008). Data from the food industry represents the nutrient content of a specific food or food product at the time the data is sent to NDL. The values may change due to reformulations or other processing changes by individual companies between the time that SR is released and the next update of SR. Values in the database may be based on the results of laboratory analyses or calculated by using appropriate algorithms, factors, or recipes, as indicated by the source code in the Nutrient Data file. Not every food item contains a complete nutrient profile. ",1
"The anti-oxidant activity of extracts from 36 vegetables was evaluated by using a model system consisting of β-carotene and linoleic acid. The total phenolics of the extracts was determined spectrophotometrically according to the Folin–Ciocalteau procedure and ranged from 34 to 400 mg (100 g)−1 on a fresh weight basis. Mint, aonla, black carrots, chenopodium, fenugreek, kachnar and ginger had high phenolic contents. The anti-oxidant activity expressed as per percent inhibition of oxidation ranged from a high of 92% in turmeric extracts to a low of 12.8% in long melon. Other vegetables found to have high anti-oxidant activity (>70%) were kachnar, aonla, ginger, fenugreek, mint, beetroot, black carrots, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, lotus stem, yam, coriander and tomato. Anti-oxidant activity correlated significantly and positively with total phenolics (r2=0.6578, P < 0.05). The results indicate that vegetables containing high phenolics may provide a source of dietary anti-oxidants.",1
"Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin (norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in vivo.",1
"Anthocyanins, kind of flavonoids (FL) found in plants and vegetables, are known to have varieties of physiological functions. In the present study, we examined absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (Dp3G) in rats. Dp3G appeared in the plasma at 15 min after oral administration as an intact glucosidic form. The plasma level also showed another peak at 60 min. One metabolite peak was detected in the plasma and the structure was assigned as 4'-O-methyl Dp3G (MDp3G) by NMR and MS. The metabolite was also identified in several tissues as a major metabolite especially in the liver. No 3'-O-methyl Dp3G was detected in any tissues, therefore, 4'-OH methylation is the main path of Dp3G metabolism in rats. This finding generalized the metabolic formation of FL having pyrogallol B ring because it has been reported that FL having catechol structure produced 3'-O-methyl-derivatives, but FL having pyrogallol structure produced 4'-O-methyl-derivatives.",1
"Hispanic children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have lower 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) adherence and greater hazard of relapse compared with non-Hispanic White children. We examined the association between Spanish language and 6MP adherence, and hazard of relapse. 6MP adherence was measured electronically over a 6-month period. Participants were grouped by the language of demographic questionnaire completion: Non-Hispanic White-English Speaking (ES, n = 159), Hispanic-Spanish Speaking (Hispanic-SS, n = 59), and Hispanic-ES (n = 109). Hispanic-ES had significantly lower fitted median 6MP adherence compared with non-Hispanic White-ES participants (88.3%, 95% CI = 84.7% to 91.2% vs 95.0%, 95% CI = 93.6% to 96.2%, P < .001). There was no difference in fitted median 6MP adherence between Hispanic-ES and Hispanic-SS participants (88.3%, 95% CI = 84.1% to 91.5% vs 88.3%, 95% CI = 84.7% to 91.2%, P = .9) or adjusted hazard of relapse for Hispanic-SS participants (HR = 0.9, 95%CI = 0.3 to 2.4, P = .8). Spanish language use among Hispanic patients with ALL is not associated with lower 6MP adherence or greater relapse risk. Factors related to Hispanic ethnicity, apart from language, appear to influence adherence.",0
"Rapeseed oil is usually expelled from the seed at high temperatures. Refining removes most of the non-triacylglycerol components, including many sinapic acid derivatives typical for rapeseed. The effect of these phenolic constituents on the oxidative stability of the oil was studied using rapeseed and turnip rapeseed oil samples resulting from different expelling conditions and refinement steps. The polar fraction was isolated, analyzed and tested for antioxidative activity in various lipid oxidation models. The amount of phenols was greatest in the post-expelled crude rapeseed oil, decreasing with an increasing degree of refining. The polar phenol content correlated with oxidative stability. The most active antioxidant component of the polar fraction was identified as vinylsyringol, a decarboxylation product of sinapic acid. This is the first report of vinylsyringol in rapeseed oil. It was abundant in the post-expelled crude oils and apparently responsible for their high phenol content and oxidative stability. Some vinylsyringol was present in the superdegummed oil but not in the fully refined oils.",1
"The bone marrow (BM) niche is a microenvironment where both immune and non-immune cells functionally interact with hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and more differentiated progenitors, contributing to the regulation of hematopoiesis. It is regulated by various signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in its microenvironment. However, despite the strict regulation of BM signals to maintain their steady state, accumulating evidence in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) indicates that leukemic cells can disrupt the physiological hematopoietic niche in the BM, creating a new leukemia-supportive microenvironment. This environment favors immunological evasion mechanisms and the interaction of these cells with the development and progression of BCP-ALL. With a growing understanding of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in the development and progression of BCP-ALL, current strategies focused on ""re-editing"" TIME to promote antitumor immunity have been developed. In this review, we summarize how TIME cells are disrupted by the presence of leukemic cells, evading immunosurveillance mechanisms in the BCP-ALL model. We also explore the crosstalk between TIME and leukemic cells that leads to treatment resistance, along with the most promising immuno-therapy strategies. Understanding and further research into the role of the BM microenvironment in leukemia progression and relapse are crucial for developing more effective treatments and reducing patient mortality.",0
"The effect of cadence in eccentric (ECC) cycling on physiological and perceptual responses is, to date, poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of cadence during ECC cycling on muscular activation (EMG), oxygen consumption (V̇O 2 ), and perceived effort (PE) for two different levels of power output. Seventeen participants completed four sessions 1 wk apart: 1) determination of the maximal concentric peak power output (PPO) and familiarization with ECC cycling at five cadences (30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 rpm); 2) second familiarization with ECC cycling; 3) and 4) ECC cycling exercise consisting of 5 min at the five different cadences at either 40% or 60% PPO. PE was reported, and V̇O 2 and EMG of seven muscles were calculated over the exercise's last minute. PE, V̇O 2 , and global lower limb muscles activation (EMG ALL ) showed an effect of cadence ( P < 0.001) and followed a curvilinear function. Both low and high cadences increased PE and V̇O 2 responses compared with intermediate cadences. Although muscle activation of vastus lateralis follows a U-shaped curve with cadence, it was greater at low cadence for rectus femoris and biceps femoris, greater at high cadence for tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis, and was not altered for soleus. The estimated optimal cadence was greater (all P < 0.01) for V̇O 2 (64.5 ± 7.9 rpm) than PE (61.7 ± 9.4 rpm) and EMG ALL (55.9 ± 9.3 rpm), but power output had no effect on the optimal cadences. The physiological and perceptual responses to changes in cadence during ECC cycling followed a U-shaped curve with an optimal cadence depending on the parameter considered.",0
"Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from SPEs was proposed.",1
"Structural variants drive tumorigenesis by disrupting normal gene function through insertions, inversions, translocations, and copy number changes, including deletions and duplications. Detecting structural variants is crucial for revealing their roles in tumor development, clinical outcomes, and personalized therapy. Presently, most studies rely on short-read data from next-generation sequencing that aligns back to a reference genome to determine if and, if so, where a structural variant occurs. However, structural variant discovery by short-read sequencing is challenging, primarily because of the difficulty in mapping regions of repetitive sequences. Optical genome mapping (OGM) is a recent technology used for imaging and assembling long DNA strands to detect structural variations. To capture the structural variant landscape more thoroughly in the human genome, we developed an integrated pipeline that combines Bionano OGM and Illumina whole-genome sequencing and applied it to samples from 29 pediatric B-ALL patients. The addition of OGM allowed us to identify 511 deletions, 506 insertions, 93 duplications/gains, and 145 translocations that were otherwise missed in the short-read data. Moreover, we identified several novel gene fusions, the expression of which was confirmed by RNA sequencing. Our results highlight the benefit of integrating OGM and short-read detection methods to obtain a comprehensive analysis of genetic variation that can aid in clinical diagnosis, provide new therapeutic targets, and improve personalized medicine in cancers driven by structural variation.",0
"The treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in adults remains a significant therapeutic challenge. While advances in chemotherapy and targeted and immunotherapies have improved overall survival, relapsed or refractory (r/r) adult ALL is associated with poor outcomes. CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a transformative option, achieving high remission rates even in heavily pretreated patients. However, relapse is common. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT), a traditional cornerstone of remission consolidation, may improve long-term outcomes but carries risks of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and morbidity. Most evidence for HCT after CAR T therapy comes from retrospective analyses of subgroups from CAR T cell trials, with small sample sizes and inconsistent data on transplant procedures and outcomes. Despite these limitations, consolidative allo-HCT appears to prolong relapse-free survival (RFS). While overall survival (OS) benefits are in question, extended remission duration has been observed. Nonrelapse mortality (including TRM), ranging from 2.4 to 35%, underscores the need for careful patient selection. Emerging real-world data affirm these findings but highlight the importance of individualized decisions based on disease and treatment history. This review examines current evidence on the sequential use of CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy and allo-HCT in adults with r/r B-ALL.",0
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are genetically heterogeneous malignancies of hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by complex mutations and a high risk of drug resistance and relapse. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are dynamic entities transplanted with leukemia stem cells (LSCs), retaining patients' biological and genetic characteristics. By elucidating LSCs, clonal dynamics, and microenvironment interaction, PDXs facilitate the preclinical evaluation of therapy sensitivity, including immunotherapies, epigenetic therapies, and other agents targeting mutated proteins or apoptosis. The application of PDXs has provided translational evidence for various studies with reliable clinical relevance. Additionally, conventional PDXs remain a robust tool in identifying drug resistance compared with other models, and their potential is further unleashed when examined in large cohorts or combined with novel technologies, which not only enhances our understanding of acute leukemia biology but also enables the discovery and identification of novel biomarkers. In this review, we present the application of PDX models for acute leukemia resistance, including mechanism investigation, therapy evaluation, and associated challenges.",0
"The validation of a HPTLC-densitometric method for the determination of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed was performed improving the reproducibility of a previously reported HPTLC densitometric procedure by the use of fully wettable reversed phase plates (silica gel 60 RP18W F(254S), 10cmx10cm) with MeOH:HCOOH 0.1% (40:60, v/v) mobile phase. The analysis required only the alkaline hydrolysis in aqueous medium of undefatted samples and densitometry at 282nm of HPTLC runs. The method was validated following the protocol proposed by the Société Francaise des Sciences et Techniques Pharmaceutiques (SFSTP) giving rise to a dependable and high throughput procedure well suited to routine application. SDG was quantified in the range of 321-1071ng with RSD of repeatability and intermediate precision not exceeding 3.61% and accuracy inside the acceptance limits. Flaxseed of five cultivars of different origin was elected as test-bed.",1
"During treatment, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receive high doses dexamethasone, which induce acute side effects. To determine the influence of a 5-day dexamethasone course on changes in leptin, fat mass, BMI, hunger, sleep, and fatigue and to explore associations between these changes. Pediatric ALL patients were included during maintenance treatment. Data were collected before (T1) and after (T2) a 5-day dexamethasone course (6 mg/m2/day). At both time points, BMI, fat mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis), and leptin were assessed, as well as parent-reported questionnaires regarding hunger, fatigue, and sleep problems. Changes between T1 and T2 were assessed using paired tests. Correlation coefficients were calculated to assess associations between these changes (Delta scores: T2-T1). Univariable regression models were estimated to study associations between covariates and elevated leptin. We included 105 children, with median age 5.4 years (range, 3.0-18.8). Leptin and fat mass, as well as hunger scores, fatigue, and sleep deteriorated after 5 days of dexamethasone (P < .001), in contrast to BMI (P = .12). No correlations between delta leptin and delta fat mass, BMI, hunger, fatigue, or sleep were found. Elevated leptin on T1 was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.51; 95% CI, 1.28-1.77), higher fat mass (OR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.33), and earlier maintenance week (OR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99). Five days of high-dose dexamethasone treatment led to direct and significant changes in leptin, hunger scores, and fat mass. Since children with ALL are at increased risk for metabolic adverse events, understanding underlying mechanisms is important, and a dexamethasone-induced state of acute leptin resistance might play a role.",0
"The distribution of anthocyanin pigments and polyphenolics in 1 sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) and 3 sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivars was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Changes during frozen storage, canning, and brining were also monitored. Sweet cherry cultivars differed qualitatively with respect to the minor anthocyanins. Hydroxycinnamates are the major class of polyphenolics in sweet cherries, whereas flavanols are in the majority in Montmorency cherries. Hydroxycinnamates were greatly affected by processing and storage, whereas flavonol glycosides were quite stable. Half of the anthocyanins and polyphenolics were transferred to the syrup with canning, and nearly all were transferred to brine during brining.",1
"Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid (major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.",1
"Chemotherapy has been the primary treatment for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, there are still patients who are not sensitive to chemotherapy, including those with refractory/relapse (R/R) disease and those experiencing minimal residual disease (MRD) re-emergence. Chimeric antigen receptor-T lymphocytes (CAR-T) therapy may provide a new treatment option for these patients. Our institution conducted a single-arm prospective clinical trial (ChiCTR-OPN-17013507) using CAR-T-19 to treat R/R B-ALL and MRD re-emergent patients. One hundred and fifteen patients, aged 1-25 years (median age, 8 years), were enrolled, including 67 R/R and 48 MRD re-emergent CD19-positive B-ALL patients. All patients achieved morphologic complete remission (CR), and within 1 month after infusion, 111 out of 115 (96.5%) patients achieved MRD-negative CR. With a median follow-up time of 48.4 months, the estimated 4-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate were 68.7%±4.5% and 70.7%±4.3%, respectively. There were no significant differences in long-term efficacy observed among patients with different disease statuses before infusion (4-year OS: MRD re-emergence vs. R/R B-ALL, 70.6%±6.6% vs. 66.5%±6.1%, p=0.755; 4-year LFS: MRD re-emergence vs. R/R B-ALL, 67.3%±7.0% vs. 63.8%±6.2%, p=0.704). R/R B-ALL patients bridging to transplantation after CAR-T treatment had a superior OS and LFS compared to those who did not. However, for MRD re-emergent patients, there was no significant difference in OS and LFS, regardless of whether they underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or not. CD19 CAR-T therapy effectively and safely cures both R/R B-ALL and MRD re-emergent patients.",0
"We present a case of a 24-year-old female recently diagnosed with acute leukemia who came with complaints of fever for 14 days, progressive lower limb weakness, and multiple episodes of vomiting in the last 1 day. In nerve conduction studies, a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) was established. Fever with thrombocytopenia workup revealed a positive dengue nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) report. Immunophenotyping confirmed pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As leukemia is an immunocompromised state, the peripheral nervous system vulnerability is increased, or infection could precipitate an immune neuropathy. About 10% of adult ALL presents with central nervous system (CNS) leukemias; a higher incidence is seen in mature B ALL. There is some evidence to suggest immunosuppression secondary to intensive chemotherapy (vincristine-induced dying back neuropathy), which was not started in our case. This rare combination in a short period of time with a worsening situation paralyzed the line of management. Few reports described GBS in patients with dengue in adults. The association of Guillan-Barre syndrome and ALL could be coincidental or has a pathophysiological basis and is under basic investigation.",0
"In some European countries there is a legal barrier against the marketing of some citrus juice mixtures under the denomination “orange juice”, as allowed under certain conditions by the FDA for pasteurized and canned orange juice and for frozen concentrated orange juice. For this reason methods have to be developed to determine a juice addition of up to 10% Citrus reticulata and hybrids thereof and up to 5% Citrus aurantium. Using HPLC equipped with a photodiode array (PDA) detector we could establish that a combination of the flavanone glycoside (FG) and polymethoxylated flavone (PMF) pattern offers possibilities. For the flavanone glycosides the method is based on the presence of some specific compounds, on the didymin content, on a divergent ratio of hesperidin on narirutin, and/or on an unidentified component. In other cases, however, an F test applied on the relative PMF pattern offers a better solution calculating the % adulteration probability. We could conclude that, for all examined citrus samples added to Citrus sinensis, it is possible to detect the addition of 10% C. reticulata and hybrids thereof and of 5% C. aurantium.",1
"A fast and simple method has been developed to detect orange juice (Citrus sinensis) falsifications on the basis of the flavanone glycoside pattern. After a short sample preparation procedure, gradient HPLC is used, followed by photodiode array detection. Separation is done by means of a 15 cm Waters Novapak RP 18 column and a mobile phase gradient, partly replacing an aqueous phosphate buffer solution by acetonitrile. Peak identification is based on relative retention times as well as on UV-vis spectra. On the basis of a minimum hesperidin/narirutin ratio of 3, some doubtful technological processes, as further extraction of oranges, may be traced out, as well as the addition of Citrus reticulata and some orange hybrids",1
"This article presents an enhanced segmentation methodology for the accurate detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in blood smear images. The proposed approach integrates color correction techniques with HSV color space segmentation to improve white blood cell analysis. Our method addresses common challenges in microscopic image processing, including sensor nonlinearity, uneven illumination, and color distortions. The key objectives of this study are to develop a robust preprocessing pipeline that normalizes blood smear images for consistent analysis, implement an HSV-based segmentation technique optimized for leukocyte detection, and validate the method's effectiveness across various ALL subtypes using clinical samples. The proposed technique was evaluated using real-world blood smear samples from ALL patients. Quantitative analysis demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to traditional methods. Our approach shows strong capability in reliably detecting and segmenting ALL subtypes, offering the potential for enhanced diagnostic support in clinical settings.",0
"Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether we could detect polyphenols and their metabolites in a spot urine sample in a free-living human population and whether it was related to those observed in 24-h urine samples, for potential use as a biomarkers of polyphenol intake.",1
"Glucocorticoids represent a key element in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lead to adrenal suppression. We aimed to assess the differential response profile of adrenal steroids in children with ALL during BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster) induction treatment. Therefore, we performed liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based steroid profiling of up to seven consecutive leftover morning serum samples derived from 11 patients (pts) with ALL before (day 0) and during induction therapy at days 1-5, 6-12, 13-26, 27-29, 30-35 and 36-40. 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), 11-deoxycortisol (11S), cortisol, 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), corticosterone and aldosterone were determined in parallel. Subsequently, steroid concentrations were normalized by multiples of median (MOM) to adequately consider pediatric age- and sex-specific reference ranges. MOM-cortisol and its precursors MOM-11S and MOM-17OHP were significantly suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment until day 29 (P < 8.06 × 10-10, P < 5.102 × 10-5, P < 0.0076, respectively). Cortisol recovered in one of four pts at days 27-29 and in two of five pts at days 36-40. Among the mineralocorticoids, corticosterone was significantly suppressed (P < 3.115 × 10-6). Aldosterone and DOC showed no significant changes when comparing day 0 to the treatment time points. However, two ALL patients with ICU treatment due to the sepsis showed significantly lower MOM-DOC (P = 0.006436) during that time and almost always the lowest aldosterone compared to all other time points. Suppression of mineralocorticoid precursors under high-dose glucocorticoid therapy suggests a functional cross talk of central glucocorticoid regulation and adrenal mineralocorticoid synthesis. Our data should stimulate prospective investigation to assess potential clinical relevance.",0
"A method was established for fast and easy analysis of 5-n-alkylresorcinols in rye grains, considering effects of milling (intact grains versus flour), extraction solvent (ethyl acetate, methanol and acetone), extraction volume per gram of sample (20 and 40 ml) and extraction time (3, 6, 18 and 24 h). For intact kernels, extraction of 1 g samples with ethyl acetate (40 ml, 24 h) is recommended. The ease of extraction is consistent with the presence of alkylresorcinols in the outer layers of the kernel and their absence in the endosperm. The extracts were analysed (without further purification or derivatisation) by gas chromatography using methyl behenate (C22:0, fatty acid methyl ester) as internal standard. Alkylresorcinols were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and the major homologues were found to contain alkyl chains of C17:0, C19:0, C21:0, C23:0 and C25:0. The methodology was then applied to analyse the alkylresorcinol content in 15 rye cultivars grown at two locations in Sweden. Total alkylresorcinol contents varied within the range 549–1022 µg g−1, and the average percentages of the different alkylresorcinols were: 17:0, 23%; 19:0, 32%; 21:0, 26%; 23:0, 11%; and 25:0, 8%.",1
"JAK2 rearrangement (JAK2-R) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is rare and often categorized as B-ALL with BCR::ABL1-like features based on the World Health Organization classification. We report 10 patients with JAK2-R ALL, 9 males and 1 female, with a median age 40.5 years. Eight patients presented with marked leukocytosis (median WBC, 63 × 10",0
"T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1) is one of the most frequently deregulated oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Its deregulation can occur through diverse cis-alterations, including SIL-TAL1 microdeletions, translocations with T-cell Receptor loci, and more recently described upstream intergenic non-coding mutations. These mutations consist of recurrent focal microinsertions that create an oncogenic neo-enhancer accompanied by activating epigenetic marks. This observation laid the groundwork for an innovative paradigm concerning the activation of proto-oncogenes via genomic alterations of non-coding intergenic regions. However, for the majority of T-ALL expressing TAL1 (TAL1+), the deregulation mechanism remains 'unresolved'. We took advantage of H3K27ac and H3K4me3 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data of eight cases of T-ALL, including five TAL1+ cases. We identified a putative novel oncogenic neo-enhancer downstream of TAL1 in an unresolved monoallelic TAL1+ case. A rare but recurrent somatic heterozygous microinsertion within this region creates a de novo binding site for MYB transcription factor. Here we demonstrate that this mutation leads to increased enhancer activity, gain of active epigenetic marks, and TAL1 activation via recruitment of MYB. These results highlight the diversity of non-coding mutations that can drive oncogene activation.",0
"The polyphenol trans-resveratrol (t-RES) is present as t-RES-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, termed piceid, in several plant-derived foods. Although data on the metabolism and on in vivo effects of t-RES have been reported, quantitative data on the metabolites formed after dietary intake of t-RES or piceid are still lacking. In this study, 85.5 mg of piceid per 70 kg of body weight (bw) were administered to healthy volunteers in a bolus dose. t-RES metabolites formed in plasma and urine were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS, NMR, and HPLC-DAD analysis using chemically synthesized t-RES conjugate standards. In addition, the amount of t-RES metabolites bound noncovalently to plasma proteins was determined for the first time in humans. The metabolites identified and quantified were t-RES-3-sulfate, t-RES-3,4'-disulfate, t-RES-3,5-disulfate, t-RES-3-glucuronide and t-RES-4'-glucuronide, with t-RES-sulfates being the dominant conjugates in plasma and urine. Besides these metabolites, two novel t-RES-C/O-conjugated diglucuronides have been identified and quantified in plasma and urine. Moreover, it could be shown that up to 50% of the plasma t-RES-3-sulfate, t-RES-disulfates, and the novel t-RES-C/O-diglucuronides were bound to proteins. Total recovery of the dietary administered piceid in urine ranged between 13.6 and 35.7%.",1
"Phenolic composition of 92 wine vinegars produced from different wines from the south of Spain (Jerez, Montilla, El Condado) is determined by HPLC with diode array detection. Pattern recognition techniques were applied to distinguish between different methods of elaboration (slow traditional methods with surface culture or quick methods carried out in bioreactors with submerged culture) or wines employed as substrate. Multivariate analysis of data includes principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as well as artificial neural networks trained by back-propagation (BPANN). The classification depending on the acetification process leads to good recalling rates in both LDA (mean = 92.5) and BPANN (mean = 99.6). With respect to the classification on the basis of the geographical origin, the obtained recalling rates were 88.8 for LDA and of 96.5 for BPANN (mean values).",1
"The effects of traditional nixtamalization and extrusion cooking on total phenolics, ferulic acid, anthocyanins and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Mexican pigmented (blue and red) and commercial (white and yellow) maize processed into tortillas were investigated. Tortillas prepared from extruded flours retained between 76.2–93.9% and 58–96.7% of total phenolics and total ferulic acid (TFA) respectively, compared to 50.5–75.7% and 19.6–55.8% assayed in traditional tortillas. Approximately 97–99% of TFA in raw kernels and their tortillas was in its bound form. The retention of TFA in traditional tortillas was significantly lower compared to tortillas from extruded flours. Traditional tortillas contained more free ferulic acid compared to tortillas produced from extruded flours indicating that the first process liberated bound ferulic acid with cell walls more efficiently. Blue maize lost more than 55% of the anthocyanins when processed into extruded or traditional tortillas. Approximately 68–92% of the ORAC associated with raw kernels or their tortillas was due to bound compounds. Traditional and extruded tortillas lost 16.4–52.4% and 6.8–24.8%, respectively, of the total ORAC associated with raw grains. Results clearly indicate that the proposed lime-cooking extrusion strategy was instrumental in retaining higher levels of phytochemicals, particularly ferulic acid, and antioxidants in all tortillas.",1
"The antiradical activity of dry beans was evaluated in order to assess the validity of this test and to correlate the results with those achieved with the Folin-Ciocalteu method and with a rapid spectrophotometric method for the analysis of total flavonoids. Four landraces (12 samples) of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), collected in two regions of Italy (Tuscany and Basilicata) in three different years, were analyzed. The EC50 values ranged from 39 to 2810 mg sample/mg 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazil radical. The phenolic content of each sample was expressed as gallic acid equivalents; it changed from 1.17 to 4.40 mg/g. The flavonoid content, expressed as mg of (+)-catechin per g of dry seeds, ranged from 0.24 to 1.43 mg/g. The qualiquantitative composition of polyphenols has been also elucidated by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-diode array detection and HPLC/MS. These investigations showed that rapid tests can contribute to assessing the quality of functional food.",1
"Understanding the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin is essential in special populations, such as pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), in light of previous studies indicating that ALL patients have a lower volume of distribution than non-ALL patients. Furthermore, validation of such results is needed to ensure their clinical application. Accordingly, this single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study compares the pharmacokinetic parameters of volume of distribution and clearance (Cl) of gentamicin between ALL and non-ALL patients. Inclusion criteria were pediatric patients aged between 1 and 14 years with or without ALL and receiving intravenous gentamicin for treatment courses > 72 h. Patients' characteristics, such as age, sex, height, serum albumin, diagnosis, serum creatinine (Scr) concentration, dosing, and pharmacokinetic information, including peak and trough concentrations, were retrieved. The study scrutinized a total of 115 pediatric patients, comprising toddlers (15.7 %), children (76.5 %), and adolescents (7.8 %). All patients received gentamicin every 8 h, with an average dose of 2.50 (0.64) mg/kg. Patients were divided into two groups based on disease state, with 45.2 % (n = 52) in the non-ALL group and 54.8 % (n = 63) in the ALL group. Both groups had similar characteristics in terms of gender, weight, body surface area, and dose. The only significant covariates identified were weight and creatinine clearance (Cl",0
"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) represents an important and potentially curative treatment option for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Relapse continues to remain the most important factor influencing overall survival post allo-HCT. We discuss early identification, clinical manifestations, and management of relapsed disease. Routine evaluation of measurable residual disease (MRD) and change in donor chimerism play a crucial role in early detection. Pivotal clinical trials have led to FDA approval of multiple novel agents like blinatumomab and inotuzumab. Combining targeted therapy with cellular immunotherapy serves as the backbone for prolonging overall survival in these patients. Donor lymphocyte infusions have traditionally been used in relapsed disease with suboptimal outcomes. This review provides insight into use of cellular therapy in MRD positivity and decreasing donor chimerism. It also discusses various modalities of combining cellular therapy with novel agents and discussing the impact of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in the setting of post allo-HCT relapse both as consolidative therapy and as a bridge to second transplant.",0
"Anterior tibial subluxation (ATS) of the lateral compartment entails a pathological tibiofemoral alignment in knees with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. Causes of increased ATS after an acute ACL injury are not clear, but soft tissue abnormalities and bony variations of the knee are potential causes. To determine whether increased ATS of the lateral compartment in knees with acute ACL injury is associated with (1) anterolateral ligament (ALL) status and (2) inherent anatomy of the lateral femoral condyle (LFC) and lateral tibial plateau (LTP). Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. A total of 337 patients with clinically diagnosed ACL injuries treated between September 2019 and August 2021 were retrospectively reviewed, and 119 patients with acute ACL injury were included. Of them, 79 patients with impaired ALL (ALL injury group) and 40 patients with intact ALL (ALL intact group) were identified based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ATS of the lateral compartment measured on MRI was compared between the 2 groups. The bony anatomy of knees, quantified by the LFC length, LFC height, LTP length, and LTP slope, was also evaluated on MRI and correlated with the ATS with partial correlation coefficients. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify the independent predictors of increased ATS. The ATS of the lateral compartment in the ALL injury group was significantly larger than that in the ALL intact group (6.3 mm vs 4.0 mm, respectively; An impaired ALL increased the ATS of the lateral compartment after acute ACL injuries. In patients with combined ALL injuries, a flatter LFC and a steeper LTP in the sagittal plane were predictors of a further increase in ATS.",0
"High-yielding varieties of green gram (Vigna radiata L.), namely Asha and MH1K-25 contained a significant amount of antinutrients. Various processing and cooking methods, namely soaking, dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and sprouting, decreased the level of antinutrients and improved in vitro digestibility of protein and in vitro availability of calcium, iron and zinc observed. The beneficial effect was more pronounced with pressure-cooked and soaked seeds followed by ordinary cooking, sprouting (24 h), dehulling and soaking in both cultivars. A significant increase in in vitro protein digestibility (34–35%), in vitro availability of Ca (59–61%), Fe (52–56%) and Zn (62–67%) may be ascribed to the reduced content of phytic acid (35–39%), polyphenols (41–42%) and trypsin inhibitor activity (69–70%). Pressure cooking was the most effective treatment in improving the nutritional quality of green gram.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an uncommon and rapidly progressing blood cancer originating in the bone marrow, characterized by the abnormal proliferation of immature lymphocytes. Although most cases of ALL are observed in children, the disease pattern shows two peaks: one in early childhood and another around the age of 50. Approximately a fifth to a third of adults diagnosed with ALL exhibit cytogenetic abnormalities involving the Philadelphia chromosome. Despite the existence of several studies on Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ ALL), our case accentuates the use of a multi-disciplinary approach to treatment and involves a patient from a unique demographic.",0
"A microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method has been applied for the first time to the extraction of the main lignan, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), and the two most concentrated hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in flaxseed. The effects of microwave power, extraction time and alkaline treatment were investigated. It was shown that a 3 min MAE resulted in an SDG content of 16.1+/-0.4 mg/g, a p-coumaric acid glucoside content of 3.7+/-0.2 mg/g and a ferulic acid glucoside content of 4.1+/-0.2 mg/g. These values were compared with those obtained using conventional extraction methods and the results demonstrated that MAE was more effective in terms of both yield and time consumption.",1
"A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of a caffeic acid derivative, rosmarinic acid, and the main flavone and flavanone glycosides in leaves of Mental×piperita, namely eriocitrin, luteolin 7-O-rutinoside, hesperidin, isorhoifolin, diosmin, eriodictyol 7-O-glucoside, and narirutin. The last two were identified for the first time in M.×piperita and Mentha genus, respectively. Forty cloner, belonging to the three varieties of M.×piperita, were investigated. The eight phenolic constituents are present in all clones. The flavonoid content of the leaves ranged from 8.6 to 11.8% on dry weight basis",1
"Musashi-2 (MSI2), implicated in the oncogenesis and propagation of a broad array of malignancies, inclusive of certain leukemia, remains a nascent field of study within the context of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using lentiviral transfection, ALL cells with stable MSI2 knockdown were engineered. A suite of analytic techniques - a CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and western blotting - were employed to evaluate cellular proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis and to confirm differential gene expression. The suppression of MSI2 expression yielded significant results: inhibition of cell proliferation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis in ALL cell lines. Furthermore, it was noted that MSI2 inhibition heightened the responsiveness of ALL cells to dexamethasone. Significantly, the depletion of MSI2 prompted the translocation of GR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon dexamethasone treatment, consequently leading to enhanced sensitivity. Additionally, the FOXO1/4 signaling pathway contributed to the biological effects of ALL cells evoked by MSI2 silencing. Our study offers novel insight into the inhibitory effects of MSI2 suppression on ALL cells, positing MSI2 as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of ALL.",0
"The Group for Research in Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL)-2014 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02617004, NCT02619630) evaluated an intensive, age-adapted protocol for adults aged 18-59 years with Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The trial was motivated by findings from the previous GRAALL-2005 study, which reported excessive toxicity from pediatric-inspired therapy in older patients and no added benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) in those with an early favorable response to treatment. Thus, the GRAALL-2014 protocol aimed to reduce treatment-related toxicity in patients aged ≥45 years and to limit alloHSCT to patients with poor measurable residual disease (MRD) responses. A total of 743 patients was included, and outcomes were compared to those of the GRAALL-2005 trial. The GRAALL-2014 demonstrated reduced early mortality and higher complete remission rates in patients aged ≥45 years. MRD-guided transplant decisions reduced alloHSCT indications by approximately 50%. While older patients experienced a higher cumulative incidence of relapse, no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) was observed compared to historical cohorts across age subgroups. The overall 4-year DFS was 57.1% (95% CI, 53.4-61.1). Notably, 4-year overall survival improved significantly, from 65.5% (95%CI, 61.7-69.8) to 71.7% (95%CI, 67.7-76.0) in younger patients (p=0.031) and from 49.6% (95%CI, 43.5-56.5) to 59.5% (95%CI, 53.5-66.3) in older patients (p=0.011). These findings highlight the value of individualized treatment strategies, balancing efficacy and safety. Future studies should investigate the integration of immunotherapy to further reduce treatment intensity and improve outcomes.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has transformed the treatment landscape for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL). However CAR T-cell therapy of R/R T-ALL has unique challenges, such as the lack of specific tumor antigens, cell fratricide and T cell aplasia, in comparison with that of R/R B-ALL. Despite promising therapeutic outcomes in R/R B-ALL, application of this therapy is limited by high relapse rates and immunological toxicities. Recent studies suggest patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation post-CAR T-cell therapy would achieve durable remission and better survival, but this remains controversial. Herein, I briefly review published data on the clinical use of CAR T-cells in treating ALL.",0
"High-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection was used to characterize the phenolic profile of apricot fruits, juices and jams. Chlorogenic acid was the major phenolic compound present in all samples. Quercetin 3-rutinoside was the main flavonoid and kaemp-ferol 3-rutinoside was present in smaller amounts with traces of other quercetin and kaempferol glycosides. Quantitative differences in phenolics were observed in eleven apricot fruit varieties at three stages of maturity and also in some processed apricot products. A common phenolic profile was observed in all cases. The major portion of the flavonoids occurred in the skin of the fruit and the total phenolic content of apricot fruits had no influence over the softening behaviour observed in some varieties.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common pediatric cancer marked by uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts, primarily affecting children aged two to five years. While treatment success rates have reached 90% in children, challenges such as therapy toxicity and relapse persist. The gut microbiome, known to impact immune function, is often disrupted in ALL patients, potentially worsening with treatments like chemotherapy and antibiotics. Research suggests probiotics may help restore microbial balance and mitigate side effects, with certain strains showing promise in reducing gastrointestinal symptoms; however, their use requires caution in immunocompromised patients due to infection risks. Probiotics could improve treatment outcomes in ALL, but further research is needed to establish safe, standardized protocols for use in this sensitive population.",0
"Thoracic epidural analgesia has traditionally been used for pain management after open abdominal surgery, but its use has declined. The quest for efficient alternatives has resulted in the increasing use of regional techniques. These can be applied as single-shot or continuous blocks using catheters. Long-acting liposomal bupivacaine could preclude the use of catheters. This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided abdominal wall blocks with liposomal bupivacaine for open abdominal surgery. Medline ALL, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar were systematically searched. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent researchers. Inclusion criteria were (1) liposomal bupivacaine in ultrasound-guided abdominal wall blocks for open abdominal surgery, (2) outcome of pain and/or opioid consumption, (3) patients >18 years, and (4) reports published in English. Of the 1277 studies found, 22 met the inclusion criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (Version 2) tool was used to assess randomized controlled trials. Studies were grouped for clarity. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks were mostly investigated. Data were heterogenic regarding types of surgery, approach to block placement, anesthetic solution injected, and use of intrathecal morphine (ITM). Patients undergoing cesarean section with neuraxial anesthesia and intrathecal morphine benefit from TAP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine, demonstrating reduced opioid consumption and comparable pain. Evidence for other open abdominal surgeries was inconclusive. Abdominal wall blocks with liposomal bupivacaine could be a viable alternative when epidural analgesia is contraindicated.",0
"High hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HeH ALL), one of the most common childhood malignancies, is driven by nonrandom aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome numbers) mainly comprising chromosomal gains. In this study, we investigate how aneuploidy in HeH ALL arises. Single cell whole genome sequencing of 2847 cells from nine primary cases and one normal bone marrow reveals that HeH ALL generally display low chromosomal heterogeneity, indicating that they are not characterized by chromosomal instability and showing that aneuploidy-driven malignancies are not necessarily chromosomally heterogeneous. Furthermore, most chromosomal gains are present in all leukemic cells, suggesting that they arose early during leukemogenesis. Copy number data from 577 primary cases reveals selective pressures that were used for in silico modeling of aneuploidy development. This shows that the aneuploidy in HeH ALL likely arises by an initial tripolar mitosis in a diploid cell followed by clonal evolution, in line with a punctuated evolution model.",0
"To determine the factors affecting the first 100 days of survival in acute leukaemia patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). Descriptive study. Place and Duration of the Study: Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from March 2016 to February 2022. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in complete remission (CR) undergoing Allo-HSCT were included. Data were collected on patient demographics, diagnosis, remission status, pre-transplant analysis, donor compatibility, conditioning regimen, GVHD prophylaxis, engraftment times, post-transplant complications, mortality causes, and overall survival (OS) at 100 days. Among 101 transplant recipients (mean age of 24 ± 11.05 years; n = 76 males, n = 25 females), 41 had AML and 60 had ALL. Ninety patients underwent matched sibling donor (MSD)-HSCT, while 11 had haplo-identical sibling-HSCT. Patients ≤13 years had higher survival rates than older patients (94.4% vs. 67.5%, p = 0.03). High pre-transplant serum ferritin levels (>2500 mg/dl) predicted lower OS (48.9% vs. 100% in ferritin <1000 mg/dl, p <0.01). AML patients had a survival advantage over ALL patients (82.9% vs. 65%, p = 0.05). Early neutrophil engraftment within 14 days correlated with better survival (96.4% vs. 54.3%, p <0.01). Lastly, severe mucositis also adversely affected survival (60% in Grade III vs. 9.5% in Grade IV, p <0.01). Identifying modifiable factors can improve long-term support and follow-up, enhancing the patient outcomes in underdeveloped nations.

"The changes in total phenol content and antioxidant capacity were monitored in six industrial dark fruit juices during 29-day refrigerated storage. The initial total phenol values ranged from 1302.1 mg/L GAE (strawberry) to 1919.8 mg/L GAE (black currant) with a mean of 1573.3 mg/L GAE. All juices exhibited fluctuations in TP values with a marked increase after 48 hours in refrigerated storage, and a greater overall TP content in 5/6 studied juices after 29 days. Antioxidant capacity was evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging assay and cyclic voltammetry (CV) and expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Black currant juice exhibited the highest TEAC values according to both CV (2.42 mM Trolox) and the DPPH assay (5.68 mM Trolox), while cranberry juice antioxidants exhibited the greatest storage stability and the smallest antioxidant capacity decrease on day 29, 20% (CV) and 15% (DPPH assay). At the end of 29-day storage 5/6 juices exhibited a significant loss in antiradical activity and all 6 juices exhibited a significant loss in TEAC derived from CV measurements. Significant linear correlation was observed between the results of CV measurements and the DPPH antiradical activity (r2 = 0.62).",1
A valid method using liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry was established for the study of the absorbed and metabolic components of a Chinese medicine 'Shuangdan' granule in rat plasma after oral administration. The plasma samples were acidified with 1M hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data. The results proved that the established method could be used to identify the structure of active components responsible for the pharmacological effects of 'Shuangdan' granule.,1
"A rapid method based on RP-HPLC with UV detection is presented for the quantitative determination of five major flavonoid aglycons, viz. quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, luteolin, and apigenin, in freezedried vegetables and fruits, after acid hydrolysis of the parent glycosides. Completeness of hydrolysis and extraction have been optimized by testing systematically different conditions such as acid concentration, reaction period, and methanol concentration in the extraction solution using samples containing various types of flavonoid glycosides. Optimum hydrolysis conditions are presented for flavonol glucuronides, flavonol glucosides, and flavone glycosides. Identity of the flavonoids was confirmed with diode array. Repeatability of the method was good, with coefficients of variation of 2.5-3.1 % for quercetin, 4.6-5.6% for kaempferol, 4.6% for myricetin, 3.3% for luteolin, and 2.8% for apigenin. CV of the within-laboratory reproducibility was less than 2 times the CV of repeatability. Recoveries of the flavonols quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin ranged from 77 to 11095, and recoveries of the flavones apigenin and luteolin ranged from 99 to 106 5%. The method presented allows a fast, quantitative, and reproducible determination of five flavonoids in freeze-dried foods.",1
"The present study is a systematic review of factors and consequences of parental distress following their children's acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis. PubMed, Web of Science, and APA PsycInfo databases were searched. Twenty-eight papers were included, with only three longitudinal studies. Fifteen studies explored factors of parental distress, including sociodemographic, psychosocial, psychological, family, health, and ALL-specific variables. Correlations were found between social support, illness cognitions, coping strategies, and parental distress, as well as contradictory results regarding sociodemographic variables. Family cohesion and the overall impact of illness were associated with parental distress. Resilience factors contributed negatively to parental distress symptoms, and perceived caregiver strain and negative child's emotional functioning contributed positively. Thirteen papers explored the consequences of parental distress, including psychological, family, health, and social/education factors. Distress was correlated with care burden and contributed to family strain, child's symptom burden, and parental protective behavior. Significant correlations were found between parental distress, at diagnosis, and further adjustment of parents and children. Most papers reported correlations between parental distress and psychological condition and quality of life; few studies reported no association. Correlations between maternal depression and child's participation in education and social life were found. Differences on distress were found regarding parents' gender, age, children's group risk, and treatment phases. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the phenomenon and its consequences. Future interventions should address parents' mental health needs in an early and ongoing assessment in order to promote healthier outcomes.

"The traditional Greek diet is dominated by the high consumption of olive oil, fruit and vegetables. Antioxidants represent a common element in these foods and may be important mediators of the beneficial effect of this diet. Wild edible greens are frequently consumed throughout Greece. Seven edible wild greens and traditional Cretan green pies were analyzed for their nutritional composition and flavonoid content, in particular flavonols and flavones. A high nutritional value and a low energy value characterize the wild greens. These wild greens have a very high flavonol content when compared with regular fresh vegetables, fruits and beverages commonly consumed in Europe. Rumex obtusifolius was found to contain twice the amount of quercetin contained in onions. Two pieces of Cretan green pie (100 g) contain approximately 12 times more quercetin than one glass of red wine (100 ml) and three times more quercetin than a cup of black tea (200 ml). Wild greens potentially are a very rich source of antioxidant flavonols and flavones in the Greek diet.",1
"Literacy is one of the most important skills a students can achieve, as it provides access to information and communication. Unfortunately, literacy skills are not easily acquired, especially for students with intellectual disabilities who require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). There are many barriers to literacy acquisition, some due to low expectations from parents and teachers and lack of evidence-based reading programs and reading materials adapted for AAC. Barriers as a result of extensive support needs is also a real factor. This trial aims to deliver reading instructions to 40 students with intellectual disabilities who require AAC and contribute in the debate on how to best support this population through reading instructions to maximizes their reading skills. Forty non-verbal or minimally verbal students (age 6-14) with intellectual disabilities who require AAC will be part of a reading intervention with a multiple single-case design with four randomized baselines. The intervention period will last for 18 months and will commence in March 2023. The students will receive the intervention in a one-to-one format, working systematically with a reading material that contains phonological awareness and decoding tasks based on the Accessible Literacy Learning (ALL) developed by Janice Light and David McNaughton. All the teachers will be trained to deliver the reading intervention. The reading material ""Lesing for alle"" (Reading for all) is based on and follow the strategies behind the research of ALL. The current trial will through a reading intervention contribute to move beyond only teaching sight words and combine several reading components such as sound blending, letter-sound correspondence, phoneme segmentation, shared reading, recognition of sight words, and decoding. The strategies and methods in use is built on the existing science of reading, especially what has been effective in teaching reading for students with intellectual disabilities who require AAC. There is limited generalizability of prior findings in reading-related phonological processing interventions to different populations of them who use AAC specially outside of the USA. More research is needed to understand how programs designed to improve reading skills across other settings understand the program's long-term effects and to study the effectiveness when delivered by educators who are not speech language therapists or researchers.

"Forty-one apple samples, representing eight of the most widely cultivated varieties in western Europe, were collected in Trentino, Italy. Samples were extracted from fresh fruit with a mixture of acetone/water to achieve a good extraction of polyphenols, including proanthocyanidin oligomers which were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC. Up to 20 compounds including catechin, epicatechin, B2 procyanidin, hydroxycinnamates, flavonols, anthocyanins, and dihydrochalcones were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC and LC-MS. Total polyphenol content was independently measured with an optimized Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The mean content of total polyphenols lay between 66.2 and 211.9 mg/100 g of FW depending on the variety. With chromatographic analysis, it was possible to explain the whole amount of total polyphenols measured by the FC assay. Flavanols (catechin and proanthocyanidins) are the major class of apple polyphenols (71-90%), followed by hydroxycinnamates (4-18%), flavonols (1-11%), dihydrochalcones (2-6%), and in red apples anthocyanins (1-3%).",1
"The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.",1
"Leukemia is the fifth most common cancer in Saudi Arabia. The aim of this study was to assess the various patterns of leukemia associated with age, gender, and nationality in this region. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the regional laboratory in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, from April to November 2023. Descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies and percentages by using the GraphPad Prism software. This study included 107 patients, and the results showed that leukemia cases were higher in males than females and more prevalent in older patients (above 50 years of age). Overall, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) were the most common types of leukemia among Saudi patients. In addition, AML was the most prevalent type of leukemia in males and females, followed by ALL. Data also revealed that ALL was the most common type in the younger population, whereas AML was highly prevalent in older patients. In conclusion, this study provides valuable information about the patterns of leukemia reported at the regional laboratory in Makkah and will help in designing management and preventive approaches for these patients. This epidemiological investigation is also valuable for establishing proper medical databases.",0
"Dexamethasone is crucial in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment, however, studies regarding the pharmacokinetics of dexamethasone and its metabolites are scarce. Our study conducted a comprehensive pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of dexamethasone and metabolite, examining their association with dexamethasone-induced toxicity. Peak and trough concentrations were collected during the maintenance phase from pediatric ALL patients who received oral dexamethasone (6mg/m2/day). NONMEM was used to study the population pharmacokinetics including covariates. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) correlations between drug and its active metabolite exposure and adverse effects were examined. 382 samples (dexamethasone: n = 191; 6β-hydroxydexamethasone: n = 191) from 104 children (age range 3.0 -18.8 years) were collected. A one-compartment model described the data best. The estimated apparent dexamethasone total clearance was 26 L/h/70 kg with 18 % inter-individual variability, and an apparent volume of distribution of 123 L/70 kg, yielding a half-life of 3.3 h. Covariate analysis demonstrated that when asparaginase was co-administered, there was a 50 % reduction in both the clearance of dexamethasone and the extent to which dexamethasone was metabolized to 6β-hydroxydexamethasone. A statistically significant but weak positive correlation was observed between dexamethasone drug exposure and fasting hunger scores. Dexamethasone exposure significantly increased with asparaginase co-administration by inhibition of the CYP3A4 pathway. Our study found a statistically significant but weak positive correlation between dexamethasone exposure and increased hunger. These results support the need for more studies on how to personalize dexamethasone dosing in pediatric ALL treatment and adjust doses to limit side effects, especially in case of co-medication.",0
"Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT) using a γ-retroviral vector (γ-RV) is an effective treatment for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency due to Adenosine Deaminase deficiency. Here, we describe a case of GT-related T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) that developed 4.7 years after treatment. The patient underwent chemotherapy and haploidentical transplantation and is currently in remission. Blast cells contain a single vector insertion activating the LIM-only protein 2 (LMO2) proto-oncogene, confirmed by physical interaction, and low Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) activity resulting from methylation of viral promoter. The insertion is detected years before T-ALL in multiple lineages, suggesting that further hits occurred in a thymic progenitor. Blast cells contain known and novel somatic mutations as well as germline mutations which may have contributed to transformation. Before T-ALL onset, the insertion profile is similar to those of other ADA-deficient patients. The limited incidence of vector-related adverse events in ADA-deficiency compared to other γ-RV GT trials could be explained by differences in transgenes, background disease and patient's specific factors.",0
"Limited information is available concerning the qualitative and quantitative composition of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, in almonds. We determined total phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in California almond (Prunus dulcis) skins and kernels among the principal almond varieties (Butte, Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price) with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection and UV detection. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry under identical HPLC conditions was utilized to verify identities of the predominant flavonoids and phenolic acids. Total phenols ranged from 127 (Fritz) to 241 (Padre) mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight. The analyses were compiled to produce a data set of 18 flavonoids and three phenolic acids. The predominant flavonoids were isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (in combination), catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside at 16.81, 1.93, 1.17, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.50 mg/100 g of fresh weight almonds, respectively. Using the existing approach of calculating only the aglycone form of flavonoids for use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database, whole almonds would provide the most prevalent aglycones of isorhamnetin at 11.70 (3.32), kaempferol at 0.60 (0.17), catechin at 1.93 (0.55), quercetin at 0.72 (0.20), and epicatechin at 0.85 (0.24) mg/100 g of fresh weight (mg/oz serving), respectively. These data can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action underlying the relationship between almond consumption and health-related outcomes and provide values for whole and blanched almonds suitable for inclusion in nutrient databases.",1
"[13C]Caffeic acid and [13C]ferulic acid were synthesized and then used as internal standards for the determination of these acids (free and esterified) in oatmeal. A comparative study indicated that 84% of the ferulic acid, but only 32% of the caffeic acid, which is more susceptible to oxidation than the former, could be found by a conventional analytical approach.",1
"The significance of endogenous immune surveillance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains controversial. Using clinical B-ALL samples and a novel mouse model, we show that neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cells are induced to adopt type-1 regulatory (Tr1) function in the leukemia microenvironment. Tr1s then inhibit cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, preventing effective leukemia clearance. Leukemic cells induce Tr1s by phenocopying hematopoietic stem cells, which normally are subject to effective surveillance by this CD4+ subset. This mechanism effectively redirects Tr1 cells from a role in preventing cancer to maladaptively promoting clinical relapse. In mouse models, addition of IL10R blockade to cytotoxic therapy modestly affected Tr1 development but was insufficient to improve leukemia control. In contrast, combined therapy with a cytotoxic agent and anti-PDL1 blockade eradicated measurable residual disease. This correlates with polarization of the neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cell population from Tr1 towards Th1 states. Our findings uncover a mechanism that enables leukemic relapse and resolves existing controversies on the role of immune surveillance towards this cancer type. Therapeutic polarization of neoantigen-specific CD4+ T-cells away from Tr1 and towards Th1 states may improve contemporary immune therapies by reshaping the immune microenvironment towards states permissive for cytotoxic attack of residual leukemia.",0
"To understand the impact of multicomponent interventions to improve recovery of older adults following planned hospital treatment, we conducted two systematic reviews, one of quantitative and one of qualitative evidence, and an overarching synthesis. These aimed to: • understand the effect of multicomponent interventions which aim to enhance recovery and/or reduce length of stay on patient-reported outcomes and health and social care utilisation • understand the experiences of patients, carers and staff involved in the delivery of interventions • understand how different aspects of the content and delivery of interventions may influence patient outcomes. We searched bibliographic databases including MEDLINE ALL, Embase and the Health Management Information Consortium, CENTRAL, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, conducted forward and backward citation searching and examined reference lists of topically similar qualitative reviews. Bibliographic database searches were completed in May/June 2021 and updated in April 2022. We sought primary research from high-income countries regarding hospital inpatients with a mean/median age of minimum 60 years, undergoing planned surgery. Patients experienced any multicomponent hospital-based intervention to reduce length of stay or improve recovery. Quantitative outcomes included length of stay and any patient-reported outcome or experience or service utilisation measure. Qualitative research focused on the experiences of patients, carers/family and staff of interventions received. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool or an adapted version of the Wallace checklist. We used random-effects meta-analysis to synthesise quantitative data where appropriate, meta-ethnography for qualitative studies and qualitative comparative analysis for the overarching synthesis. Quantitative review: Included 125 papers. Forty-nine studies met criteria for further synthesis. Enhanced recovery protocols resulted in improvements to length of stay, without detriment to other outcomes, with minimal improvement in patient-reported outcome measures for patients admitted for lower-limb or colorectal surgery. Qualitative review: Included 43 papers, 35 of which were prioritised for synthesis. We identified six themes: 'Home as preferred environment for recovery', 'Feeling safe', 'Individualisation of structured programme', 'Taking responsibility', 'Essential care at home' and 'Outcomes'. Overarching synthesis: Intervention components which trigger successful interventions represent individualised approaches that allow patients to understand their treatment, ask questions and build supportive relationships and strategies to help patients monitor their progress and challenge themselves through early mobilisation. Interventions to reduce hospital length of stay for older adults following planned surgery are effective, without detriment to other patient outcomes. Findings highlight the need to reconsider how to evaluate patient recovery from the perspective of the patient. Trials did not routinely evaluate patient mid- to long-term outcomes. Furthermore, when they did evaluate patient outcomes, reporting is often incomplete or conducted using a narrow range of patient-reported outcome measures or limited through asking the wrong people the wrong questions, with lack of longer-term evaluation. Findings from the qualitative and overarching synthesis will inform policy-making regarding commissioning and delivering services to support patients, carers and families before, during and after planned admission to hospital. This trial is registered as PROSPERO registration number CRD42021230620. This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme (NIHR award ref: 130576) and is published in full in More patients aged 60 or over need planned surgery. These patients are more likely to experience difficulties, such as urinary infections or falls, whilst in hospital, so should not spend more time in hospital than necessary. Hospitals use strategies that shorten hospital stay, but we do not know how older patients, or carers, feel about these, or whether they help patients recover in the long term. We wanted to know: how leaving hospital sooner affects how older patients feel and recover after planned surgery; how older patients, carers and staff feel about strategies designed to support older patients to go home earlier; which parts of these hospital care strategies work best? We brought together research about hospital care strategies that shorten the length of time older patients spend in hospital. We looked at patient questionnaires and interviews with patients, carers and hospital staff. Patients and carers helped us plan our research, understand our findings and consider who to share these with. hospital strategies to reduce hospital stay achieve this, without increasing risk of complications; information and follow-up care for patients and carers after discharge are essential; strategies which consider the individual needs of patients and help them understand their treatment, focus on their recovery goals and develop supportive relationships with staff were linked to better outcomes; lots of studies were excluded because they did not use patient questionnaires. Studies using questionnaires often focused on aspects of care delivered whilst patients were in hospital. Carers’ voices were often overlooked. Research is needed to develop patient questionnaires to more fully capture the experiences of patients and carers and support hospitals to develop care strategies focused on the needs of individual patients and carers.",0
"This work investigates the content of feruloylquinic (FQA), caffeoylquinic (CQA) and dicaffeoylquinic (diCQA) acids in the peel, pulp and seed of 22 tropical fruits from Brazil. 3-CQA, 4,5-diCQA and 4- and 5-FQA were not detected in any of the fruits analysed. Relatively small amounts of 4-CQA (4.0–48.7 mg kg−1) were found in the peel and/or pulp of seven of the fruits; only the peel of Artocarpus heterophyllus was significantly (p < 0.05) richer in this acid (1000 mg kg−1). The distribution of 3,4- and 3,5-diCQA in different parts of the fruits was relatively poor, only reaching levels of up to 16.4 mg kg−1. The peel of A heterophyllus also showed the highest amount of 5-CQA (13 000 mg kg−1), while the seed of most fruits generally contained a lower amount of this acid than the peel or pulp. On the basis of the 5-CQA content found in the pulp, 15 of the fruits were classified as follows: very low concentration (4.4–15.8 mg kg−1), low concentration (28.9–66.4 mg kg−1), medium concentration (132 mg kg−1), high concentration (473–474 mg kg−1) or very high concentration (1730 mg kg−1); however, no 5-CQA was detected in the pulp of the other seven fruits. Thus 5-CQA was the major chlorogenic acid present in most of the tropical fruits studied and was generally accompanied by small amounts of 4-CQA and 3,4- and 3,5-diCQA.",1
"We have developed and validated a highly specific, versatile antibody to the extracellular domain of human LGR5 (α-LGR5). α-LGR5 detects LGR5 overexpression in >90% of colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pre-B-ALL tumour cells and was used to generate an Antibody-Drug Conjugate (α-LGR5-ADC), Bispecific T-cell Engager (α-LGR5-BiTE) and Chimeric Antigen Receptor (α-LGR5-CAR). α-LGR5-ADC was the most effective modality for targeting LGR5",0
"In Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (LLA), growing evidence has accumulated regarding the efficacy of low-intensity and chemo-free regimens. Our objective was to analyze all recent trials evaluating these treatments and to compare them in terms of efficacy. We applied the Shiny method, an artificial intelligence technique, to analyze Kaplan-Meier curves and reconstruct patient-level data. Reconstructed patient data were then evaluated through standard survival statistics and subjected to indirect head-to-head treatment comparisons. The endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Based on 432 reconstructed patients, eight trials were analyzed. The survival data from these trials were pooled into three types of treatments: (i) treatments based on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) combined with reduced-intensity chemotherapy (denoted as TKICHE); (ii) TKIs associated with steroids with no chemotherapy (TKISTE); (iii) chemotherapy-free combinations of blinatumomab plus TKIs (TKIBLI). According to the Shiny method, the three PFS curves were reported in a single Kaplan-Meier graph and subjected to survival statistics. In terms of PFS, TKIBLI ranked first, TKICHE second, and TKISTE third; the differences between these three regimens were statistically significant. This multi-treatment Kaplan-Meier graph, generated through the Shiny method, summarized the current evidence on these treatments in both qualitative and quantitative terms.",0
"Acute leukemia (AL) is a diverse group of hematological malignancies characterised by the accumulation of immature blast cells in the bone marrow. Accurate classification into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is essential for treatment and prognosis. This study aimed to assess the performance of glass slide morphology (GSM) using a light microscope versus whole slide imaging (WSI) in diagnosing and classifying AL, using flow cytometry as the gold standard test. Peripheral smears and bone marrow aspirates from 97 patients suspected of AL were stained with Romanowsky stain and reviewed by a single hematologist. For GSM, the hematologist was provided with a single slide, which was to be evaluated under a light microscope. For WSI, the Alexapath mobile scanner (ADA1) was used to scan the slides for review by the hematologist. Patient identification was concealed from the interpreting hematologist, and an interval of 2 weeks was set between the review of GSM and WSI of the same patient. The sensitivity and specificity of GSM and WSI were compared to the results of flow cytometry. Out of the 97 patients suspected to have AL, 47 were confirmed to have AL by flow cytometry. Among these, 19 (40.4%) were diagnosed with AML and 28 (59.6%) with ALL. GSM demonstrated high sensitivity (89.4%) and specificity (90.0%) for diagnosing AL, but lower sensitivity in distinguishing AML (57.9%) from ALL (75.0%). Similarly, WSI exhibited a reasonable sensitivity (80.9%) and high specificity (98.0%) for diagnosing AL, but lower sensitivity in differentiating AML (57.9%) and ALL (46.4%). GSM and WSI are reasonable and acceptable techniques for accurately screening AL cases and accelerating referral to tertiary centers of excellence.",0

"Flavanone glycosides (FG) found in citrus juices have been separated and quantitatively determined by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) using a C18 packed column and water-acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran-glacial acetic acid eluent system. The influence of juice pH on hesperidin and narirutin determinations, from commercial orange juices, has been studied at different pH values (from 2.0 to 6.2). The response factors, averages, relative standard deviations, and recoveries of six FG were determined using LC with an UV detector at 280 nm. The six FG and three unknown compounds found in citrus juices were determined in 124 samples of lemons, limes, grapefruits, and sweet oranges. The major FG in each citrus group were as follows: in lemon and lime, eriocitrin (47-94 mg L-1) and hesperidin (84-196 mg L-1); in sweet orange, narirutin (30-84 mg L-1) and hesperidin (235-407 mg L-1); in grapefruit, narirutin (33-161 mg L-1) and naringin (113-481 mg L-1). Factorial discriminant analysis of the data obtained effectively differentiated lemon and lime and varieties of grapefruits (white, pink, red, and green) and sweet oranges (Valencia, navel, blood, Thomson, and Malta).",1
"A lignan compound, P3, having strong antioxidative activity was found to be formed in high concentration during the industrial bleaching process of unroasted sesame seed oil. P3 (named sesaminol) was identical to a minor constituent previously isolated from acetone extract of sesame seed. It was shown that sesamolin in unprocessed sesame oil is the source of seaseminol, and the formation of seasaminol was confirmed by the model experiment with corn oil to which sesamolin had been added. Sesaminol was not so greatly removed by the deodorization process that follows bleaching as was sesamol, and it was shown to be at a concentration of ca. 100 mg/100g in commercial refined unroasted seed oil. The antioxidative activity of sesaminol was foughly equal to those of sesamol and γ-tocopherol by the thiocyanate method. Therefore, it seems that the antionxidative activity of refined unroasted seed oil is mainly attributed to sesaminol.",1
"Combining an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with an anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction results in significant advantages including reduced graft rupture rates, a lower risk of reoperation for secondary meniscectomy, improved knee stability, and higher rates of return to preinjury levels of sport. The previously reported indications for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction are as follows: ACL reconstruction revision; high-grade pivot shift test; long-term ACL rupture; young patients; pivoting activities; concomitant medial meniscus repair, and, specifically, regarding the ALL repair, it must be an acute surgery (within 15 days from injury). Several modern techniques have been described to repair and reconstruct the ALL. This technical note details a number of these techniques performed by the Scientific Anterior Cruciate Ligament Network International (SANTI) Study Group. First, we describe a combined ACL reconstruction and double-bundle ALL reconstruction using hamstring autograft. Secondly, we describe a single-bundle ALL reconstruction using gracilis autograft. Thirdly, we describe an ALL reconstruction technique using a knotless soft anchor, which provides shallow fixation and prevents tunnel convergence. Finally, we describe a technique for ALL repair. Several techniques have been described to repair and reconstruct the ALL, all offering significant advantages over an isolated ACL reconstruction.

"Lysosomes are dynamic organelles integral to cellular homeostasis, secretory pathways, immune responses, and cell death regulation. In cancers, lysosomes become dysregulated to sustain proliferative signaling, metabolism, and invasion. In hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), leukemia cells demonstrate lysosome dysregulation with increased lysosomal activity, mTORC1 signaling, catabolic reactions, and autophagy. This supports the survival, metabolism, and proliferation of the leukemia cells. Lysosomes also play a critical role in treatment resistance by promoting cell survival and sequestration of drugs. This has led to the development of lysosome-targeted therapies such as cationic amphiphilic drugs (CAD), ATPase inhibitors or autophagy inhibitors to treat hematological malignancies. Lysosome-targeted treatments have shown effectiveness at inducing cell death by inhibiting cell survival mechanisms and inducing apoptosis. In addition, the combination of lysosome-targeted therapies with standard treatments gives synergistic apoptotic responses in leukemia cells. In this review, we will describe the lysosomal functions, their dysregulation in hematological malignancies and the development of lysosomal targeted therapies for leukemia treatment. By understanding lysosome dysregulation and developing lysosome-targeted agents, innovative treatment strategies could be effective in overcoming drug resistance in hematological malignancies.",0
"Little is known about maternal occupational exposure to hydrocarbons and offspring cancer risk. We aimed to estimate childhood cancer risk associated with maternal exposure to aliphatic/alicyclic, aromatic, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, and methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and toluene. In this case-control study, all cancer cases (N = 10 442) diagnosed at less than 20 years (born 1968-2016) in Denmark were matched to 261 050 cancer-free controls (25 : 1 matching ratio). Maternal exposure during pregnancy was determined from a job-exposure matrix. We performed unconditional logistic regression to estimate cancer risks from hydrocarbon exposures, adjusting for maternal age, maternal birthplace, and the child's birthplace. For medulloblastoma, we observed strong associations with maternal occupational exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.33, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29-4.20] including the individual solvents: trichloroethylene (aOR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.08-2.88) and methylene chloride (aOR: 1.62, 95% CI: 0.98-2.68). The risk of medulloblastoma also increased with maternal exposure to aliphatic/alicyclic hydrocarbons (aOR: 1.78, 95% CI: 0.99-3.20), aromatic hydrocarbons (aOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 0.93-2.89), and toluene (aOR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.04-3.22). The risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) increased with exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons (aOR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.09-3.51). The strongest association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was observed for aromatic hydrocarbons (aOR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.07-1.71). We saw increased risks in medulloblastoma, NHL, and ALL in offspring of mothers occupationally exposed to solvents in pregnancy over a span of 50 years in Denmark. We encourage maternal workplace safety measures that reduce exposures in pregnancy to improve children's health.",0
"Quantification of measurable residual disease (MRD) correlates with the risk of leukemia recurrence in adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, it remains unknown whether collecting data on cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2) transcript levels, after completing the second course of consolidation, improves prognosis prediction accuracy. A total of 204 subjects with B-cell ALL were tested for CSPR2 transcripts after completing the second course of consolidation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and divided into high (N = 32) and low (N = 172) CSRP2 expression cohorts. In multivariable analyses, subjects with high expression of CSRP2 had a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.38-4.76; P = 0.003), lower 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR = 3.22, 95% CI 1.75-5.93; P < 0.001), and overall survival (OS) (HR = 4.59, 95% CI 2.64-7.99; P < 0.001) in the whole cohort, as well as in the multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC) MRD-negative cohort (for CIR, HR = 2.70, 95% CI 1.19-6.12; for RFS, HR = 4.37, 95% CI 1.94-9.85; for OS, HR = 4.90, 95% CI 2.43-9.90; all P < 0.05). Prognostic analysis showed that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) could significantly improve the prognosis of patients with high CSRP2 expression (allo-HSCT vs chemotherapy: 5-year CIR, 52% vs 91%; RFS, 41% vs 9%; OS, 38% vs 20%; all P < 0.05). Our data indicate that incorporating data from CSPR2 transcript levels to the MRD-testing at the end of the second course of consolidation therapy enhances prognosis prediction accuracy in adults with B-cell ALL.",0
"The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final beverage, suggesting the need for further study.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy in which activating mutations in the Notch pathway are thought to contribute to transformation, in part, by activating c-Myc. Increased c-Myc expression induces oncogenic stress that can trigger apoptosis through the MDM2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Since the great majority of T-ALL cases carry inactivating mutations upstream in this pathway but maintain wildtype MDM2 and TP53, we hypothesized that T-ALL would be selectively sensitive to MDM2 inhibition. Treatment with idasanutlin, an MDM2 inhibitor, induced only modest apoptosis in T-ALL cells but upregulated the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain genes BAX and BBC3, prompting us to evaluate the combination of idasanutlin with BH3 mimetics. Combination treatment with idasanutlin and navitoclax, a potent Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor, induces more consistent and potent synergistic killing of T-ALL PDX lines in vitro than venetoclax, a Bcl-2 specific inhibitor. Moreover, a marked synergic response to combination treatment with idasanutlin and navitoclax was seen in vivo in all four T-ALL xenografts tested, with a significant increase in overall survival in the combination treatment group. Collectively, these preclinical data show that the combination of idasanutlin and navitoclax is highly active in T-ALL and may merit consideration in the clinical setting.",0
"Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) assessment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is crucial for relapse prediction and treatment guidance. Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) enhances detection but faces limitations due to insufficient leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) and antigen modulation. This study explores new markers to improve MFC-based MRD detection in B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL). Expression-patterns of seven aberrancy markers, i.e., CD44, CD304, CD73, CD86, CD123, CD99, CD58, and one B-cell maturation marker, CD22, were studied in 143 samples with leukemic-blasts from sixty-one childhood BCP-ALL patients and in hematogones of 20 non-leukemic bone marrow (BM) samples using fourteen-color MFC. The highest relative frequences of LAIPs amounted to 82.50%, reported for CD99 and CD58, followed by CD44 (81.10%), CD73 (76.20%), CD22 (73.40%), CD304 and CD86 (68.50%), while the lowest relative frequence was CD123 (44.40%). Differential expression of CD58, CD304, and CD73 in diagnostic samples was highly significant (",0
"Polyphenolic content and radical-scavenging activities (RSA) of four sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) cultivars were characterized after storage at optimal (15 degrees C) or low temperature (5 degrees C) for 0, 13, 26, and 37 days. The polyphenolic content increased during storage in three cultivars but not in 'Murasakimasari'. The change in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) correlated very well with polyphenolic content. The increases in polyphenolics and the RSA in 'Benimasari' were significantly greater during storage at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. The main polyphenolic components in all cultivars were chlorogenic acid (ChA) and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA). ChA level increased more at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, whereas that of 3,5-diCQA was greater at 15 degrees C. Caffeoylquinic acids and RSA in 'Murasakimasari', which contains a large amount of anthocyanin in flesh tissue, were extremely high at the beginning of storage and remained nearly constant or decreased over time. A non-caffeoylquinic acid component that increased during storage, especially in 'J-Red' at 15 degrees C, was purified by successive chromatographic steps. The isolate was identified as caffeoyl sucrose [CSu, 6-O-caffeoyl-(beta- d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1))-alpha-D-glucopyranoside] by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). These results suggest that storage under cultivar-dependent, controlled temperature is one approach for increasing desirable physiologic function associated with RSA of polyphenolic compounds in sweet potato roots.",1
"Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol (17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol (20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.",1
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) are two of the most prevalent hematological malignancies diagnosed among adult leukemia patients, with both being difficult to treat and associated with high rates of recurrence and mortality. In the present study, bioinformatics approaches were used to analyze both of these types of leukemia in an effort to identify characteristic gene expression patterns that were subsequently validated",0
"Acute leukemia with gene mutations, particularly TP53, is associated with poor prognosis, yet their impact in middle-aged and elderly patients remains insufficiently explored. This study evaluated the prevalence and prognostic significance of TP53 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This retrospective cohort study included 93 adult patients diagnosed with AML ( TP53 mutations were detected in 16 patients (17.2%). The median age was 56.50 years for TP53 This study shows that TP53 mutations significantly worsen the prognosis of acute leukemia. Routine TP53 mutation screening should be integrated into clinical practice to refine risk stratification and guide treatment, while prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and explore targeted therapies.",0
"Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.",1
"Glycosylated kaempferol derivatives from the external leaves of tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC) characterized by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD-MS/MS-ESI were kaempferol 3-O-sophorotrioside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O- (methoxycaffeoyl/caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophorotrioside-7-O-sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-tetraglucoside-7-O-sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl/caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl/caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophorotrioside, kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl)sophorotrioside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, and kaempferol 3-O-glucoside. These acylated derivatives are reported for the first time in nature, with the exception of kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside. Quantification of the identified compounds was achieved by HPLC-DAD and carried out in samples cultivated under conventional or organic practices and collected at different times. In general, samples from organic production exhibited higher total phenolics content than those from conventional practices collected in the same period.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive tumor mainly affecting children and adolescents. It is driven by multiple genetic mutations that together define the leukemic phenotype. Interestingly, based on genetic alterations and/or deregulated expression, at least six genetic subgroups have been recognized. The TAL/LMO subgroup is one of the most represented genetic subgroups, characterizing 30-45% of pediatric T-ALL cases. The study of lipid and metabolic profiles is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for comprehending the development and progression of tumors. In this study, metabolic and lipidomic analysis via LC/MS have been carried out on four T-ALL cell lines belonging to the TAL/LMO subgroup (Jurkat, Molt-4, Molt-16, and CCRF-CEM) to identify new potential metabolic biomarkers and to provide a subclassification of T-ALL cell lines belonging to the same subgroup. A total of 343 metabolites were annotated, including 126 polar metabolites and 217 lipid molecules. The statistical analysis, for both metabolic and lipid profiles, shows significant differences and similarities among the four cell lines. The Molt-4 cell line is the most distant cell line and CCRF-CEM shows a high activity in specific pathways when compared to the other cell lines, while Molt-16 and Jurkat show a similar metabolic profile. Additionally, this study highlighted the pathways that differ in each cell line and the possible enzymes involved using bioinformatic tools, capable of predicting the pathways involved by studying the differences in the metabolic profiles. This experiment offers an approach to differentiate T-ALL cell lines and could open the way to verify and confirm the obtained results directly in patients.",0
"We present a case of Ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) affecting left thigh in a child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with an aim to raise awareness about this condition. A 7-year-old female child who presented with lethargy, pallor and lumps to inner lip was diagnosed with B-cell precursor ALL. She was started on treatment as per UKALL 2011 guidelines Regime B. On day 28, she developed neutropenic sepsis along with a new lesion in her left thigh. She was started on intravenous Meropenum, Gentamicin and Caspofungin. The clinical diagnosis of EG was made based on lesion progression, positive blood and wound swab & tissue cultures for EG occurs in 1-30% of cases of Pseudomonas sepsis; other bacteria and fungi can be associated with this condition. It is identified more in oncology patients as seen in our patient. A multidisciplinary team approach should be provided in 3 stages with empirical antibiotics, followed by targeted antibiotics or antifungals & surgical debridement. Our patient was treated in similar fashion and made a good recovery. It is a rare skin condition associated with a high mortality. We suggest all clinicians to be vigilant about this condition to be able to provide accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment to improve the overall prognosis.",0
"The diagnosis of blast cell presence in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in acute leukemias (AL) is made using techniques such as flow cytometry (FCM) and conventional cytology (CC). This study aims to evaluate CSF blast cell presence frequency in LA using both techniques (CC and FCM) in our center. We analyzed three hundred and eight CSF samples belonging to 175 patients, 57% male, with a median age of 46 years (1-70 years) were analyzed. Diagnoses were acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL, 84%), acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL 5%), acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML, 11%). The immunophenotype was performed with an 8-color panel adapted to the diagnosis. The proportion of non-assessable CSF samples in LA was higher for CC (46%) than FCM (4%) (p<0.05). Overall, infiltration was found in 78/308 samples by FCM (25.3%) and in 8/77 by CC (10.4%) (p<0.0001). Seventy of 259 samples were positive in B-ALL (27%) and 6/34 in AML (17%). There were no CC+ cases in AML or T-ALL. The samples that were FCM+/CC+ had more significant infiltration (59.5%) than CMF+/CC-ones (30%) (p<0.0001). CMF detects more than twice as many CSF blast-positive cases in LA as CC and is, therefore, suitable for routine use along with CC.",0

"The flavonoid composition of three phenotypes of ""Zolfino"" landraces, a typical bean grown in Tuscany, has been elucidated by means of HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analysis. Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a nutritional point of view.",1
"Cleft lip and palate (CLP) abnormalities are common birth defects encompassing isolated cleft lip, cleft palate, or combined CLP. Current knowledge indicates that CLP has both genetic and environmental causes, with strong associations between a positive family history and maternal factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, teratogenic substance use, and poor nutrition. The upper lip develops as a result of the fusion of the paired medial nasal prominences to the maxillary prominences, forming the philtrum and lateral portions of the upper lip, respectively. Cleft lip, therefore, arises from a failure in those named structures to fuse. The current best treatment involves surgical repair to reconstruct the lip to restore normal appearance and function, including feeding and speech. This normally occurs around the age of six months (standard time) in most centers, but is performed much earlier, in the neonatal period, in other centers. This study aims to determine whether neonatal cleft lip repair is superior to standard time repair. Secondary aims are to determine both the feasibility and the safety of neonatal repair. Advanced literature searches were carried out using Medline ALL (1946 to date) and Embase (1974 to date); 11 articles were deemed relevant and included in this study. Aesthetic results showed excellent outcomes with neonatal repair with regard to the appearance of the scar, facial (lip and nasal) symmetry, but those aesthetic results are no better than those achieved at standard time. Although early intervention can be beneficial as early repair takes place when the cleft is less severe and when the tissues are more malleable, making the surgery less challenging, and when some aspects of fetal scar healing remain. Additionally, early repair has a positive impact on the development of the alveolar projections and can assist in reducing an alveolar cleft if present, improving the aesthetic outcome. Moreover, neonatal surgery carries with it no greater risk than surgery carried out at six months and will allow feeding to begin at an early stage, promoting recovery. Early repair also brings with it a large positive psychosocial impact, where infants and mothers can build a normal relationship from an early stage. Later in life, children and adults will be less self-conscious following good aesthetic repair. In conclusion, based on the limited available evidence, neonatal repair may be recommended over standard time repair.",0
"The metabolic products of daidzein and genistein, the principal isoflavones of soy, were examined. Six volunteers included soy into their normal diet for a 2-week period and urine samples were analyzed before and after soy consumption. Isolation and characterization of the urinary metabolites were carried out with absorption chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS). The structures of the isoflavones isolated were confirmed by using authentic reference compounds. Dihydrogenistein, 6'-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, and cis-4-OH-equol were identified, in addition to known isoflavonoids daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the known metabolites equol, O-desmethylangolensin, and dihydrodaidzein, by comparing the retention times and the spectra of the urinary compounds with those of the synthesized reference standards. The mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol were also identified. Derivatization of the isoflavones for GC-MS was examined by comparing two silylating reagents, N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and pyridine:hexamethyldisilazan:trimethylchlorosilane (QSM), both used for the derivatization of these compounds. The silylation experiments revealed significant differences in the compositions of the derivatization products. Some corrections were made concerning the earlier published data of dihydrogenistein and 6'-OH-O-dma.",1
"A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids (benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric (0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free acid.",1
"This paper describes an interference-free reversed-phase HPLC procedure for the simultaneous quantification of 5-HMF, furfural, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and caffeine in green and roasted coffee samples. The sample preparation was simple, only involving a boiled water extraction followed by filtration. The chromatographic separation was achieved using a reversed-phase column Spherisorb ODS2 (5mm; 25.0 × 0.46 cm). Gradient elution was carried out using water+acetic acid (0.2%) (A) and methanol (B). The effluent was monitored by a diode-array detector and chromatograms were recorded at 280 nm. The determinations were performed in the linear ranges 0.25–10 mg/mL, 0.1–10 mg/mL, 2.5–100 mg/mL, 0.25–200 mg/mL for 5-HMF, furfural, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and caffeine, respectively. Extensive quality assurance of the method was performed by the standard additions method in both coffee matrices (green and roasted coffee). For roasted coffee, the precision obtained (n=10) was better than CV% 0.52, 0.62, 0.14, and 0.50 for 5-HMF, furfural, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and caffeine, respectively; for green coffee, it was better than 0.76 for 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 0.89 for caffeine. For roasted coffee samples, recovery values were between 85 and 104%, 87 and 103%, 88 and 94%, and 74 and 77% for 5-HMF, furfural, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and caffeine, respectively. For green coffee sample, recovery values were between 73 and 74% for 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and between 94 and 98% for caffeine.",1

"Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is associated with a poor prognosis, making its accurate detection vital for treatment planning. This systematic review critically examines the role of conventional cytomorphology (CC) and multiparameter flow cytometry (FC) in analyzing cerebrospinal fluid in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. While CC remains the gold standard, its sensitivity is limited, particularly in cases with low cell counts. FC offers greater sensitivity in identifying cases of 'occult' CNS disease (FC+/CC-). Pre-analytical variables, such as CSF volume, processing time, and preservation techniques, also influence the accuracy of both methods. Despite the advantages of FC, challenges remain, including the lack of standardized positivity criteria and unclear prognostic implications and management strategies for occult CNS disease (FC+ and CC-). Future research is needed to establish uniform diagnostic guidelines and to assess the clinical relevance of occult CNS disease in ALL.",0
"There are limited data pertaining to the prognostic features and optimal therapeutic approach for the 20%-25% of children with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LLy) who have the B-lymphoblastic subtype. Outcomes are favorable following treatment modeled after acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens, but prognosis is dismal after relapse, and there are no established features for predicting therapy response. Ongoing US and international trials will include the largest cohort of uniformly treated patients with B-LLy to date, providing an opportunity to define clinical and molecular predictors of relapse and to establish a standard of care for treatment to improve outcomes for this rare pediatric cancer.",0
"The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo antioxidant effects.",1
"Methotrexate (MTX) is essential for treating lymphoblastic leukemia, but high doses (5 g/m To analyze the associations between body composition (body fat mass, visceral fat area, and skeletal muscle mass) and the incidence of MTX toxicity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma. A cohort of patients aged 6-18 years diagnosed with ALL and lymphoblastic lymphoma who received high-dose MTX without prior toxicity was included. Patients with preexisting renal failure or liver failure before MTX administration were excluded. Body composition was assessed using a multifrequency bioimpedance device. Regarding MTX toxicity, 30.2% of events occurred early, and this figure increased to 58.7% for late toxicity. Patients with a visceral fat area (VFA) ≥47 cm A VFA ≥ 47 cm",0
"To investigate the temporal trends and factors associated with outpatient rehabilitation utilization and costs for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Deidentified administrative claims data and longitudinal health information on patients representing a mixture of ages, ethnicities, and geographic regions across the United States were accessed using Optum Labs Data Warehouse. Regression models were constructed to assess associations of outpatient rehabilitation with age, sex, race and ethnicity, year of diagnosis, and region. Outpatient rehabilitation. 1000 Patients aged 1-30 years with a new diagnosis of ALL between 1993 and 2017 and continuous insurance coverage (N=1000). Not applicable. Outpatient rehabilitation service utilization and cost based on reimbursed charge codes, summarized over 36 months after cancer diagnosis. In 1000 patients, utilization of outpatient rehabilitation services increased from 20% in 1993-2002 to 55% in 2013-2017. In the earliest era examined, physical and/or occupational therapy was provided to 18% and increased to 54% in the latest years. Speech service utilization remained between 5%-8% across timepoints. Inflation-adjusted cost for provision of services did not change significantly across time and remained low, accounting for a median of 1.3% (Q1, Q3 0.3, 3.4) of total treatment cost in 1993-2002 and decreasing to a median 0.4% (Q1, Q3, 0.1, 1.0) in 2013-2017. Age 1 to 5 years at ALL diagnosis was associated with increased rehabilitation visit number and cost, and treatment in the Midwest was associated with increased likelihood of outpatient rehabilitation service utilization compared to other geographic regions. Outpatient rehabilitation services are being increasingly provided to patients with ALL at a relatively low cost per patient, yet geographic variability in care utilization is evident. These services do not add excessively to the overall cost of leukemia care and thus cost containment should not be an excuse to limit access.",0
"A precise and sensitive HPLC method, with diode array detection, for phenolic compounds in white juices and wines is presented. Eighteen of these phenolics have been identified and quantitated in white free run juices and 19 in white wines. Identification of benzoic acids was confirmed by GC/MS. The only flavonol detected, quercetin 3-glucuronide, was identified by TLC and electrospray (ESI) techniques. Levels of the trans- and cis-hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, and benzoic acids present in white juice and wine are reported. Hydroxycinnamates were the major phenols; among them, trans-caftaric, trans-coutaric, and cis-coutaric were the predominant. The cis-coutaric represented a substantial percentage in the total amount of phenols. Flavonoids were present at low concentration, and benzoic acids were the minor compounds. During white vinification, a significant decrease in the phenolic compounds present in free run juice was observed, mainly caused by the hydroxycinnamic acids.",1
"Neochlorogenic acid (3-CQA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-CQA), isolated from prune (Prunus domestica L.), were identified by NMR and MS analyses. In addition, the quantity of chlorogenic acid isomers in prune were measured by HPLC. These isomers, 3-CQA, 4-CQA, and chlorogenic acid (5-CQA), were contained in the ratio 78.7:18. 4:3.9, respectively. 4-CQA was identified and quantified in prune for the first time, and relatively high amounts of this isomer were characteristic. Antioxidative activities of the chlorogenic acid isomers, such as scavenging activity on superoxide anion radicals and inhibitory effect against oxidation of methyl linoleate, were also evaluated. Each isomer showed antioxidative activities which were almost the same.",1
"Mechanogated (MG) ion channels play a crucial role in mechano-transduction and immune cell regulation, yet their impact on blood cancers, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), remains poorly understood.

Unexpectedly, we found that GsMTx4 remarkably increased basal calcium (Ca",0
"Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon (3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.",1
"Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics and antioxidant capacity.",1
"Pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at highest risk of venous thromboembolism during the induction therapy (IT). These events are not predictable by conventional coagulation assays. To investigate the utility of global coagulation assays (GCAs) for assessing the hemostatic state in children with ALL during IT. We included children with ALL (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15). Analyses were performed at different time points during IT of the AIEOP-BFM protocols. In addition to prothrombotic biomarkers, natural anticoagulant proteins, and in vivo thrombin generation (TG) markers, ex vivo TG was measured using the gold standard calibrated automated thrombogram method, automated ST Genesia, and thrombodynamics analyzer (TD). The latter also provided measurement of fibrin clot formation. Different from conventional coagulation assays and in vivo TG markers, ex vivo GCAs detected increasing prothrombotic changes during IT. Particularly, TG measured with TD as expressed by endogenous thrombin potential was already significantly elevated at days 8 to 12 (P < .01) and continued to increase during IT compared with prior to beginning treatment, indicating a very early shift toward a procoagulant state. A similar pattern was observed for the rate of fibrin clot formation (stationary rate of clot growth: P < .01 at days 8-12). Remarkably, in patients developing thrombotic complications (n = 5), both GCAs, ST Genesia and TD, showed a significantly higher endogenous thrombin potential very early (already at days 8-12, P < .05), well before clinical manifestation. GCAs capture prothrombotic changes early during IT in ALL pediatric patients. If confirmed, this approach will allow tailoring thromboprophylaxis in children with ALL at highest risk for venous thromboembolism.",0
"Proanthocyanidins, the most abundant polyphenols in chocolate, are not depolymerized in the stomach and reach the small intestine intact, where they are hardly absorbed because of their high molecular weight. In vitro and in vivo studies using pure compounds as substrates suggest that proanthocyanidins and the related catechin monomers may be degraded into more bioavailable low-molecular-weight phenolic acids by the microflora in the colon.",1
"Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah), a CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy, has demonstrated high efficacy in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, data from regions such as the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Africa remain limited. Our center, based in Saudi Arabia, has been administering Tisagenlecleucel since March 2021. In this study, we retrospectively report on both clinical outcomes and the relationship between product characteristics, toxicity profiles, and treatment response in a real-world cohort of AYA patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from 20 patients aged 14-25 years treated with Tisagenlecleucel between March 2021 and August 2024. Baseline characteristics, response rates, relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity data were collected. In addition, CAR T-cell product parameters, including cell composition and in-process metrics, were correlated with clinical efficacy and toxicity. Toxicities assessed included cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and corticosteroid use. The median age of the cohort was 19 years. By day 28 postinfusion, 89% of patients achieved complete remission. At a median follow-up of 12 months, the 1-year RFS and OS rates were 56% and 74%, respectively. B-cell aplasia loss occurred in 35% of patients at a median of 5 months, and 35% proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation following CAR T-cell therapy. Grade III-IV CRS occurred in one patient (5%), and grade III-IV ICANS in two patients (10%). Exploratory analysis revealed associations between CAR T-cell product quality and both response and durability of remission. Additionally, steroid administration for toxicity management did not appear to compromise treatment efficacy. This is the first report from Saudi Arabia evaluating Tisagenlecleucel outcomes in AYA patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL. Our data confirm favorable response and survival rates consistent with international experience. Moreover, product quality metrics and toxicity management strategies may influence treatment durability, underscoring the need for region-specific real-world evidence to inform CAR T-cell therapy optimization.",0
"Rare acute leukemia (AL) components or subtypes such as blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) or early T-cell precursor acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ETP-ALL) can be difficult to detect by routine flow cytometry due to their immunophenotypes overlapping with other poorly differentiated AL. We hypothesized that using standardized EuroFlow™ Consortium approach could better diagnose such entities among cases that previously classified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M0, AML with minimal differentiation, AML with myelodysplasia-related changes without further lineage differentiation, and AL of ambiguous lineage. In order to confirm this hypothesis and assess whether these AL subtypes such as BPDCN and ETP-ALL had previously gone undetected, we reanalyzed 49 banked cryopreserved sample cases using standardized EuroFlow™ Consortium panels. We also performed target sequencing to capture the mutational commonalities between these AL subtypes. Reanalysis led to revised or refined diagnoses for 23 cases (47%). Of these, five diagnoses were modified, uncovering 3 ETP-ALL and 2 typical BPDCN cases. In 12 AML cases, a variable proportion of immature plasmacytoid dendritic cell and/or monocytic component was newly identified. In one AML case, we have identified a megakaryoblastic differentiation. Finally, in five acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, we were able to more precisely determine the maturation stage. The application of standardized EuroFlow flow cytometry immunophenotyping improves the diagnostic accuracy of ALs and could impact treatment decisions.",0
"Four ferulic acid dehydrodimers were isolated from rye bran and purified by preparative HPLC after alkaline hydrolysis. The identity of the compounds were confirmed by UV,1H and13C-NMR and mass spectroscopy. The content of the four identified dimers corresponded to a total dimer concentration of 307 μg/g (dry matter) of the whole grain. The concentrations in the bran fraction were 10–20 times higher than in the starchy endosperm. The four dimers were in decreasing amounts: ((Z)- β -{4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy}-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-cinnamic acid (8-O-4′-DiFA);trans -5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (8-5′-DiFA benzofuran form), (E,E)-4,4′-dihydroxy-5,5′-dimethoxy-3,3′-bicinnamic acid (5-5′-DiFA) and (E,E)-4,4′-dihydroxy-3,5′-dimethoxy-β,3′-bicinnamic acid (8-5′-DiFA). The ferulic acid dehydrodimers were also synthesised by a simple procedure from ethyl ferulate using peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide.",1
"In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null (0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = -0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR T) therapy produced excellent activity in patients with relapsed/refractory B-lineage malignancies. However, extending these therapies to T cell cancers requires overcoming unique challenges. In the recent years, multiple approaches have been developed in preclinical models and some were tested in clinical trials in patients with treatment-refractory T-cell malignanices with promising early results. Here, we review main hurdles impeding the success of CAR T therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), discuss potential solutions, and summarize recent progress in both preclinical and clinical development of CAR T therapy for these diseases.",0
"To gain better insight into the potential health effects of fruits and vegetables, reliable biomarkers of intake are needed. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of flavonoid excretion in both 24-h and morning urine samples to reflect a low intake and moderate changes in fruit and vegetable consumption. Furthermore, the urinary excretions of 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) and potassium were investigated as other potential biomarkers of fruit and vegetable intake. The study was designed as a 5-d randomized, controlled crossover study. On d 1-3, the men (n = 12) consumed a self-restricted flavonoid-free diet. On d 4, they were provided a strictly controlled diet containing no fruits or vegetables (basic diet). On d 5, they consumed the basic diet supplemented with 300 or 600 g of fruits and vegetables. The total excretion of flavonoids in 24-h urine samples increased linearly with increasing fruit and vegetable intakes (r(s) = 0.86, P < 1 x 10(-6)). The total excretion of flavonoids in morning urine also increased, but the association was weaker (r(s) = 0.59, P < 0.0001). Urinary 4-PA in 24-h and morning urine samples increased significantly only with the 600-g increase in fruit and vegetable intake, whereas the excretion of potassium in urine did not reflect the changes in fruit and vegetable intake. We conclude that the total excretion of flavonoids in 24-h urine may be used as a new biomarker for fruit and vegetable intake.",1
"Authentic samples of oranges, frozen concentrated orange juice and pulp-wash, and retail samples of freshly squeezed orange juice and frozen concentrated orange juice have been collected in Brazil and analysed for the flavanone glycosides (FG) narirutin and hesperidin by reversed phase HPLC with UV detection at 280nm. The juice from hand-squeezed fruit gave narirutin and hesperidin concentrations of 16–142mgl−1 and 104–537mgl−1, respectively. The ratio of hesperidin to narirutin showed varietal difference with Pera having the highest ratio (mean 8.4) and Baı́a the lowest (3.6). Frozen concentrated orange juice contained higher quantities of FG with narirutin ranging from 62 to 84mgl−1 and hesperidin from 531 to 690mgl−1 (after dilution to 12°Brix). In frozen concentrated orange juice pulp-wash, the narirutin level ranged from 155 to 239mgl−1 and hesperidin from 1089 to 1200mgl−1. The analysis of 23 samples of freshly squeezed juice from the Brazilian market place showed that the FG content of most samples (9.1 to 94.8 and 105.8 to 586.6mgl−1, respectively, for narirutin and hesperidin) was similar to those found for authentic ones, indicating that these orange juices were not adulterated.",1
"A method has been developed for the analysis of phytoestrogens and their conjugates in human urine using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Stable isotopically labeled [13C(3)]daidzein and [13C(3)]genistein were synthesized and used as internal standards for isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Free aglycons and intact glucuronide, sulfate, diglucuronide, disulfate, and mixed sulfoglucuronide conjugates of isoflavones and lignans were observed in naturally incurred urine samples. Sample pretreatment was not necessary, other than addition of internal standards and pH adjustment. Urine was injected directly onto the analytical column. The limits of detection were generally <50ng/ml, precision was generally <10% CV for conjugates. Total hydrolyzed daidzein and genistein were measured against quality assurance urine sample and were accurate to within 12%. The accuracy of conjugate measurement can not be ascertained, as no reference samples are available. The mean sum of daidzein and its conjugates was within 20% of the hydrolyzed value. Concentrations of the free aglycons of up to 22% of genistein and 18% of daidzein were observed. The average pattern was ca. 54% 7-glucuronide, 25% 4(')-glucuronide, 13% monosulfates, 7% free daidzein, 0.9% sulfoglucuronides, 0.4% diglucuronide, and <0.1% disulfate. Selective enzymatic deconjugation with glucuronidase and mixed glucuronidase/sulfatase were used to validate the accuracy of the quantitation of the intact daidzein conjugates. There were no apparent sex differences, or conditioning effects on the conjugation profile of isoflavones after chronic dosing.",1
"A head and neck cancer (HNC) diagnosis significantly impacts a patient's quality of life (QOL). Palliative care potentially improves their QOL. We will conduct a scoping review to identify existing knowledge about palliative care interventions for patients with HNC. This scoping review was designed in accordance with the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis: Scoping Reviews and will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. Our eligibility criteria follow the Population, Intervention, Comparison or Control, Outcomes and Study characteristics framework. The population is adult patients with locally advanced, metastatic, unresectable and/or recurrent HNC. We include peer-reviewed journal articles and articles in the press, in English, reporting on palliative care interventions with at least two of the eight National Consensus Project on Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care domains; studies with and without comparators will be included. The outcomes are patient QOL (primary) and symptom severity, patients' satisfaction with care, patients' mood, advance care planning and place of death (secondary). We developed a search strategy across ten databases, to be searched from the inception to 11 September 2023: Medline ALL (Medline and EPub Ahead of Print and In-Process, In-Data-Review & Other Non-Indexed Citations), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase Classic+Embase, Emcare and PsycINFO all from the OvidSP platform; CINAHL from EBSCOhost, Scopus from Elsevier, Web of Science from Clarivate and Global Index Medicus from WHO. We will extract data using a piloted data form and analyse the data through descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Ethics approval is not needed for a scoping review. We will disseminate the findings to healthcare providers and policy-makers by publishing the results in a scientific journal.",0
"Three espresso coffee (EC) samples of different botanical varieties and types of roast were prepared in standard conditions using an experimental EC prototype: Arabica coffee, Robusta Natural blend, and Robusta Torrefacto blend (a special roast by adding sugar). The ECs were characterized with regard to the physical parameters, amount of total solids, total solids on filtrate, lipids, caffeine, trigonelline, and chlorogenic acids by HPLC, and sensory descriptive analysis related to foam appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate the EC samples. Arabica and Robusta samples were separated successfully by principal component 1 (55.3% of variance) including physicochemical and sensory parameters related to foam and taste of ECs. Torrefacto and Robusta Natural EC samples were separated by principal component 2 (20.7% of total variance) including mouthfeel and other attributes of color foam. Some interesting correlations among sensory and physicochemical variables were found. A very simple discriminate function was obtained by discriminate analysis allowing the classification of each EC sample into its respective group with a success rate of 100%.",1
"The objective of this work was to quantify the flavonoids present in foods most commonly consumed by the Brazilian population. The predominant flavonoids found in largest abundance in all of the analyzed vegetables were glycosides of quercetin. In lettuce, a small amount of luteolin was also detected. In sweet pepper, quercetin and luteolin were both present. White onion [48-56 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW), expressed as aglycon], red onion (40-100 mg/100 g of FW), red lettuce (67-67.2 mg/100 g of FW), arugula (41-118 mg/100 g of FW), and chicory (18-38 mg/100 g of FW) were highest in total flavonoids. In fruits, the highest concentrations of flavonoids were found in the peel (125-170 mg/100 g of FW) and pulp (35-44 mg/100 g of FW) of oranges and in some apple varieties (14-36 mg/100 g of FW). Variability in flavonoid content due to time of harvesting was high for leafy vegetables and red onions. The estimated ingestion by Brazilian population ranged from 60 to 106 mg/day.",1
"In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), neutropenia and fever of unknown origin may occur, indicating the use of antimicrobials to control a probable infection. However, in 60-70% of cases there is no obvious infectious focus so treatment is empirical, increasing the risk of developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The construction of a prognostic model of fever and development of SIRS based on the identification of endogenous molecules, called alarmins or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory cytokines, can help identify children with ALL and fever or SIRS and who do not have an infection. A cohort of 30 children with recently diagnosed ALL and absence of infectious microorganisms before starting the remission induction phase was studied. Two groups were identified: (1) a group with SIRS (fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukopenia, without focus of infection) and (2) a group without SIRS. The DAMPs, namely HMGB1 and S100A8 proteins, were quantified by ELISA and inflammatory mediators were determined by multiple protein analysis. The medians of DAMPs and inflammatory mediators in children with SIRS were higher than in children who did not have SIRS, and the delta values of the biomarkers studied in patients with and without SIRS showed important differences, with statistically higher medians in patients with SIRS compared to those without SIRS. HMGB1 together with IL-1β, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP-1 can serve as biomarkers to identify children with ALL and fever or SIRS who should not receive antimicrobial treatment because the origin of their fever is not due to an infectious agent.",0
"In this study, curly kale stored at 1°C for 3 and 6 weeks was compared with plants remaining in the field regarding several properties related to human health and sensory quality. Cold storage had no effect on the antioxidant capacity (ORAC assay), total phenols (Folin-Ciocalteu assay) or flavonol content, but reduced the content of vitamin C and soluble sugars. The ratio ascorbic:dehydroascorbic acid decreased from about 3 to 0.5 upon storage. The largest changes in the content of bioactive compounds were found in plants that remained in the field for 6 additional weeks, including many frost days. In these plants, the levels of flavonols, total phenols and antioxidant capacity were reduced by 25–35% and the vitamin C content by more than 50%, whereas soluble sugars and dry matter increased by roughly 20% and 30%, respectively. Among all the curly kale samples, the antioxidant capacity was positively correlated with the level of total phenols (r=0.73, P<0.001) and total flavonols (r=0.70, P<0.001). Values obtained with a non-destructive method based on chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) were well correlated with the flavonol content in the leaves, with the highest correlation found for quercetin (r=0.76, P<0.001). Using the ChlF method, the kinetics of the flavonol content during the experiment was recorded. The same method also showed gradients of flavonol content within the plant, with the highest values in the upper leaves and in the tip of the leaves. ChlF measurement, therefore, proved to be a quick and cost-effective alternative to chemical analyses of the flavonol content in curly kale.",1
"Immune system and bone marrow stromal cells play an important role in maintaining normal hematopoiesis. Lymphoid neoplasia disturbs not only development of immune cells, but other immune response mechanisms as well. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) of the bone marrow are involved in immune response regulation through both intercellular interactions and secretion of various cytokines. In hematological malignancies, the bone marrow stromal microenvironment, including MSCs, is altered. Aim of this study was to describe the differences of MSCs' immunological function in the patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In ALL, malignant cells arise from the early precursor cells localized in bone marrow, while in DLBCL they arise from more differentiated B-cells. In this study, only the DLBCL patients without bone marrow involvement were included. Growth parameters, surface marker expression, genes of interest expression, and secretion pattern of bone marrow MSCs from the patients with ALL and DLBCL at the onset of the disease and in remission were studied. MSCs from the healthy donors of corresponding ages were used as controls. It has been shown that concentration of MSCs in the bone marrow of the patients with ALL is reduced at the onset of the disease and is restored upon reaching remission; in the patients with DLBCL this parameter does not change. Proliferative capacity of MSCs did not change in the patients with ALL; however, the cells of the DLBCL patients both at the onset and in remission proliferated significantly faster than those from the donors. Expression of the membrane surface markers and expression of the genes important for differentiation, immunological status maintenance, and cytokine secretion differed significantly in the MSCs of the patients from those of the healthy donors and depended on nosology of the disease. Secretomes of the MSCs varied greatly; a number of proteins associated with immune response regulation, differentiation, and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells were depleted in the secretomes of the cells from the patients. Lymphoid neoplasia leads to dramatic changes in the functional immunological status of MSCs.",0
"Phenolic compounds represent a unique and functional part of the polar fraction of virgin olive oils. Many different approaches for the analysis of these compounds have been published, which has led to ambiguous results that are difficult to compare. In order to explain the controversial data reported in the literature, extraction techniques (solid-phase extraction, SPE, and liquid-liquid extraction, LLE), methods of analysis (HPLC and colorimetric assay) and quantification methods have been re-investigated with genuine olive oil phenols. The optimized LLE system led to high recovery of the nine major olive oil phenolics (93%) and, in addition, was at least as good as the SPE technique in view of costs, solvent and sample consumption, and analysis time. SPE was shown to be problematic because of the selectivity towards the individual phenolics, particularly the aglycone-type ones. The proposed LLE/HPLC method was compared with the traditional colorimetric assay (Folin-Ciocalteu method) by analyzing 23 samples of virgin olive oils. A strong correlation between both methods has been found, suggesting that the colorimetric assay is reasonably valid for a rough prediction of the total phenolic content. In the literature, the level of phenolics is expressed in several different units (reference compound equivalents in case of colorimetric measurements and ppm in HPLC measurements). As these units can differ in orders of magnitude, it is necessary to convert the data to a common base before comparing or combining them.",1
"Five different genotypes (Tesoro, Marko, Clip, Vyp-70 and Nanta) of sunflower seeds were studied and the phenolic compositions of their kernel and hull were characterised by HPLC and MS techniques. The main phenolic compounds present in both the kernel and hull are chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and two caffeoylquinic derivatives. Both derivatives were characterised by partial alkaline hydrolysis and LC/MS. The four phenolic compounds present in the kernel ranged from 94.6% (genotype Clip) to 99.3% (genotype Marko) of the total phenolic compounds of the whole seed. Therefore the dehulling of the seed scarcely improves its nutritional value.",1
"Cocoa and chocolate products from major brands were analyzed blind for total antioxidant capacity (AOC) (lipophilic and hydrophilic ORAC(FL)), catechins, and procyanidins (monomer through polymers). Accuracy of analyses was ascertained by comparing analyses on a NIST standard reference chocolate with NIST certified values. Procyanidin (PC) content was related to the nonfat cocoa solid (NFCS) content. The natural cocoa powders (average 87% of NFCS) contained the highest levels of AOC (826 +/- 103 micromol of TE/g) and PCs (40.8 +/- 8.3 mg/g). Alkalized cocoa (Dutched powders, average 80% NFCS) contained lower AOC (402 +/- 6 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (8.9 +/- 2.7 mg/g). Unsweetened chocolates or chocolate liquor (50% NFCS) contained 496 +/- 40 micromol of TE /g of AOC and 22.3 +/- 2.9 mg/g of PCs. Milk chocolates, which contain the least amount of NFCS (7.1%), had the lowest concentrations of AOC (80 +/- 10 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (2.7 +/- 0.5 mg/g). One serving of cocoa (5 g) or chocolate (15 or 40 g, depending upon the type of chocolate) provides 2000-9100 micromol of TE of AOC and 45-517 mg of PCs, amounts that exceed the amount in a serving of the majority of foods consumed in America. The monomers through trimers, which are thought to be directly bioavailable, contributed 30% of the total PCs in chocolates. Hydrophilic antioxidant capacity contributed >90% of AOC in all products. The correlation coefficient between AOC and PCs in chocolates was 0.92, suggesting that PCs are the dominant antioxidants in cocoa and chocolates. These results indicate that NFCS is correlated with AOC and PC in cocoa and chocolate products. Alkalizing dramatically decreased both the procyanidin content and antioxidant capacity, although not to the same extent.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a complex malignancy, displays varying expression profiles of PIP4K2-related genes in adult patients. While PIP4K2A expression is elevated in ALL bone marrow cells compared to healthy bone marrow cells, PIP4K2B is downregulated, and PIP4K2C remains relatively unchanged. Despite the correlation between increased PIP4K2A expression and increased percentage of peripheral blood blasts, clinical outcomes do not strongly correlate with the expression of these genes. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of three PIP4K2 inhibitors (THZ-P1-2, a131, and CC260) in ALL cell models. THZ-P1-2 emerges as the most effective inhibitor, inducing cell death and mitochondrial damage while reducing cell viability and metabolism significantly. Comparative analyses highlight the superior efficacy of THZ-P1-2 over a131 and CC260. Notably, THZ-P1-2 uniquely disrupts autophagic flux and inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, indicating a distinct molecular mechanism. In summary, our findings elucidate the differential expression of PIP4K2-related genes in ALL and underscore the potential role of PIP4K2A in disease pathogenesis. The therapeutic promise of THZ-P1-2 in ALL treatment, along with its distinct effects on cell death mechanisms and signaling pathways, enriches our understanding of PIP4K2's involvement in ALL development and offers targeted therapy prospects.",0
"The year 2017 was marked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first two chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) therapies. The approved indications were for the treatment of relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in a second or later relapse. Since then, extensive research activities have been ongoing globally on different hematologic and solid tumors to assess the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy for these diseases. Limitations to CAR-T therapy became apparent from, e.g., the relapse in up to 60% of patients and certain side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). This led to extensive clinical activities aimed at overcoming these obstacles, so that the use of CAR-T therapy can be expanded. Attempts to improve on efficacy and safety include changing the CAR-T administration schedule, combining it with chemotherapy, and the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies, e.g., through the use of CAR-natural killer (CAR-NK) and CAR macrophages (CAR-Ms). This review will focus on new CAR-T treatment strategies in hematologic malignancies, clinical trials aimed at improving efficacy and addressing side effects, the challenges that CAR-T therapy faces in solid tumors, and the ongoing research aimed at overcoming these challenges.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) is a high-risk malignancy with poor outcomes due to frequent relapse. The prognostic role of minimal residual disease (MRD) dynamic monitoring in adult T-ALL/LBL needs further validation across chemotherapy and transplantation phases. This large-scale study aimed to assess multi-timepoint MRD as a predictive biomarker, and integrated risk factors in adult T-ALL/LBL. 348 T-ALL/LBL patients treated with induction/consolidation chemotherapy ± allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) were involved. MRD was assessed via multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) at four landmark timepoints: post-induction (EOI-MRD), post-consolidation (EOC-MRD), pre-HSCT (pre-MRD), and post-HSCT (post-MRD). The prognostic value of routine clinical and laboratory variables was analyzed. The cohort exhibited 10-year OS and EFS rates of 35.0% and 28.2%, respectively. Adverse prognostic factors included thrombocytopenia (PLT ≤ 90 × 10⁹/L; p = 0.0195), elevated LDH (> 600 IU/L; p = 0.0338), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infiltration (p = 0.0012), and induction failure (p = 0.0237). HSCT improved outcomes (median OS: 24 vs. 17 months; p = 0.0007), especially in relapsed/refractory (R/R) patients (5-year OS: 40% vs. < 20%; p = 0.0042). MRD positivity predicted inferior survival at all timepoints (EOI-MRD: p = 0.0255; pre-HSCT: p = 0.0156; post-HSCT: p < 0.0001, 100% relapse if positive). Chemotherapy-only patients with sustained MRD negativity had a reduced relapse rate (p = 0.0090) and superior OS (p = 0.0001). In conclusion, dynamic MRD monitoring (pre-/post-HSCT and during chemotherapy) is prognostic in adult T-ALL/LBL. Combined with variables including LDH and MRD kinetics enables precision prognostication and guides therapeutic decision-making, including early HSCT for persistent MRD-positive cases.",0
"Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is an adverse event associated with T-cell engaging (TCE) immuno-oncology therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T), bispecific TCE antibodies and dual-affinity retargeting proteins. To develop a model to predict the preinfusion risk of CRS grade ≥2 for patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with TCE bispecific antibodies. A TCE dataset including clinical trials from 2014 to 2019 evaluating non-CAR-T TCE therapies was sourced from the Medidata Enterprise Data Store, an anonymized data repository from completed clinical trials. The outcome of interest was the first CRS grade ≥2 occurring within 10 days of TCE therapy. Risk factors for CRS grade ≥2 were identified from the literature and preliminary data analysis. Features were measured prior to or at the first TCE treatment. Patients were included in the analysis dataset if they had a data element fill rate of >70% for the key features. Features were pruned by assessing multicollinearity across features. Logistic regression and tree-based models were trained. Across 100 iterations with different train-test splits, the average area under the receiver-operator characteristic (AUROC) curve was calculated for each model type. A total of 715 patients (115 CRS grade ≥2 and 600 CRS grade <2) were included in the analysis; most patients had ALL (81%) and 19% had solid tumors or NHL. Patients who developed CRS grade ≥2 had a higher incidence of prior infections (38% versus 28%; P = 0.03) and a higher first dose of TCE therapy (P < 0.001). The best model to predict CRS grade ≥2 had a mean AUROC of 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.72) on the test set. When patients were ranked based on their predicted probability of getting CRS grade ≥2 and divided into quartiles based on predicted CRS grade ≥2 risk (very low, low, high, very high), the very high-risk quartile developed CRS grade ≥2 at 5.9 times the rate (38.10% [interquartile range: 33.33-43.54]) compared to the very-low risk quartile (6.45% [3.44-8.82]; the sample average was 12.96% [9.25-24.07]). Compared to patients with very low CRS grade ≥2 risk, patients with very high CRS grade ≥2 risk had ALL as a disease type (99% versus 67%, P < 0.001), received a higher TCE dose (1.00 versus 0.61, P < 0.001), had a higher rate of prior infections (49% versus 12%, P < 0.001) and a higher serum creatinine (0.60 versus 0.32, P < 0.001). Using the CRS grade ≥2 risk model, it was possible to stratify patients by risk categories. CRS grade ≥2 risk stratification may facilitate patient selection for TCE therapy and tailored pretreatment and monitoring of CRS to maximize treatment efficacy and safety.",0
"In Western countries food products containing soybean proteins are primarily directed to some specific classes of consumers, in particular vegetarians, milk-intolerant or gluten-intolerant subjects, and hypercholesterolemic patients. The consumption of these products is associated with the presence of isoflavones, which recently have become a very controversial issue because their beneficial properties are counterbalanced by some undesirable effects. Taking into account that information on the average isoflavone daily intake in European countries and especially in Italy is very scarce, we decided to quantify the isoflavones in some products for different classes of consumers, with the objective of evaluating their possible exposition. The total isoflavone contents were in the range 21–803 μg/gd.w. and were particularly high in imitation dairy and meat products. Infant formulas contained 121–427 μg/gd.w., whereas the isoflavone contents in gluten-free products were in the range 77–220 μg/gd.w.. Only in the case of infants and children, the daily intake may overcome the recommended limit introduced by the Italian Health Authority for isoflavone supplements.",1
"Potato enjoys a unique distinction among many root and tuber crops used as human food. It is considered as one of the major food crops, other being cereals. Potato is used for different purposes indifferent countries and about one half of the world production being used as human food In developing countries like India people are traditionally dependent upon cereals and are generally unaware of the nutritive value of potatoes. It is, therefore, very important to obtain an idea of the nutritional composition of potato for correct appreciation of its nutritive value.",1
"Asparaginase (ASN) is a critical component of pediatric ALL protocols. Until recently, ASN was available in three formulations: native Escherichia coli, PEGylated E. coli (PEG), and Erwinase, with native E. coli typically more accessible in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Short shelf lives, intermittent availability, and concern for substandard formulations in LMICs have created a need for proactive ASN demand estimates. We adapted FORxECAST, a pediatric cancer drug forecasting model, to focus on ASN for pediatric ALL. The model is adaptable to user data and defaults to best available public data where local data are unavailable. We forecast ASN quantity and cost in three case study countries for four scenarios using two regimens-base regimen (BR) and intensified regimen (IR)-outlining how quantity and costs vary on the basis of ASN formulation, dose, and second-line availability. Native E. coli is cheaper than PEG for first-line treatment across all scenarios. Regimen intensification from BR to IR requires a substantially higher cost when PEG is used relative to native E. coli. The cost of treating ASN hypersensitivity with Erwinase for BR in Burundi, Ghana, and Turkmenistan is $19,660 in US dollars (USD), $24,800 USD, and $15,246 USD, respectively. Treatment intensification requires a cost increase that should be accessible for most LMICs, but PEG utilization is substantially more costly, suggesting that prioritizing investment in intensifying treatment using native E. coli is the least costly approach to maximize treatment availability. Cost savings associated with native E. coli utilization may liberate funds for Erwinase procurement for patients with ASN hypersensitivity. Future analyses needed include an evaluation of costs associated with preventing abandonment due to compliance complexity with native E. coli given increased administration frequency compared with PEG.",0
"In the randomized cohort of the international phase-III FORUM trial, which showed the superiority of total-body irradiation (TBI) over chemotherapy-based conditioning prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), type of conditioning and remission phase, but not pre-HSCT minimal residual disease (MRD), were associated with outcome. We report the impact of MRD within the extended FORUM cohort. Patients (n=1014), 4-21 years old, transplanted from a matched donor who had ≥1 MRD measurement prior to and/or 100 days and/or 1 year after HSCT were eligible. A threshold of 0.01% defined MRD positivity versus negativity. Prior to HSCT, 21% of patients were MRDpos. Three-year event-free survival (EFS) was 0.73 and 0.59 (p<0.001), and 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was 0.20 and 0.33 (p<0.001) in MRDneg and MRDpos patients, respectively. The level of MRD positivity pre-HSCT (<0.1% versus ≥0.1%), did not significantly affect outcome. Pre-HSCT MRDneg and TBI/etoposide conditioning were associated with a 2-fold lower risk of relapse, whereas MRDpos had a 2-fold higher risk of any failure and/or death. No detrimental effect of MRDpos pre-HSCT could be demonstrated in patients with T-cell ALL. MRDpos versus MRDneg patients at day 100 had an EFS of 0.47 versus 0.77 (p<0.001) and a CIR of 0.51 versus 0.17 (p<0.001), respectively, but post-HSCT MRDpos did not necessarily imply relapse. In conclusion, the MRD status pre-HSCT and at day 100 post-HSCT was a strong prognostic factor for children transplanted for ALL in the extended FORUM cohort.",0
"The rutin content of buckwheat products was compared to the rutin content in their raw materials, in order to evaluate their value for producing functional foods. There is much less rutin in noodles (78mg/kg, d.w.b. – dry weight basis), than in the dark buckwheat flour (218mg/kg, d.w.b.) from which they are produced. One of the possible explanations is the presence of the rutin degrading enzyme. In raw (uncooked) groats there is 230mg/kg (d.w.b.) of rutin and in precooked groats, 88mg/kg (d.w.b.). In buckwheat beer and vinegar there is a negligible content of rutin. Buckwheat leaf flour contains about 2700mg/kg (d.w.b.) rutin, and is thus a suitable material for enriching functional foods, giving it the potential for preventive nutrition.",1
"(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant tea catechin, has been proposed to be beneficial to human health based on its strong antioxidative and other biological activities in vitro. Inadequate knowledge regarding the bioavailability and biotransformation of EGCG in humans, however, has limited our understanding of its possible beneficial health effects. In this study, 4',4' '-di-O-methyl-EGCG (4',4' '-DiMeEGCG) was detected in human plasma and urine by LC/MS/MS following green tea ingestion. Both 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG reached peak plasma values (20.5 +/- 7.7 and 145.4 +/- 31.6 nM, respectively, in 4 subjects) at 2 h after the dose. The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. (-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another possible ring-fission metabolite, (-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.",1
"The effect of high-intensity pulsed electric fields (HIPEF) processing (35 kV/cm for 1,700 μs in bipolar 4-μs pulses at 100 Hz) on individual phenolic compounds (phenolic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C and antioxidant capacity of strawberry juice was evaluated and compared to heat (90 °C for 60 or 30 s) and fresh juice as a reference. Although strawberry juice underwent a substantial depletion of health-related compounds with storage time irrespective of the treatment conducted, ellagic acid was enhanced. HIPEF-treated strawberry juice maintained higher amounts of phenolic acids (ellagic and p-coumaric acid) and total anthocyanins than the thermally treated juices during the storage period. Regarding the antioxidant capacity, similar DPPH and ABTS values were obtained so that differences among pasteurized juices were non significant. HIPEF processing may be a technology as effective as thermal treatments not only to achieve safe and stable juices, but also to obtain juices with a high content of antioxidant compounds.",1
"Polygonum cuspidatum extract as a traditional Chinese medicine is extracted from the dried rhizome and root of Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc. Resveratrol is one of its active components. Studies were performed in rats to define the tissue distribution and excretion of resveratrol in urine and bile, and to characterize (if possible) any metabolites of resveratrol observed in tissues after ig 20mg/kg Polygonum cuspidatum extract.",1
"Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disease due to genetic variants in the GLA gene located on the X chromosome. Males are hemizygous, while many females are genetic mosaics due to the random inactivation of the X chromosome. While most of the identified variants are deleterious for GLA, in some cases, less rare gene variants have been considered responsible for some FD features. GLA variants were selected from the database of 469 thousand genotyped subjects of the UK Biobank database. Pathogenic variants (ALL_P), variants of uncertain significance (ALL_U), and variants with conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity (ALL_C) were grouped, while p.Asp313Tyr, p.Ala143Thr, p.Ser126Gly, p.Arg118Cys, and p.Asn215Ser were evaluated individually. More than 480 thousand subjects not carrying variants in the GLA gene were used as controls in association studies. Clinical and biochemical phenotypes were extracted from the same database, and a FD phenotype score (FASTEX derived Fabry, FDF score) was derived from the FASTEX prognostic to assess the probability of an FD phenotype score. Pathogenic variants and p.Asn215Ser were associated with FDF score, while all other variants were not associated with any FDF feature. Stratification of patients based on a calculated cardiovascular (CV) risk score demonstrated that patients with nonpathogenic variants within the highest CV risk quartile (> 75th percentile) showed characteristic features of FD, whereas those in the lower risk group (< 75th percentile) showed odds ratios indicating inverse association with FD features. In conclusion, the data from UK Biobank suggest that pathogenic variants are always associated with FD features, while variants of uncertain significance and conflicting interpretation acquire an FD phenotype only in the presence of a high CV risk burden.",0
"Ellagic acid is a phenolic compound which occurs naturally in strawberries. Interest in ellagic acid has increased during the past few years owing to its properties as a micronutrient. The objective of this study was to determine the ellagic acid content in strawberries compared with that in other common fruits and to evaluate its variability, the effects of ripening stage, and the tissue and seasonal variability in selected cultivars widely grown in Argentina. Strawberries showed significantly higher levels of ellagic acid than many other fruits of economic importance, ranging from 0.16 to 2.07 mg g−1 dry weight. The ellagic acid content was highest in green fruit, intermediate in mid-ripe fruit and lowest in full-ripe fruit. Cultivars ‘Chandler’ and ‘Camarosa’ contained the highest amounts of ellagic acid in strawberries with edible value (0.78 and 0.70 mg g−1 dry weight respectively), while ‘Oso Grande’ and ‘Milsei’ exhibited the lowest (0.35 and 0.31 mg g−1 dry weight respectively). Moreover, the level of this phytochemical was found to be higher when considering pulp with achenes compared with pulp without achenes.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) tends to involve central nervous system (CNS) infiltration at diagnosis. However, cases of residual CNS lesions detected at the end of induction and post early intensification have not been recorded in patients with T-ALL. Also, the ratio and prognosis of patients with residual intracranial lesions have not been defined. A 9-year-old boy with T-ALL had multiple intracranial tumors, which were still detected post early intensification. To investigate residual CNS lesions, we used In cases with residual lesions on imaging studies, treatment strategies should be considered by the systemic response, direct assessment of spinal fluid, along with further development of noninvasive imaging methods in CNS. Further retrospective or prospective studies are required to determine the prognosis and frequency of cases with residual intracranial lesions after induction therapy.",0
"Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, identified in urine are presented.",1
"Recurrent genetic lesions provide basis for risk assessment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, current prognostic classifiers rely on a limited number of predefined sets of alterations. Disease-relevant copy number aberrations (CNAs) were screened genome-wide in 260 children with B-cell precursor ALL. Results were integrated with cytogenetic data to improve risk assessment. CNAs were detected in 93.8% (n = 244) of the patients. First, cytogenetic profiles were combined with IKZF1 status (IKZF1 PersonALL, our conceptually novel prognostic classifier considers all combinations of co-segregating genetic alterations, providing a highly personalized patient stratification.",0
"The study describes an improved version of the reverse-phase-HPLC method. To determine free resveratrol isomers, the method uses isocratic elution and electrochemical detection with the use of a glassy working electrode at a potential of 0.75 V. The effects of important factors – such as the isomerization of standard resveratrol solution in diffused daylight and its dependence on temperature or resveratrol isomerization in wine samples – were investigated. The equilibrium between trans- and cis-isomer was achieved after a 5-h exposure to the daily diffused light and it was not significantly influenced by the temperature (30–60 °C). Linearity was obtained in the concentration range from 0.01 to 10 mgl−1. The detection limit (S/N=3) was 3 μgl−1 for trans-resveratrol and 15 μgl−1 for cis-resveratrol. The trans- and cis-resveratrol were determined in selected Czech red and white wines and in the extract from Vitis vinifera plant. The concentration of trans-resveratrol ranged from 0.7 to 11 mgl−1, that of cis-resveratrol from 0.6 to 5.1 mgl−1.",1
"Tomato juice containing rutin (quercetin-3-rutinoside) was ingested by healthy volunteers and ileostomists. Blood and urine collected over 24 h were analysed by HPLC with photodiode array (PDA) and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Low concentrations of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide (Cmax = 4.3 +/- 1.5 nmoles/l) and quercetin-3-glucuronide (Cmax = 12 +/- 2 nmoles/l) were detected in plasma of healthy subjects. Metabolites appeared in blood after 4 h indicating absorption from the large intestine. Nine metabolites of rutin were detected in urine but with considerable variation in total amount (40 +/- 1-4981 +/- 115 nmoles over 24 h). No metabolites were detected in plasma or urine of ileostomists and 86 +/- 3% of the ingested rutin was recovered in ileal fluid. In subjects with an intact large intestine, but not ileostomists, rutin was catabolised with the appearance of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in urine accounting for 22% of rutin intake.",1
"The flavonoid composition of six varieties in either case of yellow and green French beans was investigated. Fresh beans were chopped under liquid nitrogen just after harvest and lyophilized subsequently. The flavonoids were exhaustively extracted, purified by selective adsorption to and stepwise elution from polyamide, and separated by RP-HPLC with UV detection. With one exception the qualitative chromatographic pattern of the 12 varieties was very similar. The main flavonoids were identified as 3-O-glucuronides (-3-O-glucur) and 3-O-rutinosides (-3-O-rut) of quercetin (Q) and kaempferol (K) by LC-TSP-MS comparing retention time, UV spectra, and mass spectra with those of pure flavonoids. The areas of HPLC peaks with identical aglycon were summed up and converted into the -3-O-rut of Q or K with the respective calibration curves. The total content of Q-3-O-glycosides ranged from 19.1 to 183.5 μg/g and that of K-3-O-glycosides from 5.6 to 14.8 μg/g of fresh bean, demonstrating a dependence on the variety without general difference between yellow and green representatives.",1
"The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation observed would delay and/or complicate this process.",1
"Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a hereditary tumor syndrome characterized by an elevated risk of malignancy, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which can be caused by the heterozygous germline mutation. TP53 gene germline mutation is considered a potential risk factor and crucial prognostic parameter for acute leukemia development and diagnosis, but rarely occurs in adults, and its specific pathogenic significance in acute leukemia is unclear. We describes a case of a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with ALL. Whole-exome sequencing approach identified one of the TP53 germline mutations from her bone marrow sample with possible pathogenic significance, c.848G>A (p.Arg283His) heterozygous missense mutation located on exon 8, which was further verified in her hair, oral mucous and nail samples. Family pedigree screening revealed that the same TP53 genetic variant was present in the patient's father and non-donor son, whereas not in the donor. Digital PCR observed that this point mutation frequency dropped post-transplantation but remained low during maintenance therapy when the patient was leukemia-free. This suspected Li-Fraumeni syndrome case report with a likely pathogenic heterozygous TP53 variant expands the cancer genetic spectrum. Screening her family members for mutations facilitates identifying the optimal relative donor and avoids unnecessary treatment by monitoring TP53 germline mutations for minimal residual disease following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Its potential roles in hematological malignant tumor development and clinical pathogenic implications necessitate further probing.",0
"Multiple myeloma (MM) is exceedingly rare in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) < 45 years of age. Real-world data from ASCO's CancerLinQ Discovery A total of 1946 AYA MM patients from SEER and 1334 from CancerLinQ were included. In terms of SPMs, AYAs were more likely to develop ALL (RR 2.6, P = .003) and AML (RR 1.7, P = .034), and less likely to develop nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR 0.2, P = .001) and prostate cancer (RR 0.1, P = .013) than MM patients ≥ 45. AYAs were at lower risk of VTE (RR 0.75, P = .002) and slightly higher risk of infections (RR 1.11, P = .002). Median OS among AYA MM patients was significantly longer than MM patients ≥ 45 in both datasets. In the SEER cohort, female sex (HR 0.74, P = .003), non-Hispanic ethnicity (HR 0.73, P = .005), and annual household income ≥ $65,000 per year (HR 0.67, P = .001) were associated with lower hazards of mortality. In the CLQD cohort, OS was significantly influenced by female sex (HR 0.6, P = .048). Race did not have a statistically significant impact OS in either cohort. Most AYAs died of MM (68.3%), other primary malignancy (7.5%, mostly leukemia), and cardiovascular events (5.2%). Infections accounted for 3.2% of deaths. This analysis highlights some unique characteristics of AYA MM patients in the United States in the modern era.",0
"The aim of the present investigation was to determine the level of vitamin C, carotenoids, beta-carotene, chlorophylls and polyphenols in dill plants 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60cm in height. Analyses included the leaf blades, petioles, whole leaves (leaf blades with petioles), stems and whole plants (whole leaf with the stem). In all parts of dill plants, with the exception of petioles, the content of vitamin C decreased with plant growth. The content of carotenoids and beta-carotene tended to increase with growth, with the exception of stems and whole plants. The proportion of beta-carotene in the content of carotenoids varied within the range of 9–17%, the highest being noted in leaf blades. The taller the plants, the higher the level of chlorophylls and polyphenols in the analysed parts of dill, except in whole plants and—in the case of polyphenols—also in stems. The taller the plants, the lower the ratio of chlorophyll a to b. Of all the constituents analysed, the highest content was found in the leaf blade and the lowest in the stem and the petiole.",1
Paediatric regimens which incorporate asparaginase have improved outcomes of adolescents and younger adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia but are limited by toxicity. This retrospective report by Tinajero and Xu suggests that delaying the timing of asparaginase administration during ALL induction may reduce risk of hepatotoxicity. Commentary on: Tinajero et al. Delaying pegaspargase during induction in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is associated with lower risk of high-grade hepatotoxicity without adversely impacting outcomes.

"The identification of 3- (3-CQL) and 4-caffeoylquinic acid-γ-lactone (4-CQL) in roasted coffee is described. The lactones were separated from chlorogenic acids (CQA) by an isocratic reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC system and identified as caffeic acid derivatives using their ultraviolet spectra obtained on the fly with an diode array detector. Thermospray liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry spectra (discharge ionisation, buffer ionisation) showed the quasi molecule ion and characteristic fragments (e.g. caffeic acid, quinide). The lactones were isolated from coffee by polyamide column chromatography followed by RP-HPLC on a semipreparative scale, and structures assigned using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and various nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. There seems to be an equilibrium between the two lactones: isolation of 3-CQL and 4-CQL under the experimental conditions used yielded both lactones in the final product. The content of the caffeoylquinides in commercial coffee samples ranged from 1.5 to 3.5 g/kg dry matter.",1
"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) poses significant treatment challenges, particularly in relapsed or refractory cases. This review synthesizes recent studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy, specifically tisagenlecleucel, in achieving complete remission (CR) and improving overall survival rates among pediatric patients with ALL. A comprehensive literature search identified 12 studies published between January 2014 and July 2024, encompassing cohort studies and clinical trials. Findings indicate that CAR-T cell therapy demonstrates superior CR rates (up to 100% in some studies) and manageable safety profiles, with common adverse effects, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. This review points out some of the important aspects such as the identification of biomarkers for response prediction, understanding of the mechanisms of resistance, and the crucial requirement for long-term outcome data. Challenges remain in the management of adverse effects, particularly CRS and neurotoxicity. This review underscores the transformative potential of CAR-T cell therapy in pediatric oncology while emphasizing critical areas for further investigation to optimize patient outcomes and enhance the therapeutic landscape for pediatric ALL.",0
"Relapsed pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in children. We performed Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq on 12 matched diagnosis/relapse pediatric leukemia specimens to uncover dynamic structural variants (SVs) and 3D chromatin rewiring that may contribute to relapse. While translocations are assumed to occur early in leukemogenesis and be maintained throughout progression, we discovered novel, dynamic translocations and confirmed several fusion transcripts, suggesting functional and therapeutic relevance. Genome-wide chromatin remodeling was observed at all organizational levels: A/B compartments, TAD interactivity, and chromatin loops, including some loci shared by 25% of patients. Shared changes were found to drive the expression of genes/pathways previously implicated in resistance as well as novel therapeutic candidates, two of which (ATXN1 and MN1) we functionally validated. Overall, these results demonstrate chromatin reorganization under the selective pressure of therapy and offer the potential for discovery of novel therapeutic interventions.",0
"Germline Checkpoint Kinase 2 gene ( We describe a case of a pediatric patient with a heterozygous pathogenic germline As conventional chemotherapy and radiation can potentially increase the risk of DNA damage and development of secondary malignancies, CD19 CAR-T therapy (tisagenlecleucel) can be used as a substitute for intensive re-induction chemotherapy and HCT in patients with a germline",0
"Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.",1
"We describe a reversed-phase HPLC method that uses gradient elution and UV detection (325 nm) to determine levels of resveratrol and identify six major conjugated metabolites in the plasma and urine of human volunteers after administration of a single oral dose of 1g. Waters Atlantis C18 3 microm served as the stationary phase. The gradient was formed using ammonium acetate and methanol, containing 2% propan-2-ol. Detection is linear between 5 ng/mL and 500 ng/mL in plasma (5-1000 ng/mL in urine). The coefficient of variation for intra- and inter-day variation is <10%. The average recovery of resveratrol from plasma and urine is 58+/-3%. The data presented in this report demonstrate a rapid, sensitive and accurate method for the analysis of resveratrol and its metabolites in human plasma and urine for pharmacokinetic studies.",1
"The aim of this study was to determine the phenolic profile of seven different varieties of ripe date palm fruit (Phoenix dactylifera) from Algeria by LC–DAD–MS (ESI+), to investigate their respective antioxidant activities by the DPPH· method and to estimate their phenolic content using the Folin–Ciocalteu method. The total phenolic content was in the range of 2.49±0.01 to 8.36±0.60 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 g fresh fruit. This fruit was shown to possess an antioxidant activity, giving values of antiradical efficient (AE) from 0.08±0.00 to 0.22±0.00. The phenolic contents and the antiradical efficiencies of the different varieties were highly correlated (R2=0.975). All the varieties were found to contain mainly p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids and some cinnamic acid derivatives. Three different isomers of 5-o-caffeoylshikimic acid were detected. Different types of flavonoids were identified, mainly flavones, flavanones and flavonol glycosides.",1

"The use of CAR-T is becoming more widespread in the treatment of haematological malignancies. In adults, secondary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) after CAR-T have been described. However, there are currently no data on the risk of MDS following CAR-T in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We studied all children treated with CAR-T cells at Hospital Sant Joan de Déu in Barcelona and those with persistent cytopenias were evaluated at the cytological, cytogenetic, and molecular levels to look for MDS. A total of 106 patients received CAR-T for ALL. Among 40 patients without early relapse or subsequent therapy after CAR-T, four fulfilled the WHO criteria for myelodysplasia. These four patients had received a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) prior to CAR-T and presented cytopenias with severe dysplastic changes in bone marrow after CAR-T. One patient had clonal MDS with high-risk cytogenetics arising from the host cells requiring a HSCT. Three patients had non-progressive dysplasia arising from the donor cells. Two are alive in complete remission with stable cytopenias and one succumbed to ALL relapse. This is the first description of post-CAR-T MDS and haematological dysplasia in children and highlights the need to monitor children with persistent post-CAR-T cytopenias.",0
A novel high-performance liquid chromatography with chemiluminescence detection has been developed for the determination of trans-resveratrol in red wines based on the enhancement by trans-resveratrol of the chemiluminescence from luminol–potassium ferricyanide system in alkaline medium. Samples were separated on a C8 column using isocratic elution of methanol/water (35:65). Quantification of trans-resveratrol in Chinese red wines was performed without any sample pretreatment. It allows for the determination of trans-resveratrol in the range 0.5–750 μg/L with a detection limit of 0.166 μg/L (S/N=3). The relative standard deviation (RSD) is 1.16% for 7.5 μg/L trans-resveratrol (n=11). trans-Resveratrol was detected in Chinese red wines with the recoveries of 92.2–114.7%. Concentrations ranged from 0.072 to 1.607 mg/L in Chinese red wines.,1
"Leprosy is an infectious neglected tropical disease that can result in chronic immune mediated nerve damage. When this involves the facial nerve, this can lead to lagophthalmos, with the later stages requiring surgical correction. If untreated lagophthalmos can cause keratopathies leading to visual impairment and eventual blindness. However, to date no paper has systematically reviewed the surgical management of lagophthalmos in those affected by leprosy. A systematic review was conducted on the 16/11/2024 with data from PubMed, Infolep, Web of Sciences Core Collection and Medline ALL. Data extraction and analysis followed PRISMA guidelines. Included were English-language studies on the outcomes of surgical procedures for the surgical management of lagophthalmos, regardless the year of publication. The 12 papers identified contained data from seven countries. The majority of papers studied Temporalis Muscle transfer. Gillies technique or modifications of this technique were reported in five papers. Three papers reported modifications of Johnson's method of temporalis tendon transfer. One paper reported TMT using a silicone sling. Patients also received TMT using the Brown-McDonnell and the McCord-Cordner techniques. Lagophthalmos was also corrected using gold or steel weight implant techniques. One paper each studied lateral tarsal strip, modified tarsorrhaphy and scapha graft. Treatment of lagophthalmos is vital to preserve vision in those affected by leprosy, however, it is important to take into consideration the practical advantages of the five broad techniques identified by this review. Factors such as the type of anaesthesia, level of expertise, success rate, incidence and risk of complications, and longevity and stability of the results, are vital to consider when conducting these surgical procedures in reduced resource settings. Therefore, operations which are more cost effective, show a reduced complication rate and yield better long-term results without complicated follow-up are more likely to be adopted in lower resource settings.",0
"A preliminary study of the antioxidant content of hand-produced grain derivatives from the Canary Islands, named gofio, is developed by means of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method. Protocatechuic acid, salicylic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid were extracted from corn, wheat, barley and pea gofio samples by sonication with methanol and were successfully separated by CE using a polycation, hexadimetrine bromide (HDB), as electrosmotic flow modifier. The separation was achieved using a running buffer consisting of 125 mM boric acid, 49 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.002% (w/v) HDB and 2.5 mM α-cyclodextrin at pH 7.5. The developed procedure allowed the simultaneous determination of the selected antioxidants in less than 3.5 min. The electrophoretic profile obtained for each kind of flour (corn, wheat, barley and pea) allowed differentiation of the type of gofio. Among the analyzed samples, corn gofio showed the highest antioxidant content. Furthermore, highly roasted corn or wheat gofio samples were also analyzed and their antioxidant contents were lower than those of less roasted samples.",1
"Some polyphenols were determined in 10 red wines of different geographical origins and from single and blended vineyards. The principal aim of this study was to verify the possibility of correlating the concentrating levels of these compounds to the geographical origin of wine and to use the properties of these compounds for wine qualification. An HPLC method was used to determine some flavonols (quercetin, myricetin, apigenin, kaempferol), some anthocyanins (malvidin, peonidin, petunidin, cyanidin, delphinidin), some phenolic acids (gallic, caffeic, caffeoyltartaric, p-coumaric, 2,5-di-S-glutationil-caftaric) and the trans-resveratrol. The results showed differences in the concentration levels of a single antioxidant compound ranging in mg/mL for flavonols from <0.2 (kaempferol) to 11.6 (quercetin), for anthocyanins from <0.4 (petunidin) to 139 (malvidin), for phenolic acids from 2.2 (2,5 di-S-glutationil-caftaric) to 90.5 (gallic) and for trans-resveratrol from 0.2 to 3.1. These differences are not related to the geographical origin of wines, but rather to either to ageing or vineyards. This kind of data could be useful for wine commercial qualification, as “nutritional information”.",1
"Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of freeze-dried and irradiated parsley (Petroselinum crispum) and cilantro (Coriandrum sativum) leaves and stems were determined on methanol and water extracts. The total phenolic content was quantified with the Folin–Ciocalteau reagent. Several mechanisms of potential antioxidant activity of all extracts, including determining relative free radical-scavenging and ferrous ion-chelating activities, as well as reducing power, were examined. Assessment of the total antioxidant activity of all extracts was done using an iron-induced linoleic acid oxidation model system. Antimicrobial activity towards Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli by different extracts was assessed by determining cell damage. Total phenolic content varied between parsley and cilantro, leaf and stem, as well as methanol and water extracts. Methanol-derived leaf extracts exhibited significantly (p<0.05) greater radical-scavenging activity towards both lipid- and water-soluble radicals, which was attributed to the total phenolic content. Ferrous ion-chelating activity was significantly (p<0.05) greater in the stem methanol extracts, and corresponded to antioxidant activity. Prooxidant activity was a feature of all aqueous extracts and corresponded to the reducing activity of both leaf and stem parts of parsley and cilantro. Bacterial cell damage, resulting in significant (p<0.05) greater growth inhibition of B. subtilis and E. coli, corresponded to ferrous sequestering activity of methanol-derived stem extracts.",1
"Acute leukemia (AL) is a life-threatening malignant disease that occurs in the bone marrow and blood, and is classified as either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Diagnosing AL warrants testing methods, such as flow cytometry, which require trained professionals, time, and money. We aimed to develop a model that can classify peripheral blood images of 12 cell types, including pathological cells associated with AL, using artificial intelligence. We acquired 42,386 single-cell images of peripheral blood slides from 282 patients (82 with AML, 40 with ALL, and 160 with immature granulocytes). The performance of EfficientNet-V2 (B2) using the original image size exhibited the greatest accuracy (accuracy, 0.8779; precision, 0.7221; recall, 0.7225; and F1 score, 0.7210). The next-best accuracy was achieved by EfficientNet-V1 (B1), with a 256 × 256 pixels image. F1 score was the greatest for EfficientNet-V1 (B1) with the original image size. EfficientNet-V1 (B1) and EfficientNet-V2 (B2) were used to develop an ensemble model, and the accuracy (0.8858) and F1 score (0.7361) were improved. The classification performance of the developed ensemble model for the 12 cell types was good, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve above 0.9, and F1 scores for myeloblasts and lymphoblasts of 0.8873 and 0.8006, respectively. The performance of the developed ensemble model for the 12 cell classifications was satisfactory, particularly for myeloblasts and lymphoblasts. We believe that the application of our model will benefit healthcare settings where the rapid and accurate diagnosis of AL is difficult.",0
"Although neutropenic fever is frequently observed during chemotherapy, only a minor proportion is caused by blood stream infections (BSI). This study investigated measurements of neutrophil chemotaxis as risk markers for BSI in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL8 were measured weekly in 106 children with ALL during induction treatment. Information regarding BSI episodes was collected from the patients' medical records. During induction treatment, 102 (96%) patients developed profound neutropenia and 27 (25%) were diagnosed with BSI, debuting on median day 12 (range: 4-29). Patients developing BSI had increased levels of CXCL1 on days 8 and 15 as well as increased CXCL8 on days 8, 15, 22, and 29 compared to patients without BSI (all p < 0.05). Patients with BSI < day 12 exhibited increased CXCL1 and CXCL8 levels as early as day 8 (81  vs. 4 pg/mL, p = 0.031 and 35 vs. 10 pg/mL, p < 0.0001, respectively), while CXCL1 and CXCL8 were increased on day 15 (215 vs. 57 pg/mL, p = 0.022 and 68 vs. 17 pg/mL, p = 0.0002) and after (all p < 0.01) in patients with BSI ≥ day 12. The markers of neutrophil chemotaxis, CXCL1, and CXCL8 may help to identify patients at increased risk of BSI during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.",0
"The components responsible for chile hot flavor, capsaicinoids, are synthesized through the cinnamic acid pathway, and their degradation is thought to be aided by the action of peroxidases. This work describes the evolution of capsaicinoids during the development, maturation, and senescence of the fruit in three varieties of hot chile peppers widely used in Mexico [Habañero (Capsicumchinense Jacq.), De árbol (C. annuum var. Annuum), and Piquin (C. annuum var. Aviculare)] and its relation with the activity of peroxidases in these fruits. Capsaicinoids were more abundant in the fruit of Habañero, followed by De árbol and then by Piquin. Capsaicin was higher than dihydrocapsaicin in the three varieties. Capsaicinoids, capsaicin, and dihydrocapsaicin increased continuously and reached a peak after 45−50 days from fruit set (DFFS) in Habañero and De arobol and after 40 DFFS in Piquin and then declined. Peroxidase activity increased at the time when the concentration of capsaicinoids started to decrease. There was an inverse relationship between the evolution of capsaicinoids and peroxidase activity that might indicate that this enzyme is involved in capsaicinoid degradation.",1
"Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of cancer chemopreventive activity.",1
"A liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS(n)) method was established for the analysis of danshensu, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid in rat plasma, bile, urine and feces after oral administration or intravenous injection. Liquid-liquid extraction was employed for the preparation of biosamples, and the chromatographic separation was carried out using an Agilent Zorbax Extend C(18) reversed phase column and acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. Totally nineteen metabolites were detected and identified as prototype, methylated, hydroxylated, sulfated and glucuronized conjugates. The metabolism of the individual phenolic acids in biosamples was investigated, and the metabolic pathway was proposed. By comparing the metabolism of different compounds which shared similar structures, we were able to find that methylation was the main pathway of danshensu metabolism, and the double bond on the side chain was critical for the drug excretion via bile and the formation of glucuronized conjugates. The results proved that the established method was simple, sensitive and reliable, which could be used to detect and identify the structures of metabolites and to better understand their in vivo metabolism.",1
"This study aimed to examine the impact of leukemia and other cancers in India and to observe any changes over time. Detailed estimates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 30 types of cancers in India were analyzed for 29 years from 1990 to 2019 as part of the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study. Data from all available sources were used to gather information on the overall burden of disease in India. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with varying rates of incidence in India, making prevention and treatment a challenge. Because cancer is not a reportable disease in India, the overall burden estimate is still a work in progress. This study analyzed the impact of leukemia and other cancers in India, including trends in incidence, DALYs, and mortality related to all cancers and various malignancies. The causes of leukemia in India were also explored. The study found the trends of cancer types that account for the majority of leukemia-related and cancer-related DALYs, death, prevalence, and incidence in India. Among the four most frequent malignancies, such as leukemia, there was significant variation based on age. Over the last 29 years, mortality from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) has decreased, while deaths from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have increased steadily.",0
"Fresh figs were subjected to two different drying processes: sun-drying and oven-drying. To assess their effect on the nutritional and health-related properties of figs, sugars, organic acids, single phenolics, total phenolics, and antioxidant activity were determined before and after processing. Samples were analyzed three times in a year, and phenolic compounds were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). In figs, monomer sugars predominate, which is important nutritional information, and the content of sugars as well as organic acids in fresh figs was lower than in dried fruits. However, the best sugar/organic acid ratio was measured after the sun-drying process. Analysis of individual phenolic compounds revealed a higher content of all phenolic groups determined after the oven-drying process, with the exception of cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside. Similarly, higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were detected after the drying process. With these results it can be concluded that the differences in analyzed compounds in fresh and dried figs are significant. The differences between the sun-dried and oven-dried fruits were determined in organic acids, sugars, chlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, luteolin-8-C-glucoside, and total phenolic contents. The results indicate that properly dried figs can be used as a good source of phenolic compounds.",1
"High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.",1
"Postural dysfunction is a common problem in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may lead to functional dependency and increasing morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology of postural dysfunction in AD patients remains poorly understood. Elevated intestinal permeability is an underlying contributor to multiple diseases, including AD. We aimed to investigate the association of elevated intestinal permeability with postural dysfunction in AD patients. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study on older adults, including controls and AD patients. We investigated the associations of postural balance with plasma zonulin, a marker of elevated intestinal permeability in geriatric controls (n = 74) and patients with mild (n = 71) and moderate (n = 66) AD. We used a standardized physical performance battery to measure balance in supine, tandem, and semi-tandem positions. We also measured handgrip strength (HGS), and gait speed as markers of physical capacity. AD patients exhibited lower balance scores, HGS, and gait speed and higher plasma zonulin than in controls (all p < 0.05). Plasma zonulin levels demonstrated significant areas under the curves in diagnosing poor balance in AD patients (all p < 0.05). Moderate AD was associated with lower balance and physical capacity, and higher zonulin than mild AD (ALL P < 0.05). Poor scores on balance scale were associated with higher expressions of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and muscle damage providing a mechanistic link between increased intestinal permeability and postural dysfunction in AD patients. The results of our study show that plasma zonulin measurement may be used to diagnose postural dysfunction in AD patients. The study is relevant to non-ambulant and/or comatose AD patients with postural dysfunction. Our findings also highlight the therapeutic potential of repairing the intestinal leak to improve postural control and reduce the risk of falls in AD patients.",0
"This article reports two cases of children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) complicated by invasive fungal disease (IFD) who received bridging treatment using blinatumomab. Case 1 was a 4-month-old female infant who experienced recurrent high fever and limb weakness during chemotherapy. Blood culture was negative, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid were all negative. Chest CT and cranial MRI revealed obvious infection foci. Case 2 was a 2-year-old male patient who experienced recurrent high fever with multiple inflammatory masses during chemotherapy. Candida tropicalis was detected in peripheral blood and abscess fluid using NGS, while blood culture and imaging examinations showed no obvious abnormalities. After antifungal and blinatumomab therapy, both cases showed significant improvement in symptoms, signs, and imaging, and B-ALL remained in continuous remission. The report indicates that bridging treatment with blinatumomab in children with B-ALL complicated by IFD can rebuild the immune system and control the underlying disease in the presence of immunosuppression and severe fungal infection. 该文报道2例接受贝林妥欧单抗桥接治疗的急性B淋巴细胞白血病（B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-ALL）合并侵袭性真菌病（invasive fungal disease, IFD）患儿。病例1为4个月女婴，化疗期间反复高热伴肢体肌力下降，血培养及外周血、支气管肺泡灌洗液、脑脊液二代测序（next-generation sequencing, NGS）均阴性，但胸部CT和头颅MRI可见明显感染灶。病例2为2岁男性患儿，化疗期间反复高热伴多部位炎性包块，外周血及包块脓液NGS均检出热带念珠菌，血培养及影像学检查未见明显异常。2例患儿经抗真菌和贝林妥欧单抗治疗后症状、体征及影像学表现明显好转，并且B-ALL处于持续缓解状态。该报道表明，B-ALL合并IFD患儿接受贝林妥欧单抗桥接治疗可在免疫抑制合并严重真菌感染时重建免疫系统并控制原发病。.",0
"The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. The latter four were obtained here as products of small scale chemical synthesis in a preliminary study on the tentative identification of urinary isoflavonoids in human volunteers challenged with soya.",1
"A simple high performance liquid chromatographic analysis for tea catechins, caffeine and gallic acid with an isocratic elution system was developed. The separation system consisted of a C18 reversed-phase column, an isocratic elution system of methanol/water/orthophosphoric acid, and an UV detector. This method is ideally suited for rapid, routine analysis for the determination of catechins in green tea with good repeatability and accuracy of results. Furthermore, this method can be applied to all kinds of tea and tea products, and is especially useful for the determination of (+)-catechin, which was regarded as being in too low a concentration to detect, and (−)-gallocatechin gallate, which was regarded as a measure for heat treatment for green tea.",1
"The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) (WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the present experimental conditions.",1
"Cancer stands as a significant cause of mortality among children and adolescents, imposing a considerable burden on global healthcare. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports a stark imbalance in the accessibility of cancer medicines between low-income and high-income countries. Due to high prevalence of cancer in Iran and current barriers to access to oncology medicines, this study aims to scrutinize the landscape of pediatric oncology medicine access, considering unique factors such as sanctions and Iran’s economic context. This study was conducted in Urmia (West Azerbaijan, Iran) in 2022. We employed a descriptive cross-sectional design to explore the availability, pricing, and affordability of 21 outpatient medications related to the five most utilized treatment protocols for prevalent pediatric cancers. A systematic survey was carried out using the recognized methodologies of the WHO and Health Action International (HAI). Data extraction was conducted by a trained student using the checklist provided by the WHO. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS software. Among the 21 medicines analyzed, 14 had accessibility rates that were below 50%, with one entirely unavailable and 10 exhibiting availability below 25%. Dactinomycin highlighted the highest Median Price Ratio at 4.1, closely followed by Asparaginase at 3.9. Conversely, Cytarabine, Cyclophosphamide, and Filgrastim displayed the lowest Median Price Ratios (MPR) values, each recording an MPR of 0.1. In the assessment of affordability, it is observed that insured patients across all income deciles have the financial means to cover the minimum costs of medicines. Intriguingly, among the various income deciles, only individuals in the 10th decile exhibit the financial capacity to acquire medicines associated with the examined treatment regimens without insurance coverage, with the exception of the ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) regimen. This study illuminates the complex challenges surrounding the availability, cost, and affordability of pediatric cancer medications in Urmia, Iran. It is crucial to develop supportive policies that aim to lower medication expenses for patients and improve their access to cancer treatments. Tackling these challenges necessitates a collaborative effort involving stakeholders, policymakers, and healthcare providers.

"Recent interest in food phenolics has increased greatly, because of their antioxidant and free radical scavenging abilities. Popular beverages in the world include tea, coffee, cocoa, beer, wine and fruit/vegetable juices. All of these beverages contain phenolic compounds. In present study total polyphenol content and in vitro antioxidant properties were investigated in 16 red wines, 5 white wines, 5 lager beers, 3 dark beers, 17 fruit juices and 5 vegetable juices. High polyphenol content was measured in red wines (1720 +/- 546 mg x L(-1)) and in some fruit juices such as elderberry and prunes (5,680 and 1,807 mg x L(-1), respectively). The concentration of polyphenols was between 159 and 5,680 mg x L(-1) in fruit juices and between 255 and 696 mg x L(-1) in vegetable ones, while low level of phenolics was observed in dark and lager beers and white wines (473, 376 and 392 mg x L(-1), respectively). All samples exhibited significant antioxidant properties such as hydrogen-donating ability, reducing power, chelating ability and total antioxidant status (TAS) value. These antioxidant properties strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content of the beverages.",1
"The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 38.6% of intake.",1
"CD109 is overexpressed in various tumors, but its role in hematologic malignancies, particularly acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), remains unclear. CD109 expression was assessed at both mRNA and protein levels in B-ALL patients using real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). The relationship between CD109 expression and clinical and laboratory parameters was examined. The potential of CD109 as a marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection was evaluated. Functional studies were conducted in leukemia cell lines. CD109 mRNA was significantly upregulated in newly diagnosed and relapsed B-ALL patients compared to healthy controls and remission cases. MFC revealed CD109 positivity in 79.0% B-ALL patients, with higher rates in relapsed cases (85.7%) and CD34 + B-ALL patients. CD109 expression was minimal in mature B cells and precursors B cell. CD109 expression remained stable across disease phases including diagnosis, MRD positivity, and relapse. Functional assays demonstrated that CD109-positive Nalm6 cells exhibited significantly increased proliferative and invasive abilities. CD109 is upregulated in B-ALL and promotes leukemia cell proliferation and migration. Its consistent expression across disease stages suggests it may be a promising marker for MRD detection, highlighting its clinical significance in leukemia management.",0
"A phenyl propanoid glycoside, cinnamoyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (CIN), characteristic of blood oranges, was isolated by column and thin layer chromatographies. The structure of this compound was established using 1H and 13C NMR spectral data and by analysis of its components upon hydrolysis. Flavanone glycosides (FGs) [narirutin (NAT), hesperidin (HES), and didymin (DID)] and cinnamic derivatives [CIN and trans-cinnamic acid (TCA)] of four blood orange varieties (47 samples) were analyzed by HPLC. Differences in the polyphenol profiles clearly showed variety differentiation.",1
"Postpartum depression is a debilitating mental health disorder, which occurs in approximately 6% to 13% of women who give birth in high-income countries. It is a cause of great suffering for women and can have long-term consequences for child development. Postpartum depression can also negatively influence breastfeeding duration and breastfeeding exclusivity (i.e. feeding the infant only breast milk). However, a positive early, and continued, breastfeeding experience may reduce the risk of having postpartum depression. Breastfeeding interventions that increase the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding may help prevent or reduce postpartum depressive symptoms. The primary objective of this review was to assess the effect (benefits and harms) of breastfeeding support interventions, in comparison to standard perinatal care, on maternal postpartum depression. The secondary objective was to assess whether breastfeeding support interventions had an effect on depression symptoms, and whether the effect was dependent on the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding. We searched CENTRAL (Wiley), MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL Complete (Ebsco) and several other bibliographic databases and trial registers. The most recent search was conducted in June 2024. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated educational, psychosocial, pharmacological, alternative (any breastfeeding support intervention that promotes relaxation and reduces stress) or herbal breastfeeding support interventions targeting the prevention or reduction of postpartum depression were eligible for inclusion. Each title and abstract we identified was screened by two authors independently. Two review authors then independently examined full-text manuscripts to decide if the study met the inclusion criteria. If so, they extracted data from included studies using Covidence software. Two review authors also independently conducted a risk of bias assessment of each study using the RoB 2 tool. We contacted study authors when necessary for more information. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We included 10 RCTs with 1573 participants in this review. Depression was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in all studies, where scores range between 0 and 30 (higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms). The studies used a score of over 10 as the cut-off for a diagnosis of depression. Primary outcome It is very uncertain whether psychosocial breastfeeding interventions had any effect on the incidence of postpartum depression immediately post-intervention (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.70; 1 study, 30 participants), but we found low-certainty evidence that psychosocial breastfeeding interventions may prevent the incidence of postpartum depression in the short term (one to three months) post-intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.93; 1 study, 82 participants). It is very uncertain whether alternative breastfeeding interventions had any effect in preventing the incidence of postpartum depression immediately post-intervention (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.54; 1 study, 60 participants). The short-term time point was not measured. Secondary outcomes It is very uncertain whether psychosocial breastfeeding interventions had any effect on reducing depressive symptoms immediately post-intervention (mean difference (MD) -0.67, 95% CI -1.63 to 0.28; 4 studies, 512 participants). There is very low-certainty evidence that psychosocial breastfeeding interventions could reduce symptoms of anxiety immediately post-intervention as measured with the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), where scores between 45 and 59 out of 80 on the SAS indicate mild to moderate anxiety, scores between 60 and 74 marked severe anxiety levels and > 75 extreme anxiety levels (MD -2.30, 95% CI -4.36 to -0.24; 1 study, 100 participants). There was no difference in rates of exclusive breastfeeding immediately post-intervention between those offered a psychosocial breastfeeding intervention and those receiving standard care, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.51; I There is low-certainty evidence that psychosocial breastfeeding interventions may prevent postpartum depression in the short term and increase the duration of breastfeeding in the long-term. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of psychosocial breastfeeding interventions on other outcomes. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of alternative breastfeeding interventions on postpartum depression or other outcomes. The included studies did not report any adverse events directly related to the interventions, but it is not clear if this outcome was measured in most studies. Future trials of breastfeeding interventions should be conducted carefully to reduce their risk of bias, and they should be large enough to detect differences between mothers in their mental health.",0
"Low 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) adherence (< 95%) is associated with increased relapse in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Stronger habit has been associated with higher adherence. We examined the relationship of 6-MP adherence to habit strength and health-related quality of life in pediatric ALL. A single-center, cross-sectional study of 52 participants: 11 patients (mean age 16 ± 4) and 41 parents/caregivers (age 37 ± 5). Participants completed Visual Analogue Scale (VAS 81% (42/52) of participants reported high 6-MP adherence (VAS One-fifth of participants reported low 6-MP adherence, with habit strength not associated with adherence. Variability of 6-MP routines may prohibit automaticity. While 6-MP adherence may not correlate with habit strength, interventions promoting and strengthening habit formation may overcome barriers to 6-MP adherence and improve outcomes.",0
"ETV6::ABL1 is a rare fusion gene that found in MPN, ALL, and AML. It has a complex and diverse formation mechanism due to the reciprocal orientations of the ETV6 and ABL1 genes relative to the centromeres. NPM1 is frequently mutated in adult AML, often accompanied by FLT3-ITD, which suggests molecular synergisms in AML pathogenesis. Previous reports on ETV6::ABL1 mostly focus on FLT3-ITD. In this study, we present a case of AML with ETV6::ABL1, along with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD. The patient showed a rapid increase in primitive cells at the initial stage, along with the presence of immature granulocytes and erythrocytes. Through cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq, we elucidated the mechanism behind the formation of the ETV6::ABL1 fusion gene. Despite conventional chemotherapy failure and rapid tumor proliferation, we attempted to add FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib to the treatment, along with chemotherapy bridging to haploidentical transplantation. After haplo-HSCT, a combination of sorafenib and dasatinib was administered as maintenance therapy. The patient achieved complete remission (CR) and maintained it for 11 months. The intricate genetic landscape observed in this case presents diagnostic dilemmas and therapeutic challenges, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of its implications for disease classification, risk stratification, and treatment selection.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, and B-cell ALL (B-ALL) is the most common subtype. The understanding of ALL has advanced significantly in recent years due to genomic sequencing, which has made it possible to identify genetic variants and detect the association between ""single nucleotide polymorphisms"" (SNP) and certain diseases. We evaluated 126 patients diagnosed with B-ALL in hospitals in Rio de Janeiro. We described the frequency of polymorphisms in the IKZF1, CDKN2A/2B genes, the contribution of these genetic variants in pediatric ALL, and compared them with the general population of Rio de Janeiro. We demonstrated that the SNPs rs3731217, rs4132601, and rs11978267 were more frequent in patients with B-ALL. These findings contribute to a more complete understanding of B-ALL. They can guide future studies, bringing new perspectives on personalized therapies with reduced side effects and optimization efficacy of B-ALL treatment in children.",0
"The antiatherogenic activity of pomegranate juice has been attributed to its antioxidant polyphenols. The most potent in vitro antioxidant polyphenol from this juice is the ellagitannin punicalagin. However, the bioavailability of ellagitannins, including punicalagin, has not been previously described in humans.",1
"Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, many ALL patients eventually develop relapse and treating relapsed ALL has always been challenging. Therefore, exploring the resistance mechanism of chemotherapeutic drugs and proposing feasible intervention strategies are of great significance for ALL treatment. Here, we show that",0
"Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of whole grains and grain-based products is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. The health benefits of whole grains are attributed in part to their unique phytochemical composition. However, the phytochemical contents in grains have been commonly underestimated in the literature, because bound phytochemicals were not included. This study was designed to investigate the complete phytochemical profiles in free, soluble conjugated, and insoluble bound forms, as well as their antioxidant activities in uncooked whole grains. Corn had the highest total phenolic content (15.55 +/- 0.60 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain) of the grains tested, followed by wheat (7.99 +/- 0.39 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain), oats (6.53 +/- 0.19 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain), and rice (5.56 +/- 0.17 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain). The major portion of phenolics in grains existed in the bound form (85% in corn, 75% in oats and wheat, and 62% in rice), although free phenolics were frequently reported in the literature. Ferulic acid was the major phenolic compound in grains tested, with free, soluble-conjugated, and bound ferulic acids present in the ratio 0.1:1:100. Corn had the highest total antioxidant activity (181.42 +/- 0.86 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), followed by wheat (76.70 +/- 1.38 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), oats (74.67 +/- 1.49 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), and rice (55.77 +/- 1.62 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain). Bound phytochemicals were the major contributors to the total antioxidant activity: 90% in wheat, 87% in corn, 71% in rice, and 58% in oats. Bound phytochemicals could survive stomach and intestinal digestion to reach the colon. This may partly explain the mechanism of grain consumption in the prevention of colon cancer, other digestive cancers, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, which is supported by epidemiological studies.",1
"Eight flavonols were detected in rowanberry juice, six quercetin and two kaempferol glycosides which were identified as quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, two quercetin 3-O-dihexosides, quercetin pentose-hexoside and quercetin hexose-pentoside and two kaempferol dihexosides. The total content of identified flavonols in the rowanberry juice was 291 mg L–1. Quercetin dihexosides contributed 78% to the flavonol content. However, chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the rowanberry juice (544 and 273 mg L–1, respectively). From a nutritional point of view, rowanberry juice provides 70 mg of flavonols and 196 mg of chlorogenic acids per serving. HPLC-MSn and HPLC-DAD in combination with solid phase extraction were used to obtain these results.",1
"Daidzein is an estrogenic isoflavone present in many plants and therefore consumed in relatively high doses by humans. Daidzein has a low affinity for the estrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been demonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high doses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats fed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats were orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were collected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were quantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and daidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and daidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted for < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein elimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive daidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, O-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). Excretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with elimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and feces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The results suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as conjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the gastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak estrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other estrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.",1
"Reliable and economical quantification of micronutrients in diets and human is a critical component of successful epidemiological studies to establish relationships between dietary constituents and chronic disease. Legumes are one of the major dietary components consumed by populations worldwide. Consumption of legumes is thought to play a major role in lowering breast and prostate cancer risk. In this study, a simplified method that uses solid-phase extraction and gas chromatography was developed to measure isoflavones at levels down to 10 micrograms/5ml. With the use of this method, 12.5 g miso (a soybean paste), 12 ounces Isomil, and 12 ounces soymilk had daidzin/daidzein levels of 2, 5, and 12.4 mg, respectively, and genistin/genistein levels of 3, 6.5, and 13.7 mg, respectively. In these products, most of the isoflavones were present as glucosides. With the same method, urinary levels of isoflavones in six 15-17-year-old subjects were determined after soymilk ingestion. Each subject was placed on unrestricted nonsoya diets, and three 12-ounce portions of soymilk were given at 12-h intervals. Males excreted 15.02 +/- 2.74 (SD) mg of daidzein glucuronides/sulfates [mean recovery, 40.4 +/- 7.4% (SD)] by 24 h after the third soymilk ingestion, whereas females excreted 25.56 +/- 5.10 mg (68.7 +/- 13.7%) of daidzein conjugates, which was more than males (P = 0.02). Males and females excreted 7.73 +/- 1.95 mg and 9.11 +/- 0.84 mg of genistein glucuronides/sulfates (20% recovery of genistin intake), respectively, in the urine. Most of the isoflavones were excreted within 24 h after ingestion.",1
"Sesame exhibits many beneficial physiological effects, which are mostly related to its lignan compounds, such as sesaminol glucosides. This investigation studies the distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside from sesame in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In order to investigate the distribution of sesaminol triglucoside (p.o. 500 mg/kg) in SD rats, the changes in concentration of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites were determined in tissues and plasma within 24 h period after tube-feeding to SD rats. Results showed that sesaminol triglucoside may be deglycosylated to form sesaminol first by intestinal microflora and then incorporated via lymphatic absorption into the cardiovascular system, transported to other tissues. The concentrations of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rectum, caecum, colon, and small intestines are higher than those in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. Its concentration in brain is low but detectable. Glucuronidation and sulfation was the main metabolic pathway for sesaminol in urine, and fecal elimination was a major route of elimination. From LC/MS/MS analysis of rat organs, sesaminol triglucoside can be converted to mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END), and enterolactone (ENL), by rat intestinal microflora. In the plasma, concentrations of END and ENL were 5.9 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 micromol/mL, respectively.",1
"The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells are an emerging therapy for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. While CD19 CAR-T cells have been FDA-approved, CAR T-cells targeting CD22, as well as dual-targeting CD19/CD22 CAR T-cells, are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD22-targeting CAR T-cell therapies. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to March 3rd 2022 for full-length articles and conference abstracts of clinical trials employing CD22-targeting CAR T-cells in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The primary outcome was best complete response (bCR). A DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model with arcsine transformation was used to pool outcome proportions. From 1068 references screened, 100 were included, representing 30 early phase studies with 637 patients, investigating CD22 or CD19/CD22 CAR T-cells. CD22 CAR T-cells had a bCR of 68% [95% CI, 53-81%] in ALL (n= 116), and 64% [95% CI, 46-81%] in NHL (n= 28) with 74% and 96% of patients having received anti-CD19 CAR T-cells previously in ALL and NHL studies respectively. CD19/CD22 CAR T-cells had a bCR rate of 90% [95% CI, 84-95%] in ALL (n= 297) and 47% [95% CI, 34-61%] in NHL (n= 137). The estimated incidence of total and severe (grade ≥3) CRS were 87% [95% CI, 80-92%] and 6% [95% CI, 3-9%] respectively. ICANS and severe ICANS had an estimated incidence of 16% [95% CI, 9-25%] and 3% [95% CI, 1-5%] respectively. Early phase trials of CD22 and CD19/CD22 CAR T-cells show high remission rates in ALL and NHL. Severe CRS or ICANS were (1)rare and dual-targeting did not increase toxicity. Variability in CAR construct, dose, and patient factors amongst studies limits comparisons, with long-term outcomes yet to be reported. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier CRD42020193027.",0
"The characteristics and prognosis of Japanese children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who fail to achieve complete remission after remission induction chemotherapy (i.e., experience induction failure) are poorly understood. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed data of patients enrolled in Japanese clinical trials for newly diagnosed ALL between 1996 and 2009. Among 4956 participants, 89 (1.8%) experienced induction failure. With a 6.0-year median follow-up, the 5-year overall survival rate of the entire cohort was 43.0% ± 5.5%. Survival rates did not differ between patients with B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) and T-cell ALL (T-ALL). In multivariate analysis, day 15 M3 marrow (bone marrow blast count ≥ 25%) was significantly correlated with poorer survival in the whole or BCP-ALL cohorts. In T-ALL, age < 6 years was significantly associated with poor survival. However, due to the small sample size, this correlation must be further investigated. Most T-ALL and BCR-ABL-positive BCP-ALL patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Survival rates did not differ between BCR-ABL-negative BCP-ALL patients who did and did not undergo allo-SCT, possibly due to the inclusion of lower-risk patients in the latter group. In conclusion, the induction failure rate and survival after diagnosis of induction failure in our study were comparable to previously reported figures.",0
"We describe chemical hydrolytic procedures to evaluate the total amount of tyrosol and hydroxy-tyrosol free and/or linked to secoiridoidic molecules (acid hydrolysis). At the same time a rapid determination of the lignans in complex minor polar compound (MPC) extracts is proposed (alkaline hydrolysis). High-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detection (HPLC/DAD) and HPLC/MS were applied as reference methods to evaluate the quantitative results from the hydrolysis experiments. The optimized acid hydrolysis procedures were first applied to an oleuropein standard and then to MPC fractions extracted from several commercial extra virgin olive oils. The results confirm the applicability of the method, consisting in the acid hydrolysis of complex mixtures of secoiridoidic derivatives, to determine the antioxidant potential in terms of MPC. These data can contribute to forecasting the potential ageing resistance of an extra virgin olive oil in terms of antioxidant potency. Finally, alkaline hydrolysis allows confirmation and easy determination of the amount of lignans, especially in those MPC fractions which are particularly complex. ",1
"A chemoport is widely used in paediatric oncology population. Removal is a relatively easy procedure, but difficulty can be encountered in case the catheter is densely adherent to the vascular wall. It is a rare complication and is associated with long indwelling duration and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Forceful traction can lead to vascular injury and high morbidity. Herein, we report a 7-year-old girl with precursor B ALL who had delayed chemoport removal due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The removal process was difficult, as the catheter was adherent to the right innominate vein. Out of panic, the surgeon pulled it out forcefully. Fortunately, the catheter and its fragment were successfully retrieved completely and the child was discharged the next day. The management strategy varies and ranges from minimally invasive to open surgery. Leaving a stuck chemoport catheter in situ can be a bailout method or part of conservative management.",0
"The present work studies the effect of the boiling on the 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA) content of potatoes and carrots and investigates the susceptibility of the 5-CQA to a oven heating at 40, 100, or 220°C for 5, 15, 30, 45 or 60 min. A significant reduction (p<0.05) in 5-CQA content of both boiled potatoes (72%) and carrots (48%) was due mainly to its high rate of diffusion in water. Only trace amounts of 5-CQA were destroyed when heating was at 40°C. At 100°C, there was a initial loss of 6% after 5 min and final loss of 24% after 60 min. At 220°C, the loss was of 60% after 15 min. Under drastic conditions (220°C for 30–60 min), only trace amounts of 5-CQA standard were found. ©",1
"Although recent studies have demonstrated associations between nonchromosomal birth defects and several pediatric cancers, less is known about their role on childhood leukemia susceptibility. Using data from the Childhood Cancer and Leukemia International Consortium, we evaluated associations between nonchromosomal birth defects and childhood leukemia. Pooling consortium data from 18 questionnaire-based and three registry-based case-control studies across 13 countries, we used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between a spectrum of birth defects and leukemia. Our analyses included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 13 115) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n = 2120) cases, along with 46 172 controls. We used the false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons. In the questionnaire-based studies, the prevalence of birth defects was 5% among cases vs 4% in controls, whereas, in the registry-based studies, the prevalence was 11% among cases vs 7% in controls. In pooled adjusted analyses, there were several notable associations, including (1) digestive system defects and ALL (OR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.46-4.98); (2) congenital anomalies of the heart and circulatory system and AML (OR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.81-4.52) and (3) nervous system defects and AML (OR = 4.23, 95% CI: 1.50-11.89). Effect sizes were generally larger in registry-based studies. Overall, our results could point to novel genetic and environmental factors associated with birth defects that could also increase leukemia susceptibility. Additionally, differences between questionnaire- and registry-based studies point to the importance of complementary sources of birth defect phenotype data when exploring these associations.",0
"An isocratic HPLC procedure was developed for simultaneous determination of six catechins, gallic acid, and three methylxanthines in tea water extract. A baseline separation was achieved on a Cosmosil C18-MS packed column with a solvent mixture of methanol/doubly distilled water/formic acid (19.5:80.2:0.3, v/v/v) as mobile phase. A gradient HPLC procedure was also provided for the separation of these tea components. The contents of catechins, gallic acid, and methylxanthines have been measured in infusions of a range of green tea, oolong tea, and pu-erh tea products sold and consumed in the China, Japan, and Taiwan. When 15 Chinese green tea and 13 Japanese green tea products were analyzed by the HPLC method, the mean levels of the total catechins, (−)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate, (+)-catechin, and caffeine were found to be very similar in these two groups, but other minor catechins such as (−)-epigallocatechin, (−)-epicatechin, and (−)-gallocatechin 3-gallate were found to be higher in Japanese green tea products, whereas (−)-epicatechin 3-gallate, gallic acid, theophylline, and theobromine were found to be higher in Chinese green tea products. Oolong tea products possessed lower levels of catechins, whereas pu-erh tea products contained negligible amounts of these constituents. The new HPLC method is rapid, reliable, and reproducible and should be highly recommended to tea industries for routine analysis of commercial tea samples.",1
"The final manufactured tisagenlecleucel product should meet the commercial product release specifications to ensure the quality in terms of safety, purity, identity, and potency. However, it may occasionally fail to meet these specifications due to the nature of patient-derived cells with variable properties as starting material and the complex manufacturing process. The final product that does not meet at least one of the commercial release specifications is referred to as ""out-of-specification"" (OOS). However, the benefit-risk profile of OOS tisagenlecleucel has not yet been fully elucidated. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of OOS tisagenlecleucel in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase 3b study (NCT04094311). Patients consistent with label indication were enrolled and followed-up for 3 months. Of the 29 patients enrolled between December 2019 and May 2022 across 13 qualified sites in Japan, 28 received tisagenlecleucel, and of these, 23 had r/r DLBCL and 5 had r/r B-ALL. The primary reasons for OOS were low cell viability (15 of 24 batches) and low dose (8 of 23 batches) tisagenlecleucel in the r/r DLBCL group, and high dose (4 of 5 batches) in the r/r B-ALL group. In patients with r/r DLBCL, the grade 3 or 4 cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 3 and 1 patients, respectively. Response assessments were performed for 15 of 23 patients with r/r DLBCL: 6 achieved a complete response, and 1 achieved a partial response as the best response within 3 months. Despite the limited patient sample size, our findings affirm that the infusion of OOS tisagenlecleucel is a viable option, with no observed increase in toxicity and outcomes comparable to those of in-specification products in clinical and real-world studies.",0
"Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.",1
"A liquid chromatography method with multi-channel electrochemical detection is reported for the identification and determination of polyphenols in green tea, black tea, and extracted green tea powder. Following a simple aqueous extraction, (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (+)-catechin (C), (−)-epicatechin (EC), (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (−)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), (−)-gallocatechin (GC), (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), and (−)-catechin gallate (CG) were successfully separated by reversed phase liquid chromatography within 25 min. The detection limits (S/N=3) of the polyphenols studied were 0.1–1.5 ng/mL at a potential of +900mV. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 1–1000 ng/mL for EGC, C, EC, EGCG, GCG, and GC, 5–1000 ng/mL for ECG and CG. Using this method, the concentration of these eight polyphenols in five different brands of green tea, one brand of black tea, and extracted green tea powder were determined.",1
"The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink wine.",1
"Over the years, several methods have been developed for the segmentation of cell images. Most of the related techniques operate directly on the raw data (noisy cell samples) of the medical image which leads to adverse effects on the structure of leucocytes because the medical images are affected by multiple distortions (varying illumination, deficient background light intensity, and non-uniform staining). To overcome these problems, we came up with an improved solution that performs the qualitative enhancement of cell images for the smooth extraction of cell-nucleus. Although various segmentation methods have adopted an image improvement operation in practice. These methods also amplify the magnitude of image noise which leads to over-sampling and under-sampling of data points. This mis-labelling of data points is minimized by the developed approach which adopts a collaborative fusion strategy (CNN and Nuclear-norm approach) for the qualitative improvement of cell images. The enhanced cell samples were forwarded to the U-net (deep learning model) model for the semantic segmentation of cell images. The performance evaluation of the model was performed on three biomedical cell imaging datasets, which include the ALL-IDB (99.89% accuracy, 99.51% recall, and 99.01% precision), CellaVision (99.68% accuracy, 98.75% precision, and 97.94% specificity) and JTSC (98.45% accuracy, 97.42% precision, and 97.21% specificity) dataset. The results were compared with the state-of-art methods in which the adopted hybrid approach has overpowered the related techniques in the quantitative and qualitative domains.",0

"Two commonly consumed plant foods, onion bulbs and asparagus spears, were subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping, maceration, and boiling. The impact of these processes on flavonol content was assessed. Further, the consequences of these processes on the antioxidant capacity of the tissues were evaluated with the beta-carotene bleaching method. Chopping significantly affected rutin content in asparagus, yielding an 18.5% decrease in 60 min; but in onions, quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside (Q(DG)) and quercetin 4'-glucoside (Q(MG)) were virtually unaffected by chopping. Boiling for 60 min had more severe effects, as it caused overall flavonol losses of 20.6 and 43.9% in onions and asparagus, respectively. Chopping of tissues did not considerably influence the antioxidant capacity, but boiling did provoke notable changes.",1
"Many reports have described the bioavailability of anthocyanins; however, most of these reports investigated only the amount of anthocyanins excreted in urine. In the present study, we calculated the pharmacokinetic bioavailability of anthocyanins in rats by measuring the plasma concentration of delphinidin-3-rutinoside that had been administered orally or intravenously. Delphinidin-3-rutinoside was primarily absorbed in the blood and excreted into urine as unmetabolized forms with a Tmax of 26.3 min and a Cmax of 0.285 ± 0.071 μmol/L. We detected small amounts of the metabolite 4‘-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside in the plasma, but we detected neither anthocyanidin (aglycone) nor glucuro- or sulfoconjugates. For the 8 h period after intake, delphinidin-3-rutinoside and 4‘-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside were excreted to urine at 795 ± 375 and 12.3 ± 2.91 nmol, respectively. Relative to intravenous injection, oral administration of delphinidin-3-rutinoside resulted in complete bioavailability (0.49 ± 0.06%). Analysis of delphinidin-3-rutinoside plasma concentrations in bile cannulated rats revealed that, for the 8-h period after intake, the intact delphinidin-3-rutinoside excretion ratio in bile was 11% of the excretion ratio of 4‘-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside, 1.91 ± 0.35 nmol versus 17.4 ± 8.67 nmol, respectively. Setting the bile duct cannulation in a Bollman-type cage, however, significantly increased the bioavailability of orally administered delphinidin-3-rutinoside (18.14 ± 6.24%). This effect appears to stem immobilization stress by reducing gastrointestinal motility. The cumulative excretion of delphinidin-3-rutinoside and 4‘-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside in urine and bile was 2.67 ± 1.24% (w/w) of the dose ingested. Studies report that several metabolites are formed after oral ingestion of anthocyanins. Examples include glucuronyl from cyanidin-3-glucoside and both glucuronyl and sulfate conjugates from pelargonidin-3-glucoside. Our results indicate that delphinidin-3-rutinoside might be metabolized differently from cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-glucoside.",1
"A rapid and reliable capillary zone electrophoresis method was used as a tool to obtain both qualitative and quantitative information about simple phenols, lignans, complex phenols (isomeric forms of secoiridoids), phenolic acids, and flavonoids in the solid-phase separation extracts from different Spanish extra-virgin olive oil in a short time (less than 6 min). Peak identification was done by using commercial and HPLC-isolated standards, studying the information of the electropherograms obtained at several wavelengths and also using the information previously reported. For the quantification of lignans and complex phenols (secoiridoid derivatives), we used a reference compound (oleuropein glucoside) at two different wavelengths (200 and 240 nm) and for the quantification of tyrosol and flavonoids, we used their commercially available standards.",1

The anthocyanins were characterized using chromatographic and spectroscopic methods as delphinidin 3-glucoside (56%), petunidin 3-glucoside (26%), and malvidin 3-glucoside (18%). The monomeric anthocyanin content was 213 ± 2 mg/100 g of black beans (moisture content was 10.04 ± 0.02%).",1
"Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular biomolecules.",1
"This retrospective study evaluated two groups: patients receiving RFA for PVI, posterior wall isolation, mitral isthmus, and coronary sinus (CS) ablation with adjunctive VOM ethanol injection (VOM/RFA ALL (N = 53)), and patients receiving PVI with PFA using pentaspline catheter followed by mitral isthmus and CS ablation with RFA (PFA PV + PW/RFA MITRAL (N = 12)). We hypothesized that PFA for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) facilitates mitral block without adjunctive vein of Marshall (VOM) ethanol injection. Mitral block was achieved in 92.5% of VOM/RFA ALL patients and 83.3% of the PFA PV + PW/RFA MITRAL group (p = 0.31). Endocardial ablation time of the mitral isthmus and RF applications required to achieve a complete block were significantly shorter in the VOM/RFA ALL group (208 s vs 356 s, p < 0.01 and 14.5 vs 24.0, p < 0.01, respectively). Adjunctive VOM ethanol injection appears to still have a role for facilitation of mitral isthmus block in the new era of PFA.",0
"The integration of immune and targeted therapies into the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has significantly improved outcomes, reduced the intensity and duration of chemotherapy, and the reliance on allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). In younger patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative ALL, treatment with Hyper-CVAD and blinatumomab +/- inotuzumab has improved the 3-year overall survival (OS) to above 85%. In older patients, using less intensive chemotherapy (mini-Hyper-CVD) in combination with inotuzumab and blinatumomab has improved the 5-year OS rate to 50%. In Ph",0
"Feature selection is a crucial step in improving classification performance for high dimensional cancer datasets, which often contain numerous irrelevant or redundant features that can negatively impact model accuracy and increase computational load. The proposed hybrid AOA-SVM method effectively reduces the gene pool to a subset of highly informative features by implementing AOA's capability for efficient local optimization and diversity maintenance. Within the AOA framework, gene selection is refined through local optimization within smaller subgroups, followed by a shuffling phase to preserve solution diversity. This dual-phase strategy allows the identification of key genes that optimally distinguish between cancerous and healthy tissues. Selected gene subsets are then classified using SVM for high accuracy. The approach was evaluated on three major cancer datasets: leukaemia (AML, ALL), ovarian, and CNS. The method demonstrated impressive performance across all datasets. In the ovarian dataset, the model achieved 99.12 % accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 98.83 % with only 15 selected genes. The leukaemia dataset achieved perfect classification with 100 % accuracy and an AUC-ROC score with 34 genes. For the CNS dataset, the approach maintained 100 % accuracy using 43 genes. These results validate the AOASVM method's effectiveness in producing accurate, informative gene subsets, enabling high-precision classification. The AOA-SVM hybrid presents a highly accurate and computationally efficient tool for cancer diagnostics, demonstrating significant potential for application in precision medicine by identifying minimal, biologically relevant gene markers.",0
"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is a CD22-directed antibody conjugated with calicheamicin. The phase IB of the ITCC-059 trial tested InO combined with chemotherapy in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Relapsed /refractory CD22+ BCP-ALL pediatric patients were enrolled. The primary objective was to establish the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary objectives included preliminary efficacy and tolerability. InO was combined with 1.5 mg/m2 of vincristine (days 3, 10, 17, 24), 20 mg/m2 of dexamethasone (2 5-day blocks, then amended), and intrathecal therapy. A rolling-6 design was used testing InO from 0.8 to 1.8 mg/m2/cycle. Between May 2020 and April 2022, 30 patients were treated, and 29 were evaluable for dose limiting toxicities (DLT). At 1.1 mg/m2/cycle, two of four patients had DLT (liver toxicity). InO was de-escalated to 0.8 mg/m2/cycle (N=6) without DLT while awaiting a protocol amendment to reduce dexamethasone dose to 10 mg/m2. Post amendment, InO was re-escalated to 1.1 mg/m2/cycle (N=6, 1 DLT), then to 1.4 mg/m2/ cycle (N=3, no DLT), and finally to 1.8 mg/m2/cycle (N=7, 1 DLT). Three additional patients were treated in an expansion cohort. The pooled response rate was 80% (24/30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.4-92.3) and, among responders, 66.7% achieved minimal residual disease negativity. The RP2D of InO combined with vincristine, dexamethasone and intrathecal therapy was declared at 1.8 mg/m2/cycle (1.5 mg/m2/cycle after remission) in a fractioned schedule. This combination showed a response rate similar to the single agent cohorts of this trial, with liver toxicity issues at the initial higher dexamethasone dose (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: NTR5736).",0
"The chemical composition of the largely used tea from lemon verbena, Aloysia triphylla, was investigated. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the main aromatic and polyphenolic constituents of tea made by infusion from leaves were examined. The results showed that the relative proportions of the active constituents differ from those of the original leaves. The tea contained a large amount of polyphenolic compounds (mean value 675 mg/l; extraction yield 65%) including verbascoside (400 mg/l) and luteolin 7-diglucuronide (100 mg/l). It contained also 42 mg/l of essential oil (extraction yield 51%) with much more citral (77% of the essential oil) than the original leaves (41%).",1
"Water-extractable arabinoxylans from wheat and rye flour, dough and bread were isolated and characterised by the determination of the carbohydrate composition and the ferulic acid and diferulic acid contents. For both wheat and rye, the yield of water-extractable arabinoxylans decreased during the breadmaking process, indicating that some of the water-extractable arabinoxylans had become water-insoluble, possibly by the formation of ferulic acid–protein cross-links. The determination of ferulic acid and diferulic acids showed a low degree of dimerisation (less than 1%), which did not increase during the breadmaking process. Separation of the water-extractable arabinoxylans by size-exclusion chromatography showed that the molecular mass distribution of the arabinoxylans changed during breadmaking for both wheat and rye. Dual detection by measurement of the refractive index and the UV absorbance at 310 nm enabled screening for ferulic acid in the molecular mass fractions. Water-extractable arabinoxylans from wheat contained a medium molecular mass fraction which was not UV-active. The determination of ferulic acid in this fraction showed that it was free of ferulic acid.",1
"From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.",1
"Conditioning regimens employed in autologous stem cell transplantation have been proven useful in various hematological disorders and underlying malig nancies; however, despite being efficacious in various instances, negative consequences have also been recorded. Multiple conditioning regimens were extracted from various literature searches from databases like PubMed, Google scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane. Conditioning regimens for each disease were compared by using various end points such as overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and leukemia free survival (LFS). Variables were presented on graphs and analyzed to conclude a more efficacious conditioning regimen. In multiple myeloma, the most effective regimen was high dose melphalan (MEL) given at a dose of 200/mg/m",0
"Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.",1
"Because consumption of teas may be associated with potential health benefits due to its content in polyphenols and in Western countries the consumption of tea is equally divided between the hot and the ready-to-drink (RTD) cold versions of this typical beverage, the aim of this work was to study the absorption and metabolism of flavan-3-ols in human volunteers after the ingestion of a commercial RTD tea.",1
"A new colourimetric assay (based upon the reaction of their A-rings with the chromogen p-dimethylaminocinna-maldehyde) has been developed for flavanoids in beer. The flavanoid content for 19 different Belgian Pilsner beers by this method varied between 4·8 and 39·5 mg/litre with a mean of 26·3 mg/litre. These results were compared with the analytical data for total polyphenolics (EBC, Singleton), anthocyanogens (Jerumanis), and flavanoids (vanillin procedure). Good correlations existed between the results by the new method and the analytical data for total polyphenolics (EBC) and anthocyanogens (Jerumanis). Analysis by the new assay requires only one reagent and it is clear from the analytical data that the method is highly reproducible and sensitive",1
"Patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) are considered to have worse outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) than patients with other hematological malignancies, owing to high risk of relapse and immunocompromised status. However, no studies have compared transplant outcomes between patients with ATL and those with other hematological malignancies using a large-scale database. To compare transplant outcomes between patients with ATL and those with other leukemias and to identify factors contributing to worse transplant outcomes in ATL patients. Using Japanese registry data, we retrospectively compared transplant outcomes between patients with ATL and those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). As ATL often develops in patients in their 60s or older, patients with ATL, AML, or ALL aged ≥50 years were included in order to compare patients in the same age group. A total of 7764 patients (ATL, n = 1151; AML, n = 5393; ALL, n = 1220) who underwent their first allo-HSCT between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2017 were included in this study. Compared with AML, ATL showed significantly worse overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 1.34; P < .001) and higher risk of relapse (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.47; P < .001), while there were no significant differences between AML and ALL. Among patients in complete remission (CR) at transplantation, ATL showed worse OS (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.56; P = .006), higher risk of relapse (HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.14; P < .001), and higher risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.33; P = .001) in comparison with AML, whereas there were no significant differences between AML and ALL. We found that ATL patients have poor transplant outcomes compared with AML or ALL patients. In ATL patients, survival is poor, relapse is more frequent, and NRM is significantly higher, especially in cases of CR. These findings suggest that prevention of relapse and transplant-related complications is important for successful allo-HSCT in ATL.",0
"Human subjects drank coffee containing 412 mumol of chlorogenic acids, and plasma and urine were collected 0 to 24 h after ingestion and were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within 1 h, some of the components in the coffee reached nanomole peak plasma concentrations (C(max)), whereas chlorogenic acid metabolites, including caffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and sulfates of 3- and 4-caffeoylquinic acid lactones, had higher C(max) values. The short time to reach C(max) (T(max)) indicates absorption of these compounds in the small intestine. In contrast, dihydroferulic acid, its 4-O-sulfate, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate exhibited much higher C(max) values (145-385 nM) with T(max) values in excess of 4 h, indicating absorption in the large intestine and the probable involvement of catabolism by colonic bacteria. These three compounds, along with ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and dihydroferulic acid-4-O-glucuronide, were also major components to be excreted in urine (8.4-37.1 mumol) after coffee intake. Feruloylglycine, which is not detected in plasma, was also a major urinary component (20.7 mumol excreted). Other compounds, not accumulating in plasma but excreted in smaller quantities, included the 3-O-sulfate and 3-O-glucuronide of isoferulic acid, dihydro(iso)ferulic acid-3-O-glucuronide, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-glucuronide. Overall, the 119.9 mumol excretion of the chlorogenic acid metabolites corresponded to 29.1% of intake, indicating that as well as being subject to extensive metabolism, chlorogenic acids in coffee are well absorbed. Pathways for the formation of the various metabolites within the body are proposed. Urinary dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and feruloylglycine are potentially very sensitive biomarkers for the consumption of relatively small amounts of coffee.",1
"Phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds together with carotenoids, tocopherols, pigments, and fatty acids were tested for their antioxidant effect in 79 samples of virgin olive oils cv. Picual and Hojiblanca. A linear regression based on the oleic/linoleic ratio and the contents of phenols and tocopherols showed a good correlation (adjusted-R(2) = 0.91) with the stability measured by Rancimat, later verified with an external text set (adjusted-R(2) = 0.95). A tentative study on the percentage contribution of each chemical variable to stability is discussed. The contribution of phenolic and orthodiphenolic compounds was around 51%, the composition of fatty acids 24%, and in less percentage alpha-tocopherol, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. No effect, or very little, was shown by beta- and gamma-tocopherols.",1
"The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.",1
"Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases, is implicated in the pathogenesis of almost all types of leukemia via T cells activation and signal transduction. LCK is highly expressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and knockdown of the LCK gene can significantly inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cell lines. Here, we designed and synthesized a series of benzothiazole derivatives as novel LCK inhibitors using both docking-based virtual screening and activity assays for structural optimization. Among these compounds, 7 m showed a strong inhibitory activity in the proliferation of leukemia cell lines and LCK kinase activity. Moreover, we found that compound 7 m could induce apoptosis while simultaneously blocking cell cycle via decreasing its phosphorylation at Tyr394 of the LCK. Collectively, these findings shed new light on compound 7 m that would be utilized as a promising drug candidate with apoptosis-triggered and cell cycle arrest activities for the future ALL therapy.",0
"The possibility of proving the undeclared addition of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint and sensory evaluation. The cheaper pumpkin admixtures in apricot nectars and jams could not be detected by the sensory evaluation, particularly if present in quantities of <15%. The lower admixtures of pumpkin puree in apricot nectars and jams could be detected by the presence of syringic acid, a phenolic compound characteristic of the investigated pumpkins (Cucurbita pepo cv. Gleisdorff and Table Gold, Cucurbita maxima cv. Turkinja, and Cucurbita moschata cv. Argenta). Syringic acid was isolated from pumpkin puree and determined by using HPLC with diode array detection. By using the phenolic profile, undeclared pumpkin admixture (> or =5%) in the apricot nectars and jams could be proven.",1
"The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.",1
"Cytomegalovirus reactivation (CMV-R) is a frequent complication post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), associated with poor outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated the protective effect of CMV-R against relapse after allo-HSCT for acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). However, this impact remains unclear in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We conducted a retrospective study on 81 patients with ALL who received allo-HSCT after myeloablative conditioning regimen from matched sibling donors between 2016 and 2022. All patients underwent weekly monitoring for CMV-R by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay from engraftment until day +100 post allo-HSCT, and received antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir from day +1 to 6 months after allo-HSCT. Preemptive treatment was initiated when a viremia was higher than 150 copies/mL. The median age was 20 years (range, 5-50 years). After allo-HSCT, 35% of patients developed CMV-R after a median of 39 days (range, 19-100 days). After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 1-93 months), CMV-R was an independent factor associated with lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (OR: 0.17; 95% CI [0.03 - 0.98], p = 0.04) without survival benefit. Further studies are needed to validate the protective effect of CMV-R on ALL relapse.",0
"Total body irradiation (TBI) has been considered the myeloablative standard for fit adults undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the only randomized phase III recently reported no benefit of TBI in adult patients. This report aims to investigate the role of TBI in patients from a large European database. This European multicenter retrospective study included 3575 adults with ALL (1979-2019) in the SFGM-TC registry who received myeloablative conditioning before HSCT: 3,166 TBI-based and 409 CT-only. Primary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse incidence (RI), and non-relapse mortality (NRM). Competing-risks and Cox models were applied. Prespecified subgroup analyses included a favorable cohort (CR1, age ≤40 y, 2010-2019) with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). With a median follow-up of 71 months, all efficacy outcomes were improved with TBI-based conditioning. The 5-year OS, PFS, RI and NRM were 67.9% vs. 55.5%, (p = 0.0002), 62.5% vs 46.9% (p < 0.0001), 37.5% vs. 53.1% (p < 0.0001) and 32.6% vs 33.4% (p=0.32) in TBI and the CT-alone groups, respectively. In multivariable analyses, TBI independently improved OS (HR 0.61), PFS (HR 0.61) and RI (HR 0.61). In the favorable subgroup (CR1, ≤40 y, 2010-2019; n = 496), IPTW‑adjusted OS (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.44-1.31; p = 0.317) and PFS (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45-1.17; p = 0.187) were similar between regimens; 5‑yr relapse was lower with TBI (20.3% vs 46.6%; cause‑specific HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.36-1.15; p = 0.135), with comparable 5‑yr NRM (10.3% vs 10.4%; HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.41-2.65; p = 0.925). In this multicenter registry, TBI-based myeloablative conditioning was associated with lower relapse and improved OS/PFS versus CT-only, with similar NRM. In a contemporary favorable subgroup (CR1, ≤40 y, 2010-2019), survival rates were comparable, with relapse numerically lower after TBI. Randomized trials are needed to define who benefits most.",0
"After-cooking blackening (ACB) in potato cultivars results from the formation of complex compounds of chlorogenic acid and iron ions. At present the estimation of chlorogenic acid content represents the most reliable method for predicting the extent of ACB in material in a potato breeding programme to allow subsequent selection. A number of methods for determining chlorogenic acid levels, including high performance liquid chromatography, sodium nitrite and other colorimetric and chromatographic assays, are evaluated. A rapid screening method for the direct determination of chlorogenic acid levels is described, and its application within a breeding programme and the results obtained from a number of cultivars are discussed.",1
"York cabbage was blanched between 80 and 100°C with an increment of 5°C for up to 14min and kinetics of the different physicochemical properties were studied. Significant reductions in the texture, colour, polyphenols (PPs) and antioxidant (AO) capacity were observed due to blanching. Total phenolic and flavonoid content retained ranged from 19.6–24.5% to 22.0–25.7%, respectively. Heavy losses in the AO capacity of 74.0–82.0% also occurred as a result of blanching. Blanching caused a significant reduction in firmness of 24.0–73.2% and a similar trend was also observed for colour. Kinetic evaluation of degradation was carried out for all the studied quality parameters. The fractional conversion first-order reaction model showed a good fit for the different studied parameters, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.892 to 0.992, except for texture and colour, which followed first order and zero order kinetics, respectively. The temperature effect followed the Arrhenius law, with activation energies for polyphenolic content, AO capacity, colour and texture calculated as 9.22–11.5, 9.05–35.05, 15.73 and 33.8kJ/molK, respectively.",1
"The content of 9 types of isoflavonoids (daidzein, glycitein, genistein, formononetin, biochanin A, coumestrol, daidzin, glycitin and genistin) in 34 domestic or imported raw beans including soybeans, 7 immature beans and 5 bean sprouts consumed in Japan were systematically analyzed. Each isoflavonoid was analyzed in total after acid hydrolysis to the aglycone, and intact individual isoflavonoids were also analyzed without hydrolysis. After the sample clean up, daidzein, glycitein, genistein, formononetin, biochanin A, daidzin, glycitin and genistin were determined by HPLC with a diode array detector and coumestrol was determined by spectrofluorimetry. The content and composition of isoflavonoids varied greatly between soybean sprouts, immature soybeans and mature beans of the same type but of different source. Isoflavonoid content was highest in mature soybeans. The composition of isoflavonoids differed in each growth stage of soybeans. In other beans, the largest content of isoflavonoids was found in mature chickpeas, but this value was less than 1/27 of the isoflavonoid content in mature soybeans. Thus, the contribution of beans other than soybeans to the daily intake of isoflavonoids in a Japanese diet is negligible.",1
"Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close to 80 and 30%, respectively.",1
"The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the physicochemical, nutritional and microbial quality of acidified Granny Smith (GS) apple purée processed on industrial-scale high pressure system during 3 weeks of refrigerated storage (5 °C ± 1 °C). Two commercially feasible pressure treatments (400 and 600 MPa/5 min/20 °C) and a mild conventional pasteurization at 75 °C/10 min, with pasteurization values of P70°C7.5 = 8.15 min, were conducted and their effect on total vitamin C (total Vit C), ascorbic acid (AA) and total phenolic content (TPP), and on instrumental quality parameters (color, viscosity, soluble solids, titratable acidity and pH) were comparatively studied. Inactivation of indigenous microorganisms (total aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts and moulds and yeasts) of the apple product was also studied and monitored during storage. Total Vit C and AA contents were unaffected by the 400 MPa and the mild pasteurization treatment. TPP content was not changed during processing at 400 MPa, but was affected by the 600 MPa and also slightly by the pasteurization treatment. Experimental data on the loss of total Vit C during storage were described with a first-order reaction kinetic and times of half loss between 9.3 to 10.3 days could be estimated for the three studied processes. Storage provoked loss of TPP content and color deterioration of pressurized GS puree samples, which was attributed to enzymatic browning reactions. Microbial counts were reduced by the different preservation techniques below the detection limit (50 cfu g−1) and storage revealed no further growth.",1
"Policies to maximize peak bone mass in survivor's children of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been recognized as a priority area for research. The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship between osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL) axis, vitamin D status, and serum magnesium in ALL survivors. Sixty ALL survivors treated with chemotherapy and 60 age and sex-matched controls were included. Vitamin D and parathyroid hormone, RANK, RANKL, and OPG levels were immunoassayed, in addition to serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium levels, and alkaline phosphatase activity assessment. Furthermore, standard anthropometric measurement, history of fractures since treatment and clinical assessment were recorded. History of bone fractures after the start of therapy was detected in 17 ALL subjects (28.33%). Significantly lower vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, and OPG levels, meanwhile, significantly higher serum parathyroid hormone, RANK, and RANKL levels were detected in survivors compared with the control group. Vitamin D level was significantly positively correlated with magnesium, calcium, and OPG levels. Meanwhile, negatively correlated with RANK and RANKL levels. ALL survivors had a high prevalence of impaired vitamin D status, decreased Mg, and altered OPG/RANK/RANKL axis with impaired bone remodeling. The results herein may open the door for new interventional actions in ALL survivors to protect against bone resorption.",0
"In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and technique used.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has been confirmed improving remission rates in refractory patients or relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL). However, the added benefits of undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) following CAR-T therapy remain a subject of debate. In this research we investigated the efficiency and long-term outcomes of CD19 CAR-T bridging with allo-HSCT in R/R B-ALL patients. A total of 42 patients were brought into the cohort studies. Our findings revealed that patients who appected CAR-T followed by HSCT had a 1-year overall survival (OS) rate of 70 % and a 1-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate of 95 %. Moreover, patients who underwent this combined treatment had higher OS and LFS rates compared to those who received CAR-T therapy alone. In conclusion, the results of this clinical trial provide compelling evidence for the safety and efficacy of using CAR-T therapy as a bridging strategy to allo-HSCT in patients with R/R B-ALL.",0
"The difference in the distribution of sesamin, sesamolin, sesaminol glucosides and sesamolinol components in representative varieties of sesame were compared. Quantitation was achieved by HPLC determination using an external standard. The most abundant lignan glucosides in sesame seed were sesaminol triglucoside. The content of sesaminol triglucoside in 100 g seeds ranged from 14.1 to 91.3 mg with an average value of 68.4 mg; that of sesaminol diglucoside from 8.2 to 18.3 mg with an average value of 11.6 mg; and that of sesaminol monoglucoside from 5.4 to 19.5 mg with an average value of 8.3 mg. The total content of sesaminol glucoside was 88.3 mg in 100 g of sesame seeds. Also, the sesamolinol content in 100 g sesame seed ranged from 17.6 to 28.5 mg, the average being 20.5 mg. ",1
"Blood was collected from six human volunteers 1 h after the ingestion of lightly fried red onions, which are rich in anthocyanins and flavonols. Urine excreted 0-4 h after ingestion was also collected. Plasma and urine were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC with photodiode array and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Twenty-three flavonols as a range of mixed sulphate, methyl, glucuronide and glucoside derivatives of quercetin were detected. The availability of reference compounds facilitated the identification of quercetin-3-glucuronide. quercetin-3'-glucuronide, quercetin-4'-glucuronide, quercetin-3'-sulphate and isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide in samples from all volunteers. Samples from one volunteer also contained trace amounts of quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-glucoside and the aglycone quercetin. Despite a high dosage, neither anthocyanins nor anthocyanin metabolites accumulated in either plasma or urine in detectable quantities.",1
"Various measures have assessed social connection in long-term care (LTC) home residents. However, they use inconsistent terminology, conceptualizations, and operationalizations of social connection. In this systematic review protocol, we propose a study that will characterize measures that assess aspects of LTC home residents' social connection using a unified conceptual model. The objectives are to (1) describe and analyze the measures and (2) evaluate their measurement properties. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE ALL (Ovid), Embase Classic and Embase (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid), APA PsycInfo (Ovid), Scopus, CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost), AgeLine (EBSCOhost), and Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest). We will include primary research papers with no language limit, published from database inception. We will include studies of a measure of any aspect of social connection in LTC home residents that report at least one measurement property. Independently, two reviewers will screen titles and abstracts, review full-text articles against eligibility criteria, and extract data from included studies. In objective 1, we will analyze identified tools using an adapted framework method. In objective 2, we will evaluate each measure's measurement properties using COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) methodology. We will engage experts and stakeholders to assist with interpreting results and translating knowledge. Our findings will inform the social connection in long-term care home residents (SONNET) study's development of a novel, person-centered measure for social connection in LTC home settings. We will present our findings in academic and non-academic forums, including conferences, peer-reviewed journals, and other publications.

"A method based on high performance gelfiltration chromatograph), using a TSK 3000-S W column, was developed for the simultaneous determination of total chlorogenic acid and caffeine in coffee samples. The method presented good linearities and recoveries Jbr both compounds. Comparison with results obtained by reversed phase chromatography for caffeine and by the A OA C procedure and an adapted reversed phase chromatographic method .]'or chlorogenic acid showed good correlations between the proposed method and the reversed phase procedures (0'997for caffeine and 0'998for chlorogenic acid). The A OA C results for chlorogenic acid showed systematically higher values than the proposed method. The proposed method gave a C V(%) of 6.5 for caffeine and 5'O for chlorogenic acid and is adequate when applied to the analysis of different samples of green, roasted decaffeinated and instant coffees.",1
The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phytochemical profile and the antioxidant activity of strawberry fruit (cv. Camarosa) upon postharvest ripening at room temperature (20 °C) and to correlate them with qualitative attributes.,1
"In order to investigate the anthocyanin content and ascertain whether anthocyanins account for antioxidant activity in grape berry extracts, six prevalent anthocyanins were determined in 13 Hellenic native and four of the so-called “international” varieties widely cultivated in Greece. Anthocyanin content varied from 85.7 to 1914.0mgkg−1 fresh berry weight, the mean being 731.7mgkg−1. Assessment of the antiradical activity of extracts using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl radical revealed a low and statistically insignificant correlation (r2=0.0724, P>0.05) with total anthocyanin content, suggesting that other constituents are likely to exert strong antioxidant effects in grapes.",1
"We established a method for using HPLC and diode-array ultraviolet scanning to quantitate soy isoflavonoids in foods and in human plasma, urine, and breast milk. The analytes occurring as glycoside conjugates were hydrolyzed enzymatically before HPLC analysis if extracted from biological matrices or were subjected to direct HPLC analysis after extraction from foods. We monitored the isoflavones daidzein, genistein, glycitein, formononetin, and biochanin-A and their mammalian metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin in human plasma, urine, and breast milk. Analytes were identified by absorbance patterns, fluorometric and electrochemical detection. and comparison with internal and external standards. In addition, we identified analytes by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after trimethylsilylation. The HPLC method was also used to measure concentrations of isoflavones and their glucoside conjugates in various soy-based infant formulas. Total isoflavone concentrations varied between 155 and 281 mg/kg. After one woman received a moderate challenge with 20 g roasted soybeans (equivalent to 37 mg isoflavones), we detected mean total isoflavone concentrations of approximately 2.0 micromol/L in plasma, 0.2 micromol/L in breast milk, and 3.0 micromol/h in urine. According to our measurements, with adjustment for body weight, isoflavonoid exposure is 4-6 times higher in infants fed soy-based formula than in adults eating a diet rich in soyfoods (approximately 30 g/d). Implications of the presented results for the potential cancer-preventing activity of isoflavones by exposing newborn infants to these phytochemicals are discussed.",1
"Spices belonging to the Labiatae family were used to develop assays for evaluation of antioxidative activity of spices and spice extracts. Two different principles for detection of antioxidative activity were used: (i) an ESR spin trapping technique in which hydroxyl radicals were generated by the Fenton reaction and trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) in competition with spice extract constituents, (ii) electrochemical measurement of oxygen depletion rate in a heterogeneous lipid/water emulsion with lipid oxidation initiated by metmyoglobin. The ESR free radical method relates to the effect of antioxidant on the initiation of oxidation, while the oxygen depletion method relates to the effect of antioxidant on the propagation of oxidation. For both methods, marjoram and basil showed the lowest activity, while winter savory showed the highest activity as measured by the ESR method, and Turkish oregano and Chilean oregano showed the highest activity as measured by the oxygen depletion method. Total phenol content in the extract correlates linearly with the antioxidant activity as measured by oxygen depletion, but not with the free radical scavenging effect. It is concluded that extracts of the investigated spices contain components with at least two different antioxidative mechanisms.",1
"There is an urgent need to find targeted agents for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). NOTCH1 is the most frequently mutated oncogene in T-ALL, but clinical trials showed that pan-Notch inhibitors caused dose-limiting toxicities. Thus, we shifted our focus to ETS1, which is one of the transcription factors that most frequently co-bind Notch-occupied regulatory elements in the T-ALL context. To identify the most essential enhancers, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen of the strongest ETS1-dependent regulatory elements. The #1-ranked element is located in an intron of AHI1 that interacts with the MYB promoter and is amplified with MYB in ~8.5% of T-ALL patients. Using mouse models, we showed that this enhancer promotes self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and T-cell leukemogenesis, maintains early T-cell precursors, and restrains myeloid expansion with aging. We named this enhancer the hematopoietic stem cell MYB enhancer (H-Me). The H-Me shows limited activity and function in committed T-cell progenitors but is accessed during leukemogenesis. In one T-ALL context, ETS1 binds the ETS motif in the H-Me to recruit cBAF to promote chromatin accessibility and activation. ETS1 or cBAF degraders impaired H-Me function. Thus, we identified a targetable stem cell element that is co-opted for T-cell transformation.",0
"Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body's defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.",0
"Juvenile ossifying fibromas (JOF) are rare benign tumors affecting the craniofacial area, and they present more in younger age groups. JOFs are aggressive lesions and have a high tendency for recurring after surgical resection. A 9-years-old female who was a known case of major histocompatibility complex class II deficiency since birth and post hematopoietic stem cell transplant was diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Right anterior ethmoidal sinus opacification with mucosal thickening found on sinus imaging was initially thought to be infectious in origin due to the patient's immunodeficiency. However, further investigation and endoscopic sinus surgery with lesion debridement and biopsy revealed psammomatoid JOF. Follow up and imaging results urged the need for a second surgery, but no recurrence was detected. As the patient's ALL was being treated, the case was followed up for two months with imaging showing opacification in multiple sinuses which was suspected to be fungal infection due to immunodeficiency. The complicated character of the case may have hindered any additional invasive management. Opacification persisted despite conservative management. Unfortunately, the patient suffered from disease complication, infections, and died from multi-organ failure. This case highlights the importance of a thorough diagnostic workup and management strategy for immunodeficient patients with JOF. JOF's recurrent nature along with the pre-existing immunodeficiency made this case difficult to manage as the patient had other life-threatening condition. Specific management considerations should take place in immunocompromised patients. Post-operative long-term follow-ups are needed for early detection of recurrence.",0
"The modern treatment protocols in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) are based on the disease's genetic characteristics and response to treatment. We propose a novel five-probe FISH strategy to risk stratify the BCP-ALL and compare its ability with the triple trisomy probe strategy to detect high hyperdiploidy. All newly diagnosed BCP-ALL cases were investigated using a five-probe FISH panel that included probes targeting BCR::ABL1 fusion, ETV6::RUNX1 fusion, and break-apart probes for KMT2A, IgH, and CRLF2 rearrangements. Further, a selected number of cases were screened by the triple trisomy probe of 4p11/CEN10/17 (Zytovision, Bremerhaven, Germany) to identify aneuploidy. Of the 380 patients of BCP-ALL screened (≤ 18 years: 57.9%; > 18 years: 42.1%) using this five-probe strategy, we could assign clinically relevant eight risk groups to almost two-thirds of the patients (similar to the available literature). Compared with the widely accepted triple trisomy probe strategy, we found concordant findings in 75.5% of the patients; the triple trisomy probe could not identify high hyperdiploidy in 24.5% of patients. We observed the presence of (non-CRLF2) IgH rearrangement in 5.3% of patients. We conclude that the proposed five-probe FISH strategy is better equipped to more comprehensively risk stratify BCP-ALL patients, with an increased ability to identify high hyperdiploidy and a subset of Ph-like-BCP-ALL.",0
"High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and spectral data and literature references both suggested a 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to be readily differentiated.",1
"Total polyphenol content and in vitro antioxidant properties were investigated in five lager and three dark beers. The average concentration of total polyphenols in lager and dark beers was 376 and 473 mg l -1, respectively. All samples exhibited strong hydrogen-donating property and reducing power in a concentration-dependent manner. Beers also showed copper(II)-chelating ability and antioxidant property in Randox TAS measurement. The differences of polyphenol content and antioxidant characteristics between lager and dark beers were statistically not different. Antioxidant properties were dependent on the total polyphenol content of beers. The concentration of polyphenols and antioxidant properties except for chelating ability of beers measured in the same in vitro test system was very similar to those characteristics of white wine, while the extent of chelating ability of beers showed similarity to that of red wines. Studies evaluating the relative benefits of wine versus beer versus spirits suggest that moderate consumption of any alcoholic beverage is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease. Although beers have antioxidant capacity like white wines with having half the alcoholic content of wines, beers should be good sources of antioxidant polyphenols, and moderate consumption as a part of a well-balanced diet cannot be criticised either medically or socially and may have a beneficial effect on reducing oxidative disorders.",1
"The main flavonoids in grapefruit juice, naringin and narirutin, were quantified by LC-MS with structural differentiation by LC-MS/MS. After human consumption of grapefruit juice, urine samples were collected for 24 hours and screened for flavonoid metabolites by LC-MS. The metabolite structures (glucuronides, sulfates, and glucuronide sulfates) were then confirmed via their unique fragmentation patterns by LC-MS/MS. To further verify the identity of the common aglycon (naringenin) shared by the metabolites, enzymatic hydrolysis was performed and the resulting products were analyzed. This work demonstrates that LC-MS and LC-MS/MS techniques can be used for fast metabolite screening without extensive sample preparation.",1
"Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a refractory and recurrent subtype of B-cell ALL enriched with kinase-activating rearrangements. Incomplete understanding of the heterogeneity within the tumor cells presents a major challenge for the diagnosis and therapy of Ph-like ALL. Here, we exhibited a comprehensive cell atlas of one Ph-like ALL patient with a novel TPR-PDGFRB fusion gene at diagnosis and relapse by using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Twelve heterogeneous B-cell clusters, four with strong MKI67 expression indicating highly proliferating B cells, were identified. A relapse-enriched B-cell subset associated with poor prognosis was discovered, implicating the transcriptomic evolution during disease progression. Integrative single-cell analysis was performed on Ph-like ALL and Ph",0
"Philadelphia-like chromosome acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a new subtype of B-ALL that was discovered in 2009 and recognized in the 2016 revision of the World Health Organization criteria under the classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia. This new subtype has an extremely poor prognosis compared to that for other subtypes of ALL, with a 41% five-year overall survival (OS) rate. Ph-like ALL is chemoresistant, with a high minimum residual disease (MRD) level after induction therapy, and it is associated with a high relapse rate. Clinical trials are currently being conducted to study the effectiveness of specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors against different genetic alterations in Ph-like ALL patients and the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants (allo-HCT) on treatments. This review summarizes the current findings on Ph-like ALL, focusing on its molecular landscape and clinical implications.",0
"Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry (9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during storage.",1
"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is usually defined as the small number of cancer cells that remain in the body after treatment. The clinical significance of MRD kinetics is well recognized in treatment of hematologic malignancies, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Real time quantitative PCR targeting immunoglobulin (Ig) or T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement (PCR-MRD), as well as multiparametric flow cytometric analysis targeting antigen expression, are widely used in MRD detection. In this study, we devised an alternative method to detect MRD using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), targeting somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs). This ddPCR-based method (ddPCR-MRD) had sensitivity up to 1E-4. We assessed ddPCR-MRD at 26 time points from eight T-ALL patients, and compared it to the results of PCR-MRD. Almost all results were concordant between the two methods, but ddPCR-MRD detected micro-residual disease that was missed by PCR-MRD in one patient. We also measured MRD in stored ovarian tissue of four pediatric cancer patients, and detected 1E-2 of submicroscopic infiltration. Considering the universality of ddPCR-MRD, the methods can be used as a complement for not only ALL, but also other malignant diseases regardless of tumor-specific Ig/TCR or surface antigen patterns.",0
"Antioxidant activity (AA) of phenolic compounds in methanolic extract of Iranian caraway was compared with clove. Total phenolic content of caraway and clove extracts determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, were 13.76 and 243.91 mg g−1 dry matter respectively, expressed as tannic acid equivalents, and total flavonoid content of extracts were 2.6 and 5.0 mg g−1 dry matter, respectively, expressed as epicatechin equivalents. The extracts were screened for their potency as antioxidant using various in vitro models, such as β-carotene–linoleate, ferric thiocyanate, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydroxyl (DPPH) radical, hydroxyl radical (•OH) and reducing power model systems. AA of BHT was also determined in model systems. AA of methanolic extracts at different concentrations of total phenolic content according to β-carotene bleaching and ferric thiocyanate methods expressed as AA (per cent inhibition relative to control) ranged from 82% to 96%.The scavenging effect of both extracts on DPPH and •OH radicals were 23–40% and 3.5–12.7%, respectively, which were comparable with BHT as a synthetic antioxidant. Extracts with high content of total phenolic compounds exhibited also good reducing power.",1
"Recent studies have demonstrated the association between constitutional ring chromosome 21 (r(21)c) and the development of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21 (iAMP21). iAMP21 acts as a driver which is often accompanied by secondary alterations that influence disease progression. Here, we report an atypical case of iAMP21 B-ALL with a unique molecular profile in the context of r(21)c. The onset of B-ALL occurred significantly earlier than previously reported in iAMP21-ALL, likely due to the presence of r(21)c. Only scarce cases of iAMP21 with concomitant",0
"Procyanidins are major dietary polyphenols made of elementary flavan-3-ol (epi)catechin units. They have antioxidant properties and may contribute to health benefits in humans, but little is known about their metabolic fate. We compared here the metabolism of procyanidin dimer B3, trimer C2, and polymer isolated from willow tree catkins to that of catechin monomer in rats. These compounds were administered in the rat diet (0.1%, w/w) for 5 d and their metabolites estimated in 24 h urine. In rats fed procyanidins, neither parent compound nor catechin derivatives could be detected in contrast to animals fed catechin monomer, which excreted large amounts of catechin and its 3'-O-methylated form (25.7 +/- 0.6%). On the other hand, 16 metabolites of microbial origin were detected and identified as phenylvaleric, phenylpropionic, phenylacetic, and benzoic acid derivatives. Their total yields significantly decreased from the catechin monomer (10.6 +/- 1.1%) to the procyanidin dimer (6.5 +/- 0.2%), trimer (0.7 +/- 0.1%), and polymer (0.5 +/- 0.1%). Therefore, the degree of procyanidin polymerization has a major impact on their fate in the body characterized by a poor absorption through the gut barrier and a limited metabolism by the intestinal microflora as compared to catechin. This will have to be considered to explain the health effects of procyanidins. The contribution of their microbial metabolites should also be further investigated.",1
"Children living in upstream oil and natural gas (O&G) areas may be exposed to leukemogens and at increased risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We conducted a case-control study of children born in Colorado between 1992 and 2019. We matched 451 children diagnosed with ALL at ages 2 to 9 years starting in 2002 to 2,706 controls based on birth month/year and Hispanic ethnicity. We estimated upstream O&G activity intensities from conception through a 10-year latency using our intensity-adjusted inverse distance weighted (IA-IDW) model. We applied logistic regression models adjusted for confounders to evaluate associations between ALL and IA-IDW. For children within 5 km of an O&G well site, we observed a 62% [OR = 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.964-2.62], 84% (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35-2.48), and 100% (OR = 2.00; 95% CI, 1.14-3.37) increase in ALL risk for low, medium, and high IA-IDW groups, compared with the referent group. Within 13 km, we observed a 59% (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.03-2.37), 40% (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09-1.80), and 164% (OR = 2.64; 95% CI, 1.80-3.86) increase in ALL risk for low, medium, and high IA-IDW groups. Colorado's children living within 13 km of O&G well sites are at increased risk for ALL, with children within 5 km bearing the greatest risk. Current setbacks between O&G well sites and residences may not be sufficient to protect the health of these children. Our results can be applied to policies to reduce childhood leukemogen exposures.",0
"Movement efficiency, a measure of neuromuscular biomechanics, may be modified by physical activity. We aimed to assess the risk of and risk factors for low movement efficiency in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Participants underwent an assessment of activity energy expenditure (AEE) with actigraphy, and the gold standard doubly labeled water, where the differences between elimination rates of oxygen and hydrogen from body water are evaluated over a week. Movement efficiency was assessed using the raw residuals of a linear regression between AEEs from accelerometers and doubly labeled water. Elastic-net logistic regressions were used to identify demographic, treatment, and functional variables associated with movement efficiency. The study cohort included 256 non-cancer controls and 302 ALL survivors (48% female), categorized as efficient (N = 24), normal (N = 245), or inefficient (N = 33) based on their movement efficiency. There was no difference in the odds for poor movement efficiency between survivors (n = 33, 10.9%) compared to controls (n = 23, 9.0%, odds ratio [OR]: 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67, 2.10; p = 0.55). In survivors, neuropathy was associated with a higher risk of being inefficient compared to efficient (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.03-17.96), while obesity (≥ 30 kg/m Neuropathy was associated with a higher risk of poor movement efficiency in survivors of childhood ALL. These results further highlight impairments associated with treatment-induced neuropathy in survivors of childhood ALL.",0
"The posttransplant relapse in Ph-positive ALL increases the risk of death. There is an unmet need for instruments to predict the risk of relapse and plan prophylaxis. In this study, we analyzed posttransplant data by machine learning algorithms. Seventy-four Ph-positive ALL patients with a median age of 30 (range 18-55) years who previously underwent allo-HSCT, were retrospectively enrolled. Ninety-three percent of patients received prophylactic/preemptive TKIs after allo-HSCT. The values of the BCR::ABL1 level at serial assessments and over variables were collected in specified intervals after allo-HSCT. They were used to model relapse risk with several machine-learning approaches. GBM proved superior to the other algorithms and provided a maximal AUC score of 0.91. BCR::ABL1 level before and after allo-HSCT, prediction moment, and chronic GvHD had the highest value in the model. It was shown that after Day + 100, both error rates do not exceed 22%, while before D + 100, the model fails to make accurate predictions. As a result, we determined BCR::ABL1 levels at which the relapse risk remains low. Thus, the current BCR::ABL1 level less than 0.06% in patients with chronic GvHD predicts low risk of relapse. At the same time, patients without chronic GVHD after allo-HSCT should be classified as high risk with any level of BCR::ABL1. GBM model with posttransplant laboratory values of BCR::ABL1 provides a high prediction of relapse after allo-HSCT in the era of TKIs prophylaxis. Validation of this approach is warranted.",0
"We retrospectively analyzed outcomes for nine children and young adults who were treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) for relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) after CD19-chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CART). After InO cycle 1, overall response rate was 77.8%; 66.7% achieved measurable residual disease (MRD)-negative remission. One-year event-free survival (EFS) was 37.5%; 1-year overall survival (OS) was 50%; 2-year EFS was 37.5%; 2-year OS was 37.5%. Median survivor follow-up is 2.9 years (0.5-4.7). Significant adverse events included prolonged cytopenias, hepatotoxicity, and post-transplant sinusoidal obstructive sydrome. InO showed promising efficacy as treatment for children and young adults with R/R B-ALL after CD19-CART. Extramedullary disease prior to InO and positive MRD after InO cycle 1 were associated with poor outcomes.",0
"This study aimed to elucidate the metabolic profile and safety of Bopu Powder in laying hens, focusing on its principal alkaloids protopine (PRO) and allocryptopine (ALL). Nine hens received intravenous PRO (1 mg/kg·bw), ALL (1 mg/kg·bw), or saline. Blood (5-120 min post-dose) and feces (48 h collection) were analyzed via LC-Q-TOF-MS, revealing 9 ALL and 12 PRO metabolites, including two novel structures. In a separate 56-day trial, 324 hens were assigned to control, 50 mg/kg Bopu Powder (BP), or 500 mg/kg Bopu Powder (BPX) groups. Post-trial analyses showed PRO and ALL residues primarily in their kidneys (BP: PRO 11.21 ng/g, ALL 6.59 ng/g; BPX: PRO 23.62 ng/g, ALL 7.92 ng/g) and livers (BP: PRO 15.52 ng/g; BPX: PRO 269.49 ng/g, ALL 56.14 ng/g). Residues in eggs occurred exclusively in the BPX group (PRO 26.86 ng/g, ALL 12.29 ng/g). No residues were detected in other tissues (jejunum, ileum, ovaries, oviducts, uterus, muscle, fat, gizzard). Serum biochemical indicators and histopathological examinations were used to evaluate the long-term effects of Bopu Powder. The results confirmed that supplementation at doses up to 500 mg/kg did not induce any significant physiological or histopathological alterations.",0
"CD58 loss has been described as a mechanism of resistance to blinatumomab and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, functioning as a modulator of response to T-cell activation. Using flow cytometry, we evaluated the impact of CD58 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on the probability of achieving measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO). The odds ratio of achieving MRD negativity was 1.03 for every 1000 unit increase in CD58 MFI. Our results suggest that MRD negativity rates after InO are high, regardless of the intensity of CD58 expression.",0
"Fresh aerial parts of different chicory varieties: green chicory (c.v. ""Catalogna""), two red chicory varieties (""radicchio rosso di Chioggia"" and ""radicchio rosso di Treviso""), and Witloof or Belgian endive were analyzed by HPLC/DAD/MS. The chromatographic fingerprint was diagnostic for each variety. A monocaffeoyl tartaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and chicoric acid were detected in all the varieties, while cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside, and cyanidin 3-O-(6'' malonyl) glucoside were the main phenolic compounds in the red varieties. The flavonoidic compounds, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide, were absent in the Witloof sample. The phenolic compounds from total leaves were the same as those obtained from only the colored parts; nevertheless, the total amount was remarkably lower with a decrease of up to 80% for Belgian endive. Chemical stability at high temperature was observed for the phenolic fraction from the green variety after decoction at 100 degrees C for 30 min.",1
"Many nontraditional vegetable oils have been introduced to the market relatively recently, and therefore data on their antioxidant potential have not been reported. Such data are of importance for the evaluation of the nutritional and health impact of these oils. Antioxidant properties of the methanolic extracts of cold-pressed oils such as soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, corn, grapeseed, hemp, flax, rice bran and pumpkin were studied. The methanolic extracts were obtained by solid phase extraction and separation, and identification of phenolic acids was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography. The obtained extracts were characterized by different scavenging activities of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals. The best antioxidant properties were displayed by the extract from hemp, pumpkin and rapeseed oils. The highest content of total phenolic compounds was determined for the pumpkin and hemp oils – about 2.4 mg/100 g. Rapeseed oil was characterized by the highest content of phenolic acids, especially sinapic acid. To better understand the beneficial effects of antioxidant compounds in vegetable oils, it is important to investigate whether these bioactive compounds in oils differ in their reactions with free radicals.",1
"The prognosis of patients diagnosed with relapsed or refractory (R/R) T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) has consistently been unsatisfactory, with limited treatment options. As reports, the CAG regimen can serve as a salvage treatment for R/R T-ALL/LBL, but there remains a subset of patients who do not benefit from it. Recent studies have indicated that daratumumab (Dara) and venetoclax (Ven) may offer promising therapeutic benefits for T-ALL/LBL. In light of these findings, we conducted a safety and efficacy evaluation of the enhanced treatment regimen, combining Dara and Ven with aclarubicin, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and etoposide (CAGE), in patients suffering from R/R T-ALL/LBL. The participants in this phase I trial were patients with R/R T-ALL/LBL who fail to standard treatment regimens. During each 28-day cycle, the patients were treated by Dara, Ven, cytarabine, aclarubicin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, etoposide. The primary endpoint of this study was the rate of remission. This report presents the prospective outcomes of 21 patients who received the salvage therapy of Dara and Ven combined with the CAGE regimen (Dara + Ven + CAGE). The objective remission rate (ORR) was determined to be 57.1%, while the complete remission (CR) rate was 47.6%. Notably, patients with the early T-cell precursor (ETP) subtype exhibited a significantly higher remission rate in the bone marrow compared to non-ETP patients (100% vs. 44.4%, p = 0.044). The Dara + Ven + CAGE regimen demonstrated a favorable remission rate in patients with R/R T-ALL/LBL. Moreover, the treatment was well-tolerated.",0
"The flavonoid quercetin, or its metabolites, inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in rodents and may have a role in the prevention of human cancers. Quercetin exposure in human populations results from the dietary intake of various plant foods; high concentrations of quercetin are found in apples, onions, tea, and red wine. Determination of the relationship between dietary intake and cancer risk depends on the characterization of quercetin intake. The development and use of biomarkers for quercetin intake may provide a basis for the objective classification of this exposure. One possible biomarker is metabolic products of quercetin. We report the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assay for quantitation of quercetin metabolites in human urine. The metabolites include 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (homoprotocatechuic acid), metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (homovanillic acid). The assay has only two major steps, ether extraction and HPLC analysis, and is suitable for analysis of large sample numbers. Analytical characteristics of the assay include a sensitivity of less than 1 microgram, precision with coefficients of variation < 10%, and metabolite recoveries > 90%. The mean concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in two human urine samples are approximately 0.7, 4.8, and 2.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The identification of each metabolite is confirmed by HPLC, UV absorbance scans, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. These results verify the occurrence of quercetin metabolites in human urine and the feasibility of quercetin metabolite quantitation, by the assay described herein, for epidemiological studies. Development of the analytical procedure is an essential first step for validation of the metabolites as biomarkers of quercetin intake.",1
"The isoflavone aglycon and glucoconjugate content of commercially prepared and ""home-prepared"" high- and low-soy foods selected for use in an on-going nutritional study were measured by LC-MS. The daidzin, daidzein, 6""-O-malonyldaidzin, 6""-O-acetyldaidzin, genistein, genistin, 6""-O-malonylgenistin, 6""-O-acetylgenistin, glycitin, glycitein, 6""-O-malonylglycitin, and 6""-O-acetylglycitin content are expressed in terms of individual isoflavones, total isoflavone equivalents, and milligrams of isoflavones per portion served. Soybeans (774 mg x kg(-1) total isoflavones) and soybean-containing foods had the highest isoflavone content of the foods examined. The low-soy foods all contained very low concentrations (<8 mg x kg(-1) total isoflavones) of the isoflavone aglycons and glucoconjugates. High- and low-soy 11 day rotating menus were constructed from the analyzed foods to deliver 100.0 and 0.5 mg of isoflavones per day, respectively.",1
"This scoping review aims to map the existing research on adverse events during the delivery of telerehabilitation. Telerehabilitation, a subset of telemedicine, has gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to deliver rehabilitation services remotely. However, there exists a research gap as there has yet to be any scoping review, systematic review, or meta-analysis published to identify and summarize the current primary research on adverse events related to telerehabilitation as a whole. It is important to understand how adverse events, such as falls during physiotherapy or aspiration pneumonia during speech language pathology sessions, are associated with telerehabilitation delivery. This will help to identify key limitations for optimizing telerehabilitation delivery by allowing for the development of key risk-mitigation measures and quality indicators. It can also help improve the uptake of telerehabilitation among clinicians and patients. This review aims to fill this research gap by conducting a search of published literature on adverse events in telerehabilitation. Anticipated key findings of this scoping review include identifying the characteristics and frequencies of adverse events during telerehabilitation, the patient populations and types of telerehabilitation associated with the most adverse events, and the quality of reporting of adverse events. The review follows the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological framework and adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The review protocol has been registered and published on Open Science Framework. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented across multiple databases (MEDLINE ALL, EMBASE, APA PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and CINAHL). All stages (screening, extraction, and synthesis) will be conducted in duplicate and independently, with data extraction following the TIDieR framework, along with authors, year of publication (before or after COVID), population and sample size, and specific mode/s of telerehabilitation delivery. For synthesis, data will be summarized quantitatively using numerical counts and qualitatively via content analysis. The data will be grouped by intervention type and by type of adverse event. This scoping review will include qualitative and quantitative studies published between 2013 and 2023, written in English, and conducted in any geographic area. All modes of telerehabilitation delivery (asynchronous, synchronous, or hybrid) will be included. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, commentaries, protocols, opinion pieces, conference abstracts, and case series with fewer than five participants will be excluded.",0
"Asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) occurs in up to 18% of patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, long-term sequelae are largely unexplored. We aimed to explore pancreatic sequelae among ALL survivors with and without AAP. We investigated pancreatic sequelae in a national cohort of ALL survivors, aged 1-45 years at ALL diagnosis treated according to the NOPHO-ALL2008 protocol and included sex- and age-matched community controls. We included 368 survivors (median follow-up 6.9 years), including 47 survivors with AAP and 369 controls. The p-lipase and p-pancreas-type amylase levels were lower in AAP survivors compared with both non-AAP survivors (Medians: 23 U/L [IQR 14-32] and 18 U/L [IQR 10-25] versus 29 [IQR 24-35] and 22 [17-28], p < .001 and p = .002) and community controls (28 U/L [IQR 22-33] and 21 U/L [IQR 17-26], both p < .006). Fecal-elastase was more frequently reduced in AAP survivors compared with non-AAP survivors (7/31 vs. 4/144, p = .001). Persisting pancreatic sequelae were found in 15/47 of AAP survivors and 20/323 of non-AAP survivors (p < .001), including diabetes mellitus in 2/39 of AAP survivors and 2/273 of non-AAP survivors. ALL survivors with AAP are at increased risk of persisting pancreatic dysfunction and require special attention during follow-up.",0
"Whole rice has been widely studied due to the abundance of bioactive compounds in its pericarp. Some of the beneficial effects of these compounds on human health have been attributed to their antioxidant and other biological activities, such as enzyme inhibition. In this work, we evaluated the contents of total, soluble and insoluble phenolic compounds of 6 red and 10 non-pigmented genotypes of whole rice as well as their inhibitory effect on the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). The effects of cooking on phenolics and their inhibitory activities were also investigated. Red genotypes showed high content of phenolics, mainly soluble compounds, at an average of 409.7 mg ferulic acid eq./100 g, whereas overall lower average levels (99.4 mg ferulic acid eq./100 g) at an approximate soluble/insoluble compound ratio of 1:1 were observed in non-pigmented rice. Pigmented rice displayed a greater inhibitory effect on ACE than non-pigmented rice. In fact, a significant correlation between the content of soluble phenolics and ACE inhibition was observed (r = 0.8985, p < 0.05). In addition to significantly reducing the levels of total phenolics and ACE inhibition, cooking altered the soluble/insoluble compound ratio, especially among red rice genotypes.",1
"The optimization and validation of a protocol for the quantification of six dietary lignans, i.e., secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, medioresinol, and syringaresinol, in food are presented. The method incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease prevention.",1
"Acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a severe hematologic malignancy with limited treatment options and poor long-term survival. This study explores the role of IKZF1 in regulating BCL-2 expression in T-ALL. CUT&Tag and CUT&Run assays were employed to assess IKZF1 binding to the BCL-2 promoter. IKZF1 overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed in T-ALL cell lines. The effects of CX-4945 and venetoclax, alone and in combination, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo T-ALL models. CUT&Tag sequencing identified IKZF1 binding to the BCL-2 promoter, establishing it as a transcriptional repressor. Functional assays demonstrated that IKZF1 overexpression reduced BCL-2 mRNA levels and increased repressive histone marks at the BCL-2 promoter, while IKZF1 knockdown led to elevated BCL-2 expression. CX-4945, a CK2 inhibitor, could reduced BCL-2 levels in T-ALL cells. Notably, knockdown of IKZF1 partially rescued the CX-4945-induced repression of BCL-2. These results underscore the CK2-IKZF1 signaling axis as a key regulator of BCL-2 expression. In vitro, CX-4945 enhanced the cytotoxicity of venetoclax, with the combination showing significant synergistic effects and increased apoptosis in T-ALL cell lines. In vivo studies with cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models demonstrated that CX-4945 and venetoclax combined therapy provided superior therapeutic efficacy, reducing tumor burden and prolonging survival compared to single-agent treatments. IKZF1 represses BCL-2 in T-ALL, and targeting the CK2-IKZF1 axis with CX-4945 and venetoclax offers a promising therapeutic strategy, showing enhanced efficacy and potential as a novel treatment approach for T-ALL.",0
"Measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) is considered the single most powerful high-risk factor in acute leukemia, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In this study, we evaluated the impact of flow cytometry (FC)-based detection of MRD on survival outcomes in pediatrics, adolescents, and young adults (AYA) with T-ALL. We included 139 patients, 88 pediatric patients between the ages of one and 14 years, and 51 AYA patients between 15 and 39 years of age, over a period of three years and were treated with the Indian Collaborative Childhood Leukemia Group (ICiCLe) protocol. MRD assessment was performed on post-induction (PI) bone marrow aspirate samples using a 10-color 11-antibody MRD panel on a Gallios instrument (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). MRD value > 0.01% was considered positive. PI-MRD status was available in 131 patients. The five-year event-free survival (5-year EFS) in PI-MRD positive patients was inferior to those of negative patients (13.56% vs 79.06%), which was statistically significant (P < 0.001). However, the five-year overall survival (5-year OS) did not show any statistically significant difference between PI-MRD positive and negative T-ALL patients (92.93% vs 94.28%). The hazard ratio (HR) for 5-year EFS and MRD positivity was 8.03 (p-value < 0.0001). HR for 5-year EFS and early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) was 2.63 (p = -0.02). PI-MRD detected using FC is a strong predictive factor of inferior survival outcomes in pediatrics, AYA patients with T-ALL. PI-MRD positivity can be used to modify the treatment of T-ALL patients, especially in resource-constrained developing countries where molecular tests are not widely available.",0
"Clinically significant structural variation (SV), notably chromosomal translocation, results in the formation of fusion genes that drive leukaemogenesis. Detection of SVs is vital in clinical diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of haematological malignancies. Current methods for SV identification are low in sensitivity for cryptic cases and time-consuming for complex cases. This study investigated the feasibility of long read sequencing as an approach for SV detection and precise breakpoint characterization. Six archival samples, including 4 bone marrow blood samples (F/66 B-ALL, F/25 B-ALL, M/53 CML, F/34 B-ALL) and 1 cytogenetic cell pellet each in cell culture medium (M/52 CML) or Carnoy's fixative (M/44 CML) with known and previously characterized BCR::ABL1 fusion transcript were selected for study. The genomic DNA was extracted from each case for further breakpoint characterization by long read sequencing (MinION R9.4.1 flow cell, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). All the genomic breakpoints were concordant with the RNA fusion transcript breakpoints. Three typical (e1a2, e13a2, and e14a2) and 3 variant (e23a2Ins52, e8a2, and e13a2ins74) BCR breakpoints were identified. Using the Ph translocation as an example, long read sequencing is a promising alternative method to detect SV, revolutionizing detection of chromosomal translocation to a higher precision. A more comprehensive spectrum of SV can be resolved along with cytogenetic results, enabling precise diagnosis and personalized monitoring of haematological malignancies.",0
"Different driver mutations and/or chromosomal aberrations and dysregulated signaling interactions between leukemia cells and the immune microenvironment have been implicated in the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To better understand changes in the bone marrow microenvironment and signaling pathways in pediatric T-ALL, bone marrows collected at diagnosis (Dx) and end of induction therapy (EOI) from 11 patients at a single center were profiled by single cell transcriptomics (10 Dx, 5 paired EOI, 1 relapse). T-ALL blasts were identified by comparison with healthy bone marrow cells. T-ALL blast-associated gene signature included SOX4, STMN1, JUN, HES4, CDK6, ARMH1 among the most significantly overexpressed genes, some of which are associated with poor prognosis in children with T-ALL. Transcriptome profiles of the blast cells exhibited significant inter-patient heterogeneity. Post induction therapy expression profiles of the immune cells revealed significant changes. Residual blast cells in MRD+ EOI samples exhibited significant upregulation (P < 0.01) of PD-1 and RhoGDI signaling pathways. Differences in cellular communication were noted in the presence of residual disease in T cell and hematopoietic stem cell compartments in the bone marrow. Together, these studies generate new insights and expand our understanding of the bone marrow landscape in pediatric T-ALL.",0
"Cassia bark or cortex cinnamomi, the dried stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia Presl. (Lauraceae), is a popular natural spice and a commonly used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. However, adulterants are frequently found in the market. In this study, 44 samples of Cassia bark including bark from seven related Cinnamomum species were collected from fields and market. Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia. It is suggested that five characteristic peaks by HPLC are suitable for distinguishing genuine cassia bark from the adulterants and could be applied in the quality control of this commodity.",1
"The consumption of anthocyanins has been shown to prevent certain chronic diseases. However, anthocyanin metabolism has not yet been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to evaluate anthocyanin urinary excretion in humans receiving a meal containing blackberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Five healthy volunteers were fed 200 g of blackberries (960 mumol of anthocyanins). Urine samples were collected and rapidly treated by solid-phase extraction. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-vis detection, respectively. In addition to native cyanidin 3-glucoside, several other anthocyanin metabolites were identified in the urine: methylated glycosides, glucuronides of anthocyanidins and anthocyanins, a sulfoconjugate of cyanidin, and anthocyanidins. Total urinary excretion of blackberry anthocyanin metabolites was 0.160 +/- 0.020% (n = 5) of the amount of anthocyanins ingested. Monoglucuronides of anthocyanidins represented >60% of this excretion. Urinary excretion of anthocyanins was maximal between 2 and 4 h after the meal, but continued during the 24 h of the experiment. This study highlighted the influence of aglycon structure on anthocyanin urinary excretion. It demonstrated that anthocyanins are not only methylated but also glucuroconjugated and sulfoconjugated in humans and that the main metabolites of blackberry anthocyanins in human urine were anthocyanidin monoglucuronides.",1

"Thioguanine (TG), azathioprine (AZA), and mercaptopurine (MP) are thiopurine prodrugs commonly used to treat diseases, such as leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) have been commonly used for monitoring treatment. High levels of 6-TGNs in red blood cells (RBCs) have been associated with leukopenia, the cutoff levels that predict this side effect remain uncertain. Thiopurines are metabolized and incorporated into leukocyte DNA. Measuring levels of DNA-incorporated thioguanine (DNA-TG) may be a more suitable method for predicting clinical response and toxicities such as leukopenia. Unfortunately, most methodologies to assay 6-TGNs are unable to identify the impact of NUDT15 variants, effecting mostly ethnic populations (e.g., Chinese, Indian, Malay, Japanese, and Hispanics). DNA-TG tackles this problem by directly measuring thioguanine in the DNA, which can be influenced by both TPMT and NUDT15 variants. While RBC 6-TGN concentrations have traditionally been used to optimize thiopurine therapy due to their ease and affordability of measurement, recent developments in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) techniques have made measuring DNA-TG concentrations in lymphocytes accurate, reproducible, and affordable. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the current evidence of DNA-TG levels as marker for thiopurine therapy, especially with regards to NUDT15 variants. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the current evidence for DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy, including methods for measurement and the illustrative relationship between DNA-TG and various gene variants (such as TPMT, NUDT15, ITPA, NT5C2, and MRP4). PubMed and Embase were systematically searched up to April 2024 for published studies, using the keyword ""DNA-TG"" with MeSH terms and synonyms. The electronic search strategy was augmented by a manual examination of references cited in articles, recent reviews, editorials, and meta-analyses. A meta-analysis was performed using R studio 4.1.3. to investigate the difference between the coefficients (Fisher's z-transformed correlation coefficient) of DNA-TG and 6-TGNs levels. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan version 5.4 to investigate the difference in DNA-TG levels between patients with or without leukopenia using randomized effect size model. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottowa quality assessment scale. In this systematic review, 21 studies were included that measured DNA-TG levels in white blood cells for either patients with ALL (n = 16) or IBD (n = 5). In our meta-analysis, the overall mean difference between patients with leukopenia (ALL + IBD) versus no leukopenia was 134.15 fmol TG/µg DNA [95% confidence interval (CI) (83.78-184.35), P < 0.00001; heterogeneity chi squared of 5.62, I This systematic review strongly supports the further investigation of DNA-TG as a marker for monitoring thiopurine therapy. Its correlation with treatment outcomes, such as relapse-free survival in ALL and the risk of leukopenia in IBD, underscores its role in enhancing personalized treatment approaches. DNA-TG effectively identifies NUDT15 variants and predicts late leukopenia in patients with IBD, regardless of their NUDT15 variant status. The recommended threshold for late leukopenia prediction in patients with IBD with DNA-TG is suggested to be between 320 and 340 fmol/µg DNA. More clinical research on DNA-TG implementation is mandatory to improve patient care and to improve inclusivity in thiopurine treatment.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent pediatric cancer. 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) is a key component of ALL treatment. Its use, however, is also associated with adverse drug reactions, particularly myelosuppression. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and, more recently, Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) deficiency, due to no-function variants in their respective genes, are well known for their role in the development of this toxicity. Two novel genetic variants, rs12199316 in TPMT and rs73189762 in the NUDT15 gene, were recently identified by targeted sequencing. The latter is particularly interesting because of its potential association with 6-MP intolerance. Here, we assessed the relationship of this variant with the risk of myelosuppression and 6-MP dose intensity in 275 patients treated with Dana Farber Cancer Institute ALL protocols at the Sainte Justine University Health Center. Carriers of the NUDT15 rs73189762 variant allele were at a higher risk of myelosuppression, as shown by absolute phagocyte count reduction during consolidation II and maintenance phases of therapy. Reduction in 6-MP dose intensity was observed in patients with both rs73189762 and known no-function variants in the NUDT15 and TPMT genes. This finding supports the initial observation and suggests that 6-MP dose reduction might be beneficial for individuals with this genotype combination.",0
"Plant productivity, phenolic profile and natural fermentation, with and without lactic acid bacteria inoculants, were investigated in olive fruit of Ascolana tenera growing under different irrigation regimes. A rainfed control and two treatments receiving a water depth equivalent to 33 and 66% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from the pit hardening stage and a treatment with 66% of ETc during the entire season (25 May-4 October), were tested. Olive vigour increased with irrigation, which also induced a fresh yield enhancement, mainly due to the increase in fruit size. The differences between treatments were less evident for fruit number per tree and pulp/stone ratio. The phenolic content increased in water deficit-stressed olives and differences were detected in the concentrations of individual phenolic compounds. Olive oil content and fatty acids composition appeared scarcely affected by irrigation. Values of pH, acidity, sugars, phenolic composition and microbial population were monitored during olive fermentation. Extracts of freshly harvested olive fruits exhibited significantly higher phenolic content than extracts of processed olives. The interaction of irrigation and fermentation appeared to have a significant effect on the chemical and sensory characteristics of the end product. The bitter taste of olive fruit was positively correlated with the level of total phenolics, but negatively correlated with the overall acceptability for direct consumption. The fermentation process was accelerated in the presence of lactic acid bacteria inoculants, indicating the potential use of these microorganisms as quality control markers in table olives during processing.

"Philadelphia-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a molecularly distinct tyrosine kinase-driven cancer that has a high relapse rate and poor response toward combinatorial chemotherapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in the clinic improve the survival of patients with Ph-like ALL. Engineered antibody and cell-based immunotherapies can advance treatment for this genetic subtype of ALL. Allogeneic memory-like natural killer (ML-NK) cells have been used to treat leukemia and have shown a low risk of graft-versus-host reaction, which may be combined with leukemia epitope-targeting antibodies. However, mutation or pathway-directed TKI of Ph-like ALL can interfere with memory function and antibody-dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In this study, we explored the potential of ML-NK cells and Fc-enhanced CD19-ADCC in combination with TKI directed against kinase-driven leukemia models, including patient-derived xenografted Ph-like ALL. We demonstrate that receptor cross-linking in coculture with K562 feeder cells generated a more robust memory-like state of NK cells than coactivation with soluble IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18, as determined by genomic and functional studies. After receptor cross-linking and subsequent ILs preactivation, the optimized ML-NK cells showed enhanced antileukemic effector functions, which could compensate for exhausted B-cell precursor leukemia-infiltrating primary NK cells. TKI differentially affected multiple features of NK cell biology including viability, expansion, metabolism, receptor repertoire, and cytotoxicity. ADCC was maintained upon exposure to specific Abelson (ABL) or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, in contrast to the multitarget TKI dasatinib impeding spleen tyrosine kinase-dependent ADCC. In conclusion, optimized ML-NK cell and CD19 antibody-based immunotherapy combined with carefully selected TKI demonstrates significant in vitro treatment efficacy in kinase-driven leukemia.",0
"A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their tannin content using the proposed method.",1
"Dietary estrogens, such as lignans, are similar in structure to endogenous sex steroid hormones and may act in vivo to alter hormone metabolism and subsequent cancer risk. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary intake of a lignan-rich plant food (flaxseed) on urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal women. This randomized, cross-over trial consisted of three 7-week feeding periods during which 31 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 52-82 years, consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5, or 10 grams of ground flaxseed per day. Urine samples collected for 2 consecutive days during the last week of each feeding period were analyzed for lignan content (enterodiol, enterolactone, and matairesinol) by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared with the 0-gram flaxseed diet, consumption of 5 or 10 grams of flaxseed significantly increased excretion of enterodiol by 1,009 and 2,867 nmol/day, respectively; significantly increased excretion of enterolactone by 21,242 and 52,826 nmol/day, respectively; and significantly increased excretion of total lignans (enterodiol + enterolactone + matairesinol) by 24,333 and 60,640 nmol/day, respectively. Excretion of matairesinol was not significantly altered by flaxseed consumption. Consumption of flax, a significant source of dietary estrogens, in addition to their habitual diets increased excretion of enterodiol and enterolactone, but not matairesinol, in a dose-dependent manner in this group of postmenopausal women. Urinary excretion of lignan metabolites is a dose-dependent biomarker of flaxseed intake within the context of a habitual diet.",1
"Abstract. Direct spectrophotometric determination of quercetin content in onions (Allium cepa L.) was investigated as a possible alternative to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Quercetin content in five onion varieties was monitored at 362 nm and quantified using simple spectrophotometric and HPLC methods. HPLC revealed that 3,4'-Qdg and 4'-Qmg comprised up to 93% of total flavonol content detected in the studied varieties. These major quercetin conjugates combined (3,4'-Qdg + 4'-Qmg) and total flavonol conjugates quantified by HPLC correlated closely with spectrophotometer values. Correlation coefficients were 0.96 (P < 0.0001) for 3,4'-Qdg + 4'-Qmg and 0.97 (P < 0.0001) for total flavonol conjugates in onion. Simple spectrophotometric procedure proved to be a valid, efficient, and cost-effective method for the quantification of total quercetin in onion. Chemical names used: quercetin-3,4'-Odiglucoside (3,4'-Qdg); quercetin-4'-O-glucoside (4'-Qmg).",1
"Haploidentical donor transplantation (HIDT) with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is a promising alternative donor option for adults with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The optimal conditioning regimen and GVHD prophylaxis strategy in this patient population remain unclear, however. We evaluated a newly optimized reduced-toxicity conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine 150 mg/m",0
"Extractable phenolic compounds, classified as total phenolics, resorcinols, catechols and galloyls, were determined in cereals and legume food grains commonly consumed in Tanzania, using various colorimetric methods. Grain samples of red sorghum (udo), finger millet, cowpea, mung bean and brown kidney bean were further processed—soaked in water at different pHs, germinated, cooked or dehulled (legumes only)—and the effect on extractable phenolics was analysed. In untreated grains, total phenolics ranged from 0.9 to 33.7, catechols from 0.8 to 13.5 and resorcinols from 0.2 to 11 mg catechin equivalents (CE) g−1. Galloyls (tannic acid equivalents, TAE) were found in negligible amounts in most grains, but in appreciable amounts in red sorghum (5.5 mg g−1). Processing of grains led to variable effects on the extractable phenolics. Soaking the grains significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the amount of total extractable phenolics in red sorghum, finger millet and cowpea, with alkali and acidic media being more effective. Water soaking had no effect on total extractable phenolics in mung bean and water, while alkali and acidic soaking had no effect on total extractable phenolics in brown kidney bean. Extractable catechols and resorcinols were affected by soaking in a similar pattern to total extractable phenolics. Germination reduced total extractable phenolics, catechols and resorcinols in all samples, except for catechols in mung bean. Cooking (boiling of grains) was more effective in reducing total extractable phenolics in cereals than germination and water soaking, while dehulling was the most effective method for reducing total extractable phenolics in legumes (p < 0.01).",1
"An RP-HPLC method for the determination of flavanols (catechins), theogallin, gallic acid and caffeine, including the sample preparation using a solid-phase extraction technique, has been developed. HPLC separation was performed on a Hypersil-ODS column using a gradient method with 2% acetic acid (aq) and acetonitrile as solvents. The method has been applied to green, oolong and black tea samples as well as tea extracts. The contents in different kinds of tea were 0.93–5.74 g/100 g dry mass for epigallocatechin gallate, 0.73–3.25 g/100 g dry mass for epigallocatechin, 0.17–1.16 g/100 g dry mass for epicatechingallate, 0.04–0.48 g/100 g dry mass for catechin, 0.1–0.8 g/100 g dry mass for epicatechin, 0.17–0.97 g/100 g dry mass for theogallin, 0.06–0.62 g/100 g dry mass for gallic acid and 2.25–4.33 g/100 g dry mass for caffeine. Instant tea contained 2–3-fold higher amounts. As expected the contents of flavanols in green teas were higher than in black teas, for gallic acid it was the opposite. Furthermore, the influence of different extraction methods on the contents of these compounds has been investigated.",1
"Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most common leukemia in children, with the T-cell subtype (T-ALL) accounting for 15% of those cases. Despite advancements in the treatment of T-ALL, patients still face a dismal prognosis following their first relapse. Relapse can be attributed to the inability of chemotherapy agents to eradicate leukemia stem cells (LSC), which possess self-renewal capabilities and are responsible for the long-term maintenance of the disease. Mitochondria have been recognized as a therapeutic vulnerability for cancer stem cells, including LSCs. Mitocans have shown promise in T-ALL both",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) occurs in approximately 25-30% of adult ALL. Currently, treatment approaches for adult patients with T-ALL remain quite limited, with intensive multiagent chemotherapy serving as the backbone; however, the cure rate remains unsatisfactory. Thus, the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies, especially targeted therapies, is crucial. Clinical research efforts are now focused on adding targeted therapy that has selective activity for T-ALL to the backbone chemotherapy regimen. To date, nelarabine remains the only targeted agent specifically approved for relapsed T-ALL, and the use of nelarabine in the first-line regimen is still being studied. Meanwhile, a number of novel targeted therapies with low toxicity, such as immunotherapies, are being actively investigated. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of T-cell malignancies has not been as successful as in treating B-ALL due to fratricide. Numerous approaches are now being designed to address this challenge. Novel therapies targeting molecular aberrations in T-ALL are also actively investigated. T-ALL lymphoblasts overexpress BCL2 protein, which makes it an intriguing therapeutic target. This review summarizes the latest updates on targeted treatment of T-ALL from the 2022 ASH annual meeting.",0
"Childhood leukemia is a common malignant tumor worldwide, affecting survival rates and posing medical and public health challenges. Assessing its global burden is essential for informing prevention, treatment, and policy efforts. This is a cross-sectional study based on data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, covering the years 1990 to 2021 and including 204 countries and regions. We analyzed the incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) for childhood leukemia. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, gender, region, and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) levels to explore disparities and trends. Since 1990, the global burden of childhood leukemia has decreased significantly, with a 59.03% reduction in DALYs. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) experienced the largest decline, with incidence, mortality, and DALYs reduced by more than 70%. However, disparities persist: boys generally have a higher burden, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains the most common subtype. East Asia and Andean Latin America reported the highest burden of ALL in 2021. Incidence is highest in high-SDI regions, but mortality rates decrease as SDI increases. Similar trends were observed for DALYs, with better outcomes in high-SDI regions. Since 1990, childhood leukemia DALYs decreased by 59.03%, with CML showing the largest decline (> 70% in incidence, mortality, and DALYs). ALL remains the most common subtype, with the highest burden in East Asia and Andean Latin America. High-SDI regions report higher incidence but lower mortality, indicating better outcomes than low-SDI regions.",0
"Potatoes, green peppers, zucchinis and eggplants were shallow fried in virgin olive oil (VOO) according to the Mediterranean traditional culinary practice. Zucchinis and eggplants were also blanketed with wheat flour or batter prior to frying. Polyphenols and hydroxy pentacyclic triterpene acids (HPTAs) were determined by GC/MS, while α-tocopherol was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Among 12 polyphenols determined, tyrosol predominated in frying oils and zucchini samples, while chlorogenic acid was the major phenolic species in the other vegetable samples. The triterpene acids maslinic, oleanolic and ursolic were determined in frying oils and fried vegetables, while α-tocopherol was present in all samples. Besides water loss and oil absorption, shallow frying resulted in partial loss of all the antioxidants studied in frying oils and enrichment of fried vegetables with olive oil antioxidants, which was in some extent affected by the type of vegetable fried and the culinary practice followed. The overall retention of the antioxidants in oil and food ranged from 32% to 64% for α-tocopherol, 25% to 70% for polyphenols and 35% to 83% for HPTA. It appears that vegetables fried in VOO provide an additional intake of α-tocopherol, terpenic acids and polyphenols as tyrosol and chlorogenic acid.",1
"The bioavailability of ferulic acid (FA; 3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and its metabolites was investigated in rat plasma and urine after an oral short-term ingestion of 5.15 mg/kg of FA. Free FA, glucuronoconjugates, and sulfoconjugates were quickly detected in plasma with a peak of concentration found 30 min after ingestion. Sulfoconjugates were the main derivates ( approximately 50%). In urine, the cumulative excretion of total metabolites reached a plateau 1.5 h after ingestion, and approximately 40% were excreted by this way. Free FA recovered in urine represented only 4.9 +/-1.5% of the native FA consumed by rats. Glucuronoconjugates and sulfoconjugates represented 0.5 +/- 0.3 and 32.7 +/- 7.3%, respectively. These results suggested that a part of FA incorporated in the diet was quickly absorbed and largely metabolized in sulfoconjugates before excretion in urine.",1

"The anthocyanic composition of the 1996 and 1997 harvests of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat red wines from Uruguay was studied through the determination of their delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin glucoside content, together with the corresponding acyl derivatives. The anthocyanic proles of each variety showed signicant differences, which may be used in their classication. Wine distribution according to variety was veried through the application of discriminative analysis. The most important anthocyanins in varietal differentiation were the petunidin and malvidin glucosides, together with the acetyl esters of the petunidin, peonidin and malvidin glucosides, indicating the importance of the methoxylation for varietal differentiation. The total anthocyanin average content and most of the individual anthocyanins analysed were higher in the Tannat wines. The concentrations of delphinidin, petunidin and their derivatives apparently dene the anthocyanic proles of the Tannat wines as compared to the Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon wines of Uruguay.",1
"In KMT2A-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive malignancy, oncogenic KMT2A-fusion proteins inappropriately recruit DOT1L to promote leukemogenesis, highlighting DOT1L as an attractive therapeutic target. Unfortunately, treatment with the first-in-class DOT1L inhibitor pinometostat eventually leads to non-responsiveness. To understand this we established acquired pinometostat resistance in pediatric KMT2A::AFF1",0
"Consumers are demanding more fresh appearing, more convenient and healthier fruit products. At the same time fruit industries look for technologies to decontaminate fruit products by minimising losses of nutritional and sensorial quality. Microwave heating technology gives the opportunity to have a fast heat process in a continuous mode. Granny Smith apple purée, with natural additives, was prepared and submitted to a) short microwave treatment during 35 s at 652 W. The effects of the treatment were evaluated looking for, the stability of vitamin C, total polyphenol content, as well as viscosity, colour and titratable acidity over a period of two weeks. Its effect on E. coli, L. innocua and indigenous microbiota was evaluated. Results showed that while a reduction of microorganisms was achieved, the treatment could not inactivate the enzymes present in the product and prevent vitamin C degradation. On the other hand the treatment did not affect the stability of the viscosity and titratable acidity during storage period.",1
"In resource-limited countries, access to advanced therapies like CAR T-cell therapy is often unattainable. Clinical trials face challenges, with pediatric populations frequently excluded or experiencing significant delays. This highlights the need for alternative strategies to address high relapse risks in pediatric acute leukemia post-stem cell transplant. This retrospective study included pediatric acute leukemia patients who underwent HSCT between 2014 and 2024. Post-HSCT maintenance therapy became standard practice in 2021, utilizing agents like venetoclax, decitabine, azacitidine, blinatumomab, DLI, and targeted therapies. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS); secondary outcomes included relapse rate and treatment-related toxicities. Among 94 patients (64 with ALL, 30 with AML), ALL patients receiving maintenance therapy had an OS of 78% versus 47% without maintenance (p=0.02); DFS was 64% with maintenance and 45% without (p=0.12). In AML patients, maintenance was associated with an OS of 88% compared to 27% without. Relapse rates decreased in maintenance-treated patients, especially among AML patients with pre-transplant MRD positivity. Treatments were generally well-tolerated, with manageable toxicities. Post-HSCT maintenance therapy is feasible in resource-limited settings and may improve survival outcomes. Strategies like hypomethylating agents with venetoclax in T-ALL and post-HSCT blinatumomab in B-ALL show potential benefits. Challenges include drug access and standardizing protocols. Further trials are needed to validate these findings in low- and middle-income countries.",0
"The effects of Trametes hirsuta laccase alone and in combination with Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus subtilis xylanases on dough extensibility were studied using the Kieffer test to determine the dough extensibility (Ex) and the resistance to stretching (Rmax). Laccase treatment resulted in dough hardening: the Rmax of dough increased and the Ex at Rmax decreased as a function of dosage (5–50nkat/g flour). Xylanases softened flour and gluten doughs. Hardening by laccases and softening by xylanases was weaker in gluten doughs. Dough hardening, observed in the laccase treatments, decreased as a function of dough resting time. The softening effect occurred especially at higher laccase dosages (≈50nkat/g flour). The softening phenomenon was related to the laccase-mediated depolymerization of the cross-linked AX network. In combined laccase and xylanase treatments, the effect of laccase was predominant, especially at low xylanase dosage, but when xylanase was added to flour dough at high concentrations, the hardening effect of laccase on dough was decreased. In combined laccase and xylanase treatments in gluten doughs, similar decreases in laccase-mediated hardening were not seen.",1
"Both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) assay with fluorescein as the fluorescent probe and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride as a peroxyl radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, spices, cereals, infant, and other foods. Most of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORAC(FL) values (H-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.87 to 2641 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, whereas lipophilic ORAC(FL) values (L-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 micromol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORAC(FL) values were <10% of the H-ORAC(FL) values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated by combining L-ORAC(FL) and H-ORAC(FL). Differences of ORAC(FL) values in fruits and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods to evaluate the impact of processing on ORAC(FL). The data demonstrated that processing can have significant effects on ORAC(FL). Considering all of the foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORAC(FL) showed a very weak correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996).",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has offered new opportunities for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL). However, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) are the two most common toxicities following CAR-T cell therapy. At present, whether the occurrence of CRS and ICANS will impact CAR-T activity remains unknown; this affects the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T. In this multicenter retrospective study, we enrolled 93 patients with r/r B-ALL receiving anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy at four medical centers. We evaluated their complete response (CR) rates, minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR rates, and survival outcomes. Among the included patients, 76 (81.7%) developed CRS and 16 (5.3%) developed ICANS. Fifteen patients experienced concurrent CRS and ICANS. However, no significant differences were noted in CR or MRD-negative CR rates between patients with and without CRS/ICANS. Furthermore, no significant difference was noted in leukemia-free survival (LFS) (p = 0.869 for CRS and p = 0.276 for ICANS) or overall survival (OS) (p = 0.677 for CRS and p = 0.326 for ICANS) between patients with and without CRS/ICANS. Similarly, patients with concurrent CRS and ICANS exhibited no differences in OS and LFS when compared with other patients. Multivariate analysis showed that the development of CRS and ICANS was not associated with any difference in OS and LFS. Patients with CRS/ICANS experience similar clinical outcomes compared with those without CRS/ICANS following anti-CD19 CAR-T therapy.",0
"The current understanding highlights the intricate relationship between leukemic cells and their microenvironment, emphasizing the significant impact of environmental factors on chemotherapy resistance or sensitivity. Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) play a crucial role in facilitating intercellular communication, significantly contributing to the complex dynamics of cancer pathology and treatment outcomes. This study aims to investigate the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of PMP, Ara-C, and their combinations on cancer cells, as well as their influence on the expression of critical genes like PMPs were isolated through centrifugation at varying speeds, and their concentration was determined using the BCA assay. The size and immunophenotypic characteristics of PMPs were analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and flow cytometry. The cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of PMP, Ara-C, and their combinations on Nalm-6 cells were assessed using the MTT assay, the trypan blue exclusion assay, and flow cytometry. Gene expression levels were analyzed using real-time PCR. According to our research findings, PMPs did not independently impact the viability and apoptosis of Nalm-6 cells; however, they synergistically augmented Ara-C's suppressive impact on viability and apoptosis. The MTT assay showed that both PMPs and Ara-C, whether administered alone or in combination, had a cytotoxic effect on the Nalm-6 cells. Furthermore, the combined treatment significantly affected the expression of Our study demonstrates that PMPs have the potential to improve the effectiveness of Ara-C chemotherapy in treating ALL. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between PMP and chemotherapy agents, offering potential insights for optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes in ALL.",0
"This study explores the material basis and biological functions of meridian interstitial channels in mini-pigs proximal to the stomach meridian by analyzing differential proteomics between interstitial channels and adjacent non-interstitial channel tissues. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) under data-dependent acquisition mode was employed to analyze and identify the proteome of subcutaneous connective tissues along the stomach meridian and adjacent tissues. SWATH MS GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis revealed differences in molecular functions, biological processes, and metabolic pathways among differential proteins. Most downregulated proteins were enzyme functional proteins involved in amino acid metabolism (GOT1), adenosine nucleotide balance conversion (AK1), and calcium ion-binding processes (ANXA6). Most upregulated proteins were structural proteins in the extracellular matrix-collagen proteins (COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A3, COL6A6, COL12A1, COL14A1) and proteoglycans (DCN, BGN, FMOD)-involved in influencing and regulating collagen fiber generation and arrangement. Intriguingly, almost all differential proteins were associated with gastrointestinal diseases, implying a pathological correlation of differential proteins in the stomach meridian interstitial channel. The stomach meridian interstitial channels in mini-pigs show 72 differentially expressed proteins compared to adjacent tissues. These differences include the upregulation of structural proteins and downregulation of functional proteins, potentially forming the molecular biological basis for the structural and functional specificity of meridians.",0

"The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers produced in Italy. These amounts represent 5 and 10% of the non-tannic, non-flavonoid phenols in wort and beer, respectively.",1
"This study systematically evaluated the humoral immune responses and cytokine profiles of 259 pediatric participants, comprising both healthy individuals and patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), following either administration of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or natural infection. The data indicate that vaccination elicits measurable immune responses in both groups, supporting its relevance in immunocompromised pediatric populations. Although antigen-specific responses to the spike (S) protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD) were attenuated in the ALL cohort, levels of neutralizing antibodies and antibodies capable of inhibiting RBD-ACE2 binding were comparable to those in healthy controls, suggesting that functional antibody-mediated immunity can still be achieved in ALL patients. Notably, vaccinated ALL patients exhibited higher neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 prototype strain and major variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Delta) than their healthy counterparts. However, both groups demonstrated markedly reduced responses to the Omicron variant, underscoring its substantial immune escape potential. Cytokine analysis revealed dysregulated expression patterns in the ALL group, with minimal modulation following vaccination, in contrast to the immunosuppressive cytokine regulation observed in healthy individuals. Importantly, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway emerged as a key component in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 among healthy subjects. These insights provide a scientific basis for the optimization of COVID-19 immunization strategies tailored to vulnerable pediatric groups.",0
"Hepatotoxicity is a well-documented complication of induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but our understanding of the biological mechanisms is limited. We identified 314 patients with ALL (age 1-19 years) treated at Texas Children's Hospital (2007-2018) with diagnostic bone marrow plasma available for metabolomic profiling: 234 for discovery and 80 for replication. Hepatotoxicity during induction therapy was defined as: 1) transaminitis: grade ≥3 AST or ALT, or 2) conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: conjugated bilirubin (c.bili) >3 mg/dL. Untargeted profiling detected 519 metabolites in both cohorts. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for each metabolite were calculated with logistic regression, accounting for sex, age, body mass index, race/ethnicity, and treatment intensity. The population was 56% Latino, 57% male, 92% B-cell ALL, 25% overweight/obese, and 57% NCI standard risk disease at a median age of 5 years. Transaminitis was observed in 34% of the discovery and 24% of the replication cohort. Seven instances of c.bili >3 mg/dL were observed in the discovery cohort, with none in the replication cohort. Twelve metabolites were associated with transaminitis (p<0.05) in the discovery cohort, including two that replicated (p<0.05): 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (aOR-combined = 1.88 [95% CI: 1.26-2.79], p=0.002) and 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-palmitoleoyl-GPC (aOR-combined = 1.56 [95% CI: 1.17-2.09], p=0.003). In the discovery cohort, 34 metabolites were associated with c.bili >3 mg/dL, including the top association of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (aOR = 5.76 [95% CI: 2.20-23.16], p=0.002). We observed and replicated associations between phosphatidylcholine metabolites at ALL diagnosis and hepatotoxicity during induction therapy, suggesting a potential role for lipid dysregulation in the development of hepatotoxicity.",0
"The anthocyanins and hydroxycinnamic acids in 5 cultivars of dark coloured sweet cherries were characterised and quantified by means of HPLC and UV-VIS spectrophotometry. Phenolic components were extracted with pure methanol, without addition of acid and water. The samples were diluted in the mixture of methanol and formic acid just before the injection on the column and separated on Hypersil PEP 300 C18 chromatographic column using gradient solvent system consisting of formic acid, water and methanol. DAD detector was employed and two wavelengths were chosen for determination of different components; 320 nm for hydroxycinnamates and 520 nm for anthocyanins. We detected the presence of cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside as major anthocyanins, while pelargonidin-3-rutinoside was identified among minor pigments. The major hydroxycinnamic acids were characterised as neochlorogenic acid and 3'-p-coumaroylquinic acid. Total anthocyanin content (expressed as cyanidin-3-glucoside) ranged from 29 to 62 mg/100 g of pitted cherry fresh weight (FW), with the highest content observed in Petrovka, a local cultivar. Concentrations of neochlorogenic acid and 3’-p-coumaroylquinic acid ranged from 19.5 to 53.0 mg/100 g FW and from 7.5 to 50.6 mg/100 g FW, respectively. The relative amounts of these two phenolic acids varied widely between the cherry cultivars examined in this study.",1
"Three phenolic glucosides, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside, were analyzed in commercial breads containing flaxseed. The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.",1
"31P NMR spectroscopy has been employed to detect and quantify phenolic compounds in the polar fraction of virgin olive oil. This novel analytical method is based on the derivatization of the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of phenolic compounds with 2-chloro-4,4,5,5-tetramethyldioxaphospholane and the identification of the phosphitylated compounds on the basis of the 31P chemical shifts. Quantification of a large number of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil can be accomplished by integration of the appropriate signals in the 31P NMR spectrum and the use of the phosphitylated cyclohexanol as internal standard. Finally, the validity of this technique for quantitative measurements was thoroughly examined.",1
"Survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has increased over the last 40 years with an overall survival above 90%. Survivors may experience neurological late effects secondary to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This observational retrospective study evaluated the cumulative incidence of neurological late effects among 890 childhood ALL survivors treated in EORTC CLG trials (58741, 58831/2 and 58881) between 1971 and 1998. Median follow-up was 19 years and interquartile range of the follow-up was 15-22 years. At 20 years from the end of treatment, approximately 66% of patients from the 58741 trial (accrual time: 1971-1978) and approximately 15% from the more recent trials had cognitive disturbance grade 1 or higher. Cumulative incidences at 20 years from treatment end of seizures, stroke and leukoencephalopathy were respectively 45%, 16% and 62% in study 58741, 13%, 2% and 5% in study 58831/2, and 8%, 2% and 3% in study 58881. Patients who were 10-17 years of age at diagnosis had a higher incidence of stroke and leukoencephalopathy as compared to those less than 6 years of age. Noteworthy, all neurological late effects continued to occur beyond 5 years after end of treatment. This retrospective study highlights the frequency of neurological late effects in survivors of childhood ALL. With the increase of the overall survival of ALL patients, the role and potential benefit of longitudinal neurological screening should be evaluated in further studies as these neurological late effects become an important public health challenge. This study is part of the larger EORTC CLG 58 Late Adverse Effects (LAE) study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01298388, date of registration February 16, 2011).",0
"White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching (PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and capacity to induce QR.",1
"The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency (AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)). The freezing process produced a decrease of AE values in the four cultivars ranging between 4 and 26%. During the frozen storage, the AE values reached after the freezing process remained unchanged.",1
"The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) = 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums. However, they showed relatively low contribution to the total SRSA.",1
"This study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax (Ven) in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and reduced-dose chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) -positive and relapsed/refractory (R/R) Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL). A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 13 patients with MRD-positive and relapsed Ph(+) ALL admitted between July 2015 and February 2024 at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The cohort included seven males and six females, with a median age of 50 years (range: 37-71 years). Reinduction therapy consisted of Ven and TKI administration combined with reduced-dose chemotherapy. Among the 13 patients, 10 were MRD-positive, and three had R/R disease. Of the MRD-positive group, nine (90%) achieved complete molecular response (CMR), with a median time to response of 47 days (range: 30-80) ; one patient did not respond. Among the three patients who had R/R, two (66.6%) achieved complete remission, while one patient was nonresponsive. The median overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) time for the entire cohort were 21.5 months and 7 months, respectively. In patients who achieved CMR, the median OS and RFS time were 35 months and 34 months, respectively. Grade ≥3 hematologic adverse events occurred in five patients (38.4%) ; however, hematopoietic function recovered in all cases, and no grade ≥3 infections or organ-related adverse reactions were observed. These findings suggest that Ven combined with TKI and reduced-dose chemotherapy may be an effective and tolerable therapeutic strategy for MRD-positive and R/R Ph(+) ALL, particularly in significantly improving MRD clearance rates. 为探讨维奈克拉（Venetoclax，Ven）联合酪氨酸激酶抑制剂（TKI）及减低剂量化疗治疗微小残留病（MRD）阳性及难治复发（R/R）Ph阳性急性淋巴细胞白血病（Ph(+) ALL）患者的疗效及安全性，回顾性分析2015年7月至2024年2月郑州大学附属肿瘤医院收治的13例MRD阳性及R/R Ph(+) ALL临床资料，男7例，女6例，中位年龄50（37~71）岁，再诱导治疗采用以Ven、TKI为基础联合减低剂量化疗。13例患者中，MRD阳性10例，R/R 3例。10例MRD阳性患者，9例达分子学缓解（CMR），中位达到时间为47（30~80）d，1例无效；3例R/R患者，2例达完全缓解（CR），1例无效。所有患者中位总生存（OS）及无事件生存（EFS）期分别为21.5个月及7个月；获得CMR患者中位OS及EFS期分别为35个月及34个月。5例患者发生了3级及以上血液学不良反应，所有患者经治疗后造血功能恢复，同时无重症感染及3级以上脏器不良反应发生。提示Ven联合TKI及减低剂量化疗治疗MRD阳性及R/R Ph(+) ALL，能够明显提高MRD清除率，获得CMR且治疗相关不良反应可耐受。.",0
"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological malignancy. Current intensified therapeutic protocols coincide with severe side effects, and no salvage therapy is available for primary therapy-resistant or relapsed patients. This highlights the need to identify new therapeutic targets in T-ALL. PSIP1, dispensable for normal hematopoiesis, is a dependency factor in",0
"To assess the efficacy of glutamine mouthwash versus standard oral hygiene protocol (SOHP) in reducing the overall incidence, duration and severity of oral mucositis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving High Dose Methotrexate (HDMTX). In this cross-over trial, children with ALL due to receive four courses of HDMTX (2 g/m Sixty four courses of HDMTX were analyzed. The overall incidence of mucositis in the glutamine group was comparable to the SOHP group (71.8% vs 81.2%; P = 0.08). The glutamine group had a significantly lesser incidence of severe mucositis [3.1% vs 44%; RR (95% CI) 0.07 (0.01, 0.35); P < 0.001], shorter overall duration of mucositis [2 (0, 3) days vs 5 (3, 5) days, P < 0.001] and lower median (IQR) pain scores [4.5 (0, 6) Vs 8 (5.25, 8), P < 0.001]. Glutamine mouthwash is effective in reducing the incidence of severe mucositis and overall duration of mucositis and associated pain in children receiving HDMTX.",0
"Corticosteroids, such as prednisone or dexamethasone, constitute integral components of antineoplastic regimens for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) therapy, albeit accompanied by significant adverse effects. The multifactorial nature of interindividual variability in drug response, encompassing genetic polymorphisms, underscores the complexity of pharmacotherapy outcomes. However, pharmacogenetic investigations hitherto have predominantly focused on cohorts of European and North American descent, thus limiting the generalizability of findings to populations with minimal representation. Indigenous populations in Brazil, particularly those inhabiting the Amazon region, exhibit a distinctive genetic heritage, predominantly characterized by Native American ancestry. These populations frequently manifest suboptimal therapeutic responses and elevated mortality rates following ALL treatment. Therefore, delineating the molecular signatures of genes implicated in the corticosteroid pathway within these indigenous cohorts assumes paramount importance. This study identified novel variants within genes associated with the glucocorticoid pathway in indigenous Amazonian populations and conducted comparative analyses of variant frequencies across diverse global populations. The findings underscore the genetic uniqueness of indigenous groups and highlight the potential impact of genetic factors on adverse responses to ALL treatment. Precision medicine approaches tailored to the genetic peculiarities of indigenous populations emerge as imperative strategies for optimizing therapeutic efficacy and mitigating treatment-related toxicities in these communities.",0
"Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing chemotherapy have limited access to rehabilitation support. While rehabilitation on the basis of physiotherapy has been found to enhance psychosocial well-being and motor performance, a viable substitute for this can be aquatherapy. However, no trials have currently evaluated the effectiveness of aquatherapy in this population. We aim to evaluate the comparative efficacy of aquatherapy versus conventional physiotherapy on the motor function and psychosocial well-being of children with ALL. We will conduct a parallel, single-blinded (participant-blinded), randomized controlled trial with embedded quantitative analysis. In total, 54 survivors of ALL undergoing chemotherapy will be recruited from the Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital in Sawangi (Meghe), Wardha, Maharashtra, India. The experimental group will attend a 4-week, thrice-weekly, 45-minute aquatherapy session focusing on exercise-based rehabilitation. The comparison group will receive conventional physiotherapy including standardized exercises. Assessments will be completed at weeks 0 (baseline), 4 (postintervention), and 12 (follow-up). The primary outcome related to motor function will be measured using the timed up and go test and the Pediatric Balance Scale at week 4. Secondary outcomes will include psychosocial well-being measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and functional abilities measured with the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). Health service data, including length of stay in the hospital, hospital readmissions, and emergency department presentations, will be recorded. Semistructured interviews will be completed within an interpretive description framework to explore participant descriptions. The primary outcome will be analyzed using linear mixed effects models. The trial is scheduled to commence in October 2025. The trial will inform future implementation of rehabilitation for children with ALL by providing important data regarding the efficacy of aquatherapy compared with conventional physiotherapy as well as patient experience.

"Simple phenolic acid levels were determined on pooled millstreams of five different classes of Canadian wheat milled to ~75, 80, and 85% extraction. Pooled flours and whole grain were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) to establish endogenous levels of insoluble bound, soluble esterified, and free phenolic acids. Only ferulic acid was detected in the insoluble bound category, which accounted for >80% of the total phenolic acids present in every flour. The soluble esterified phenolic acids accounted for up to 17% of the overall total phenolic acid content within a flour. The major constituents were sinapic, ferulic, and vanillic acids, with minor amounts of coumaric, caffeic, and syringic acids. Free phenolic acids accounted for a maximum of 6% of the total phenolic content of any prepared flour. Ferulic acid was the major free phenolic acid, while sinapic acid was not detected in any flour. Significant correlations (r = 0.64–0.97, P < 0.05) were observed between insoluble bound ferulic acid, individual soluble esterified acids, and most free acids with polyphenol oxidase activity, as well as color and ash content for each class.",1
"Teas represent a rich source of dietary antioxidants. This paper describes analysis of the antioxidant potential of individual tea phenolics using an on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Tea phenolics from Kenyan green and black teas were identified using liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) in conjunction with the analysis of their 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+) radical scavenging ability. Antioxidant potential of flavan-3-ols, caffeoylquinic acids, flavonols, and theaflavins was assessed in comparison to the synthetic vitamin E analogue Trolox. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate was identified as the most potent antioxidant with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 3.0, contributing approximately 30% of the total antioxidant capacity of green tea. Theaflavins retained antioxidant capacity similar to that of (-)-epicatechin monomers whilst conjugated flavonols did not contribute significantly to the antioxidant capacity of either green or black tea. After HPLC analysis of the antioxidant capacity of phenolics in black tea some 80% of antioxidant activity remained unaccounted for indicating the potential importance of thearubigens as antioxidants in black teas.",1
"The suitability of a simple and rapid isocratic RP-HPLC method with amperometric electrochemical detection for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hydroxycinnamic acids and their corresponding aroma-active volatile phenols in wort and beer is reported. The technique gives good specificity and sensitivity, and can therefore be used for routine monitoring of hydroxycinnamic acids in wort and the development of volatile phenolic flavour compounds during the beer production process and subsequent conservation.",1
"Treatment stratification in ALL includes diverse (cyto)genetic aberrations, requiring diverse tests to yield conclusive data. We optimized the diagnostic workflow to detect all relevant aberrations with a limited number of tests in a clinically relevant time frame. In 467 consecutive patients with ALL (0-20 years), we compared RNA sequencing (RNAseq), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), karyotyping, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for technical success, concordance of results, and turnaround time. To detect stratifying fusions ( Combining RNAseq and SNP array outperformed current diagnostic tools to detect all stratifying genetic aberrations in ALL. The turnaround time is <15 days matching major treatment decision time points. Moreover, combining RNAseq and SNP array has the advantage of detecting new lesions for studies on prognosis and pathobiology.",0
"JAK2 mutation plays a clinically significant role in the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by enhancing its oncogenicity. The study aimed to characterize the molecular pathology and computational profile of the JAK2 mutation in an ALL cohort of Pakistani origin. Ninety-three patients were enrolled in the current study. The disease diagnosis was confirmed via flow cytometry and karyotyping of bone marrow aspirate/blood. For the identification of causative gene variations and assessment of their potential impact, the JAK2 gene underwent direct sequencing and predictive computational and in silico structural analysis, respectively. JAK2 mutations were detected in 10 (11%) patients. All mutations were missense with 1 being frameshift. Most mutations showed a similar pattern to the wild type but p.N673H+p.V674L+p.C675W (AAD699), p.V674F (AAD704), and p.V674L (AAD705) exhibited statistically significant stability loss. The triple mutation displayed reduced stability both globally and locally. The pattern of gene defects in JAK2 in the studied cohort showed a disruption in proper folding behavior, evident from increased gyration values, resulting in the hypothesis that these mutations may cause structural alterations in the JAK2 protein that lead to disease progression.",0
"We have recently demonstrated, in humans, the bioavailability of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol; HT), one of the major antioxidant components of virgin olive oil. In particular, we reported that this compound is present in lipoproteins involved in atherosclerotic processes and is excreted in the urine mainly as glucuronide-conjugate. The aim of the present study was to elucidate, in humans, the metabolic fate of HT after ingestion of virgin olive oil. After administration of virgin olive oil, 24-hour urine collections of healthy volunteers were prepared for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses in order to identify and quantify HT and its metabolites homovanillic alcohol (HVA1c) and homovanillic acid (HVA). The results indicate that this compound undergoes the action of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), enzymes involved in the catecholamine catabolism, resulting in an enhanced excretion of HVA1c. We also found a significant increase of HVA, indicating an oxidation of the ethanolic residue of HT and/or of HVA1c in humans. The excretion of both metabolites significantly correlated with the dose of administered HT.",1
"Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of (epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.",1
"Invasive fungal infections (IFI) are life-threatening complications of intensive chemotherapy treatment, with the incidence in pediatric patients ranging from 2% to 21%. In this article, we describe our 5-year experience of IFI in pediatric oncology patients and its clinical manifestations with radiological findings, treatment and outcome. A retrospective and descriptive survey of IFI in children with hematologic neoplasms was conducted at the Department of Oncology and Hematology, Zagreb Children's Hospital. Medical charts of children 0-17 years of age, of both sexes, treated for leukemias and lymphomas from January 2016 to December 2020 were reviewed. In a 5-year period, 60 patients were treated for hematologic malignancy, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) being the most prevalent diagnosis. IFI was verified in 9 (15%) children, predominantly in patients with ALL (75%). The specific causative agent was detected in one child, whereas other infections were classified as probable pulmonary aspergillosis. All the patients received standard prophylaxis with fluconazole and treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole. The majority of our patients achieved recovery. IFI prevention, diagnosis and treatment remain a challenge. Uniform prophylaxis and therapy protocols, as well as environmental control are of vital importance for the development of better strategies in the prevention, early detection and treatment of IFI in pediatric hematology patients.",0

"Bioactive compounds and antioxidant potentials were determined in fresh lotus roots and subjected to boiling for different periods of time (10, 20, 40, and 60 min). The obtained results were compared with the same indices in fresh and boiled white onions. It was found that fresh vegetables contained higher quantities of bioactive compounds than those boiled for 10 min, and these indices were significantly higher in fresh white onions than in fresh lotus roots (P < 0.05). Polyphenols (mg GAE/g) were 3.65 ± 0.2a and 10.48 ± 0.5b; flavanols (μg CE/g) −44.13 ± 2.8a and 91.94 ± 4.3b; flavonoids (mg CE/g) −0.54 ± 0.02a and 1.04 ± 0.03b; anthocyanins (mg CE/kg) −20.61 ± 1.2a and 28.34 ± 1.3b; and tannins (mgCE/g) −0.58 ± 0.02a and 1.69 ± 0.03b of lotus roots and white onions, respectively. The highest antioxidant potential was registered in fresh lotus roots and fresh white onions (10.1 ± 0.70a and 15.0 ± 0.8b; 8.1 ± 0.4a and 23.05 ± 1.1b; 18.7 ± 0.9a and 26.9 ± 1.3b μM TE/g for FRAP, DPPH, and CUPRAC, respectively (P < 0.05) and 26.9 ± 1.5a and 24.14 ± 1.1a μM TE/g for ABTS (P > 0.05). The influence on tumor cell lines Calu-6 (% of cell viability) of fresh lotus roots (75.61 ± 2.03) and boiling boiled for 10 min (76.54 ± 3.14) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for fresh white onions (94.18 ± 3.67) and 10 min (97.02 ± 4.16) white onion. By comparison, the tumor cell lines SNU-601 (% of cell viability) showed similar data for both fresh and boiled vegetables in the range of 86.45 ± 4.07 to 87.28 ± 2.42. In conclusion, the boiling led to a decrease of bioactivity; however, lotus demonstrated higher thermostability than white onions. Three-dimensional fluorescence can be used as an additional index for evaluation of properties. Fresh and boiled (for 10 min) lotus roots and white onions could be considered as a functional food with high antioxidative and antiproliferative activities.",1
"A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid fraction.

"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic respiratory infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, typically diagnosed through sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) to assess the infectivity of TB. This study enrolled 769 patients, including 641 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University as the training group, and 128 patients from Guangxi Hospital of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University as the validation group. Among the training cohort, 107 patients were AFB-positive, and 534 were AFB-negative. In the validation cohort, 24 were AFB-positive, and 104 were AFB-negative. Blood samples were collected and analyzed using machine learning (ML) methods to identify key factors for TB diagnosis. Several ML methods were compared, and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was selected to construct a nomogram diagnostic model. The area under the curve (AUC) of the diagnostic model was 0.721 in the training cohort and 0.758 in the validation cohort. The model demonstrated clinical utility when the threshold was between 38% and 94%, with the NONE line above the ALL line in the decision curve analysis. We developed a diagnostic model using multiple ML methods to predict AFB results, achieving satisfactory diagnostic performance.",0

"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of B cell malignancies, with multiple CAR T cell products approved for numerous indications by regulatory agencies worldwide. However, significant work remains to be done to enhance these treatments. In March 2023, a group of experts in CAR T cell therapy assembled at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland at the Insights in Pediatric CAR T Cell Immunotherapy: Recent Advances and Future Directions (INSPIRED) Symposium to identify key areas for research for the coming years. In session 4B, correlative studies to be incorporated into future clinical trials and real-world settings were discussed. Active areas of research identified included (1) optimizing CAR T cell product manufacturing; (2) ensuring adequate lymphodepletion prior to CAR T cell administration; (3) overcoming immunoregulatory cells and tumor stroma present in the tumor microenvironment, particularly in solid tumors; (4) understanding tumor intrinsic properties that lead to CAR T cell immunotherapy resistance; and (5) uncovering biomarkers predictive of treatment resistance, treatment durability, or immune-related adverse events. Here we review the results of previously published clinical trials and real-world studies to summarize what is currently known about each of these topics. We then outline priorities for future research that we believe will be important for improving our understanding of CAR T cell therapy and ultimately leading to better outcomes for patients.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphomas affect both pediatric and adult populations, therefore, they might be treated by pediatric or adult centers.It has been proven that the prognosis among adolescents and young adults (AYA) is poorer than among children, which remains a subject of research. Many factors are suspected to affect the diagnostic and treatment processes in adolescents and young adults, one of them being the organization of the healthcare system.The aimof the studywas to compare the time intervals between different events on disease trajectory in pediatric and AYA groups suffering from ALL and lymphomas. We collected data on 81 patients diagnosed with ALL (50 children and 31 AYAs) and 100 patients diagnosed with lymphomas (50 children and 50 AYAs). Statistical analysis was performed in order to compare the groups. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the duration of the diagnostic process differs significantly between groups. For patients with ALL, the analyzed time intervals were significantly shorter in the pediatric group than in the AYA group: first contact with a GP - admission to Hematology Department (2 vs. 5 days; pvalue= 0.004), first contact with a GP - treatment (6 vs. 12 days, p-value=0.001), diagnosis - treatment (1 vs. 3 days, p-value=0.003). In the case of patients suffering from lymphomas, the results were similar. The analyzed time intervals were significantly shorter in the pediatric group than in the AYA group: first contact with a GP- diagnosis (21 vs. 40.5 days, p-value<0.0001), first contact with a GP - treatment (27 vs. 65 days, p-value<0.0001). Trend analysis showed that the longer patients had presented symptoms before contacting the primary care physician, the longer they waited for the beginning of treatment both in ALL and lymphomas groups (p-values=0.0129 and 0.0038 respectively). As the diagnostic and treatment processes are longer for AYA patients, actions must be undertaken in order to ensure equality and improve the healthcare system in Poland and possibly other countries.",0
"Analytical data are reported for 20 flavonoids (as aglycones) determined for more than 60 fresh fruits, vegetables, and nuts collected from four regions across the United States at two times of the year. Sample collection was designed and implemented by the Nutrient Data Laboratory (USDA). Analyses of eight flavan-3-ols (catechin, catechin gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin, and gallocatechin gallate), six anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin), two flavanones (hesperetin and naringenin), two flavones (apigenin and luteolin), and two flavonols (myricetin and quercetin) were performed by the Food Composition Laboratory (USDA) using a hydrolysis method for the anthocyanidins, flavones, and flavonols and a direct extraction method for the flavan-3-ols and flavanones. Experimental results compare favorably (few statistically significant differences) to literature values in the flavonoid and proanthocyanidin database previously compiled by the Nutrient Data Laboratory. The results of this study showed a seasonal variation only for blueberries. This study also showed that the variation in the flavonoid content of foods, as purchased by the U.S. consumer, is very large.

"A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative determination of the di- and trihydroxybenzenes catechol (1), pyrogallol (2), 3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder, bread crust, potato crisps, fruits, and cigarette smoke and human urine. Model precursor studies revealed the carbohydrate/amino acid systems as well as the plant polyphenols catechin and epicatechin as precursors of catechol and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid as a precursor of catechol and 4-ethylcatechol, and gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid as precursors of pyrogallol.",1

Following linseed supplementation, combined levels of enterolactone and enterodiol reached 500 ng/ml, whereas after soya flour or clover sprouts the respective concentrations of equol, daidzein and genistein reached 43, 312 and 148 ng/ml. Not all subjects were able to produce equol from daidzein. The possible relationship and role of these weak dietary oestrogens as restraining factors in the development of hormone-dependent cancers in Asian populations is discussed.",1
"Cranberry, which is rich in polyphenols, including anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins, has been found to have various effects beneficial to human health, including prevention of urinary tract infections. These effects have been associated with polyphenols in the fruit. We investigated the excretion of anthocyanins in human urine after ingestion of cranberry juice. Eleven healthy volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed. This study found high absorption and excretion of cranberry anthocyanins in human urine.",1
"To determine the body composition in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors (cALLS) using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and correlate the same with mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) and triceps-skin-fold thickness (TSFT). A cross-sectional study was undertaken to assess body composition in cALLS aged >7 years. Patients who were lost to follow-up after completion of therapy, had relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and those with neurological disabilities/syndromic diagnosis were excluded. Prevalence of high-adiposity (body fat % > 85th centile), sarcopenia (lean body mass < 5th centile) and sarcopenic obesity (positive fat mass index z-score with negative fat-free mass index z-score); and demographic, therapy-related and endocrine factors were noted. Fifty-nine cALLS survivors with a median (IQR) age of 66 (38, 91) months at diagnosis were analyzed. At a median (IQR) duration of 14 (3, 43) months following completion of therapy, 36 children (61%) had deranged body composition; high adiposity (n = 28; 47%), sarcopenia (n = 20; 34%), sarcopenic obesity (n = 9; 15%). Metabolic syndrome was seen in 7 (12%). Survivors with lower mean-age at diagnosis and at enrolment had high-adiposity levels and sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was seen more commonly in females, pre-pubertal children and survivors with a lower mean-interval from therapy completion. Obesity, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were not significantly associated with the type of ALL, steroid dose and cranial-irradiation. High leptin levels were seen in survivors with obesity and sarcopenic obesity. MUAC and TSFT correlated well with DEXA-generated markers. The prevalence of deranged body composition in cALLs from a single centre in Northern India was high, indicating need for early and frequent screening. MUAC and TSFT are reliable surrogate measures for body composition.",0
"Nineteen phenolic compounds including hydroxybenzoic acids, hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, phenolic alcohols, and phenolic aldehydes have been identified and quantified in two monovarietal champagnes, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, by using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system coupled with diode array detection. The identification of four hydroxycinnamic tartaric esters (caftaric, coutaric, fertaric, and 2-S-glutathionylcaftaric acids), two flavanonols (astilbin and engeletin), and some other compounds was confirmed by HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. Caftaric acid and tyrosol were the major phenols. Hydroxybenzoic acids and flavonoids were present at low concentrations. The phenolic compositions of 2000 and 2001 Chardonnay and Pinot Noir vary quantitatively according to the year and the variety, but the chemical natures of the molecules are the same. The total phenolic content determined by colorimetric measurement ranges from 176 to 195 mg/L of gallic acid equivalent and is similar to that described in white wines.",1
"A rapid method for detection and quantification of metabolites of specific olive oil phenolic compounds (hydroxytyrosol monoglucuronide, hydroxytyrosol monosulfate, tyrosol glucuronide, tyrosol sulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate) in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions by solid-phase extraction (SPE) and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS/MS) is described. A 3 microm particle size fast C18 Luna column, 5 cm x 2.0 mm I.D., was used at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B). A linear gradient profile was used for separation at column temperature 40 degrees C. The proposed chromatographic procedure is rapid without loosing its separation efficiency and sensitivity. Validation proofs were carried out for the method described, showing a linear system (r>0.99) and a recovery of 81.9 and 101.3% for hydroxytyrosol and homovanillic acid, respectively. The results show that this method is effective and can be used in routine analysis.",1
"Molecular subtyping of pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has improved patient outcomes through stratification and selection of targeted therapies. Despite extensive genomic and transcriptomic profiling of this cancer, few studies to date have characterized the proteomic landscape, although proteins are the direct targets of many therapeutic agents. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of multi-omic integration of global transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic profiles of samples from patients diagnosed with either of two B-ALL subtypes - Ph-like (",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is one of the most common pediatric cancers, characterized by the malignant proliferation of leukemic cells. Despite advancements in treatment, the prognosis for refractory and relapsed ALL remains poor, underscoring the need for novel therapeutic targets and approaches. To investigate the anti-leukemic properties of MG132, MTS assays were employed to assess cell viability, and flow cytometry was used to evaluate apoptosis. Mechanistic studies, including qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and lentivirus-mediated FOXO3a knockdown, were conducted to explore MG132's effects on the Akt/FOXO3a/Bim signaling pathway. A xenograft mouse model was utilized to validate the in vivo efficacy of MG132 in suppressing tumor growth. MG132 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both ALL cell lines and primary cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies revealed that MG132 promoted FOXO3a nuclear localization by suppressing Akt phosphorylation and preventing FOXO3a degradation, leading to increased Bim expression. Furthermore, FOXO3a knockdown significantly reduced MG132's anti-proliferative effects. In vivo, MG132 markedly inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. These findings suggest that MG132 exerts potent anti-leukemic effects through modulation of the Akt/FOXO3a/Bim axis, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for treating ALL.",0
"Different cultivars of four Vaccinium species [Vaccinium corymbosum L (Highbush), Vaccinium ashei Reade (Rabbiteye), Vaccinium angustifolium (Lowbush), and Vaccinium myrtillus L (Bilberry)] were analyzed for total phenolics, total anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC). The total antioxidant capacity of different berries studied ranged from a low of 13.9 to 45.9 μmol Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh berry (63.2−282.3 μmol TE/g of dry matter) in different species and cultivars of Vaccinium. Brightwell and Tifblue cultivars of rabbiteye blueberries were harvested at 2 times, 49 days apart. Increased maturity at harvest increased the ORAC, the anthocyanin, and the total phenolic content. The growing location (Oregon vs Michigan vs New Jersey) did not affect ORAC, anthocyanin or total phenolic content of the cv. Jersey of highbush blueberries. A linear relationship existed between ORAC and anthocyanin (rxy = 0.77) or total phenolic (rxy = 0.92) content. In general, blueberries are one of the richest sources of antioxidant phytonutrients of the fresh fruits and vegetables we have studied.",1
"Cure rates for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common childhood cancer have steadily improved over the past five decades. This is due to intensifying systemic therapy, recognizing and treating the central nervous system as a sanctuary site, and implementing modern risk stratification to deliver varying intensities of therapy based on age, presenting white blood count, sentinel somatic genetics, and therapy response. Recently, numerous Children's Oncology Group trials have demonstrated the lack of benefit of intensifying traditional chemotherapy, providing evidence that new approaches are needed to cure the patients for whom cure has been elusive. Distinguishing those who require intensive or novel therapeutic approaches from others who will be cured with minimal therapy is key for future trials. Incorporating new genomic biomarkers and more sensitive measures of minimal/measurable residual disease provide opportunities to achieve these goals.",0
"Phenolic compounds and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in the fruits of 11 apple cultivars before and after bruising were studied in relation to their susceptibility to browning. The degree of browning has been determined by the simultaneous measurements of soluble (absorbance at 400nm) and insoluble (lightness) brown pigments. The sum of these two expressing the extent of browning, closely correlated with the amount of phenolics (hydroxycinnamic derivatives and flavan-3-ols) degraded. Maturity did not appear to greatly influence the development of browning.",1
"When discovered in the 50's, isoflavones were suspected to provoke infertility syndrome in sheep grazing on clover. Many others effects of these phytoestrogens have been documented afterwards. To determine the distribution of isoflavone metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than heart, muscle, or thymus. Distribution of isoflavones in ewe tissues is unequal and may reflect specific impact in some target tissues.",1
"Malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors causes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive childhood lymphoproliferative disorder. Activating mutations of Notch, Notch1 and Notch3, have been detected in T-ALL patients. In this study, we aimed to deeply characterize hyperactive Notch3-related pathways involved in T-cell dynamics within the thymus and bone marrow to propose these processes as an important step in facilitating the progression of T-ALL. We previously generated a transgenic T-ALL mouse model (N3-ICtg) demonstrating that aberrant Notch3 signaling affects early thymocyte maturation programs and leads to bone marrow infiltration by CD4",0
"An off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for determining procyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, dimer, and trimer in plasma samples. In the validation procedure of the analytical method, linearity, precision, accuracy, detection limits (LODs), quantification limits (LOQs), and the matrix effect were studied. Recoveries of the procyanidins were higher than 84%, except for the trimer, which was 65%. The LODs and LOQs were lower than 0.003 and 0.01 microM, respectively, for all the procyanidins studied, except for the trimers, which were 0.8 and 0.98 microM, respectively. This methodology was then applied for the analysis of rat plasma obtained 2h after ingestion of grape seed phenolic extract. Monomers (catechin and epicatechin), dimer and trimer in their native form were detected and quantified in plasma samples, and their concentration ranged from 0.85 to 8.55 microM. Moreover, several metabolites, such as catechin and epicatechin glucuronide, catechin and epicatechin methyl glucuronide, and catechin and epicatechin methyl-sulphate were identified. These conjugated forms were quantified, in reference to the respective unconjugated form, showing concentrations between 0.06 and 23.90 microM.",1
"Outcomes for patients with relapsed and refractory (R/R) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are dismal, with few available treatments. Recently, identification of cancer patients harboring neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions is constantly increasing, especially with the advent of NTRK inhibitors. However, the role of ETV6-NTRK3 in T-ALL has not been investigated. This case represented the first detailed report of T-ALL patient harboring a cryptic ETV6-NTRK3 fusion with an unfavorable prognosis, not only because of leukemia resistant to the standard multiagent chemotherapy but also early relapse after allo-HSCT. Acquired EP300 mutation was found at relapse, which could explain the cause of recurrence and affect the follow-up treatment. Combined targeted therapy like larotrectinib allied with pan-targeted BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax, may be a potential maintenance treatment in R/R ETV6-NTRK3 positive leukemia after allo-HSCT. The leukemic clonal evolution might be revealed through transcriptome sequencing and overcome by drugs with universal targets. Our case demonstrated that both comprehensive profiling techniques (such as transcriptome sequencing, multiparameter flow cytometry, and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction) and a multimodality treatment strategy were critical for anticipating an early relapse and personalized therapy of R/R T-cell leukemia.",0
"To describe experiences of fear, coping, and support in 10-17-year-old children under treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). A longitudinal descriptive qualitative design was adopted. Ten children participated in one to three interviews each (24 interviews in all). Interviews were analysed using a matrix-based qualitative method. The variety of fears described related to Children aged 10 to 17 undergoing treatment for ALL experience various fears. Each experience is individual and changes over time, but there are common patterns. Most children used problem-solving or emotional-regulation strategies, but withdrawal was also reported. Even children who can deal with fear need support from their health care professionals, families, and friends.",0
"Immune-effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a significant toxicity occurring with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, with first-line treatment options including supportive care and systemic corticosteroids. Sparse data exist on how to approach progressive/refractory cases of ICANS. We present five pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had progressively worsening ICANS despite systemic steroids, and received intrathecal hydrocortisone with rapid reversal of ICANS. Therapeutic lumbar punctures are routinely used in upfront ALL therapy in pediatrics, with a demonstrable safety profile, thus use of intrathecal hydrocortisone merits further prospective studies in patients with severe ICANS.",0
"Dietary polyphenols are suggested to participate in the prevention of CVD and cancer. It is essential for epidemiological studies to be able to compare intake of the main dietary polyphenols in populations. The present paper describes a fast method suitable for the analysis of polyphenols in urine, selected as potential biomarkers of intake. This method is applied to the estimation of polyphenol recovery after ingestion of six different polyphenol-rich beverages. Fifteen polyphenols including mammalian lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone), several phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, m-coumaric, gallic, and 4-O-methylgallic acids), phloretin and various flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, and naringenin) were simultaneously quantified in human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionisation mass-MS (HPLC-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry) with a run time of 6 min per sample. The method has been validated with regard to linearity, precision, and accuracy in intra- and inter-day assays. It was applied to urine samples collected from nine volunteers in the 24 h following consumption of either green tea, a grape-skin extract, cocoa beverage, coffee, grapefruit juice or orange juice. Levels of urinary excretion suggest that chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, epicatechin, naringenin or hesperetin could be used as specific biomarkers to evaluate the consumption of coffee, wine, tea or cocoa, and citrus juices respectively.",1
"The antioxidant catechin content of chocolate is four times that of tea. Chocolate contributed 20% of the catechin intake in a representative sample of the Dutch population, and tea contributes 55%. Epidemiological assessments of health effects of tea should include other foods that are sources of catechins.",1
"ETV6::RUNX1 leukemia is the second most common subtype of childhood B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Although it generally has a low relapse risk, a significant proportion of B-ALL relapses occur within this subtype due to its relatively high incidence. Measurable residual disease at the end of induction therapy is a well-established biomarker predicting treatment outcomes, while no genomic biomarkers are routinely applied in clinics. In this study, we used multiomic data from ETV6::RUNX1 leukemias to identify genomic features predictive of therapy response at disease presentation. In the deeply characterized sub-cohort we discovered that fast-responding cases frequently exhibited the APOBEC mutational signature and the gene expression signature of high cell cycle activity. In contrast, rearrangements of IGK genes were more frequent in slow responders. Additionally, response-related mutations were identified in transcriptional regulators and tumor suppressor genes (INTS1, NF1, TP53). Copy number analysis revealed that fast responders harbored more frequent deletions of chr12 p-arm, leading to transcriptomic changes affecting genes associated with induction therapy response (KRAS, FKBP4), while a shorter gain in chr12 was more common in slow responders. The identified genetic and transcriptomic markers of treatment sensitivity pave the way for improved disease classification at presentation, potentially improving clinical outcomes.",0
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a major hematopoietic malignancy characterized by the accumulation of immature and abnormally differentiated myeloid cells in bone marrow. Here with in vivo and in vitro models, we demonstrate that the Plant homeodomain finger gene 6 (PHF6) plays an important role in apoptosis and proliferation in myeloid leukemia. Phf6 deficiency could delay the progression of RUNX1-ETO9a and MLL-AF9-induced AML in mice. PHF6 depletion inhibited the NF-κB signaling pathways by disrupting the PHF6-p50 complex and partially inhibiting the nuclear translocation of p50 to suppress the expression of BCL2. Treating PHF6 over-expressed myeloid leukemia cells with NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11-7082) significantly increased their apoptosis and decreased their proliferation. Taken together, in contrast to PHF6 as a tumor suppressor in T-ALL as reported, we found that PHF6 also plays a pro-oncogenic role in myeloid leukemia, and thus potentially to be a therapeutic target for treating myeloid leukemia patients.",0
"Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.",1
"T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in children and adolescents. T-LBL shares considerable biological and clinical features with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). The two entities are clinically distinguished by the extent of bone marrow (BM) involvement at diagnosis, with T-ALL defined by ≥25% blasts in the BM. Although the WHO classifies T-LBL and T-ALL as a single entity, emerging data suggest relevant clinical and molecular differences. This review focuses on T-LBL in paediatric patients, summarizing current knowledge on its clinical presentation, immunophenotype and molecular landscape. We further explore age-associated genomic patterns, recurrent mutations and chromosomal aberrations, with a particular focus on their prognostic relevance. Notably, recent studies have identified NOTCH1-fusions as exclusive to paediatric T-LBL, absent in T-ALL, and are associated with an increased risk of relapse. We highlight the limited applicability of measurable residual disease, lack of harmonized risk stratification and the need for T-LBL-specific treatment adaptations. Ultimately, this review emphasizes the urgent need for biologically informed, risk-adapted treatment strategies and collaborative research efforts to advance care and outcomes of paediatric patients with T-LBL.",0
"Pegylated form of E. coli derived asparaginase (PEG) is a crucial component of pediatric ALL therapy. Patients who develop a hypersensitivity (HSR) reaction with PEG receive an alternative form - Erwinia asparaginase (EA). However, an international shortage in 2017 had made it challenging to treat these patients. We have developed a comprehensive strategy to address this need. This is a single center, retrospective analysis. All patients receiving PEG were premedicated to reduce infusion reactions. Patients who developed HSR underwent PEG desensitization. Patients were compared to historic controls. Fifty-six patients were treated within the study period. There was no difference in the frequency of reactions before and after the adoption of universal premedication ( PEG desensitization is a safe, cost effective, and practical alternative in children with ALL and a Grade 2 or higher HSR.",0
"In the treatment of diseases such as acute childhood leukaemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the thiopurines azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, and 6-thioguanine are used. Thiopurines are antimetabolites and immunomodulators used to maintain remission in patients. They are all prodrugs and must be converted into the competing antimetabolites thioguanosine triphosphate and deoxythioguanosine triphosphate for final incorporation into RNA or DNA. The current therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) method measures the sum of the formed metabolites in the sample, after acidic hydrolysis at high temperature. In this work, the goal is to measure these drugs closer to their pharmacological endpoints, once incorporated into DNA. After extracting DNA from whole blood, followed by DNA hydrolysis, 2'-deoxythioguanosine (dTG) and the complementary natural nucleobase 2'-deoxycytidine (dC) were measured. Chromatographic separation on a HSS T3 column followed by mass spectrometric detection was performed in multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode on a Xevo TQ-XS with ESI in positive mode, within 5 min. The concentration range for dTG was 0.04-5 nmol/L, and for dC, 0.1-12.5 µmol/L. The lower limit of detection was determined to a concentration of 0.003 nmol/L for dTG and 0.019 µmol/L for dC. The intra- and inter-assay imprecision for the quality controls ranged between 3.0 and 5.1% and between 8.4 and 10.9%, respectively. Sample stability for up to 4 years is shown. In summary, a sensitive method to quantify the thiopurines incorporated into DNA as dTG has been developed and will be used in further clinical studies for a better understanding of the mode of action of the thiopurines and the use of this method in TDM.",0
"CD123 ""expression"" is common in hematological malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Flotetuzumab is a novel, investigational CD3/CD123 DART®. We conducted a phase 1 study evaluating safety and efficacy of flotetuzumab in relapsed/refractory ALL (Cohort A) and other advanced CD123-positive hematological malignancies (excluding myeloid malignancies) (cohort B). Thirteen patients (9 in Cohort A and 4 in Cohort B) were treated at dose level 1 (500 ng/kg/day) before early closure due to discontinuation of drug development by sponsor. Two dose limiting toxicities (Grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia) occurred in one patient in Cohort B. Cytokine release syndrome occurred in most patients (85%), all being grade ≤2. Responses only occurred in Cohort B, with a partial response in one patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma and morphological complete remission in the bone marrow in one patient with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. In conclusion, flotetuzumab had a manageable safety profile in advanced CD123-positive hematological malignancies.",0
"Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is characterized by leukemic blasts that express markers of multiple lineages. Compared with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), MPAL is considered to have a poor treatment outcome. We report a case of MPAL T/myeloid not otherwise specified that was initially presented as multilineage lymphoblastic lymphoma and subsequently developed into leukemic MPAL. An acute lymphoblastic leukemia-based treatment regimen was ineffective, but azacitidine and venetoclax therapy resulted in hematological complete remission. Our case suggests that multilineage lymphoblastic lymphoma should be considered to be the same disease as MPAL, albeit with different clinical presentations. Optimal treatment for MPAL has not been established yet, but azacitidine and venetoclax therapy may be a potential approach.",0
"Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially beneficial to human health. To enable an epidemiological evaluation of catechins, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 8 types of black tea, 18 types of red and white wines, apple juice, grape juice, iced tea, beer, chocolate milk, and coffee. Tea infusions contained high levels of catechins (102-418 mg of total catechins/L), and tea was the only beverage that contained GC, EGC, ECg, and EGCg in addition to (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. Catechin concentrations were still substantial in red wine (27-96 mg/L), but low to negligible amounts were found in white wine, commercially available fruit juices, iced tea, and chocolate milk. Catechins were absent from beer and coffee. The data reported here provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic diseases.",1
"The present study aimed to investigate the anti-leukemic effects of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines, Jurkat and Molt-4, and the underlying mechanisms. Cell Counting Kit-8 was performed to measure cell viability. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were assessed by flow cytometry. The expression levels of ATF4 and CHOP mRNA were assessed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, while the protein abundance of SLC7A11, GPX4, ATF4 and CHOP was determined by western blotting. Moreover, malondialdehyde, glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were used to detect the levels of ferroptosis. The results showed that DHA suppressed T-ALL cell viability",0
"Acute liver failure (ALF) is a highly lethal condition characterized by massive tissue necrosis, excessive oxidative stress, and serious inflammatory storms, necessitating prompt medical intervention. Although hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) derived from mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) offer a promising alternative cell source for hepatocyte therapy, their low",0
"The survival rate of children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric cancer, has improved significantly in high-income countries (HICs), serving as an excellent example of how humans can overcome catastrophic diseases. However, the outcomes in children with ALL in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where approximately 80% of the global population live, are suboptimal because of limited access to diagnostic procedures, chemotherapeutic agents, supportive care, and financial assistance. Although the implementation of therapeutic strategies in resource-limited countries could theoretically follow the same path of improvement as modeled in HICs, intensification of chemotherapy may simply result in increased toxicities. With the advent of genetic diagnosis, molecular targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, the management of ALL is changing dramatically in HICs. Multidisciplinary collaborations between institutions in LMICs and HICs will provide access to strategies that are suitable for institutions in LMICs, enabling them to minimize toxicities while improving outcomes. This article summarizes important aspects of the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric ALL that were mostly developed in HICs but that can be realistically implemented by institutions in countries with limited resources through resource-adapted multidisciplinary collaborations.",0
"The ophthalmic manifestations of acute leukemia are critically important, as ocular involvement may be the sole clinical indicator of the disease or signify a recurrence of leukemia. Ocular manifestations include the orbit, anterior segment, optic nerve, retina, and choroid, with posterior segment involvement being the most prevalent. We report the case of a 19-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The patient was in remission after completing the Group for Research on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GRAALL) protocol. A decrease in visual acuity revealed an infiltration of the anterior and posterior segments of the patient's eye, indicating a disease relapse. A cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed substantial optic nerve infiltration. A lumbar puncture confirmed the recurrence, with a positive result for leukemia. It was a relapse of ALL, unmasked by the ophthalmic involvement, which prompted a change in disease status and treatment. Ocular involvement can sometimes be the first sign of the disease or its recurrence, making it crucial to recognize and address promptly, as it may precede other serious clinical manifestations. Therefore, it is essential to systematically include an ophthalmological examination in the follow-up of patients with acute leukemia.",0
"A major portion of the catechins in green tea is not absorbed in the small intestine. Bacteria in the colon convert nonabsorbed catechins into simpler phenolic compounds, which may also be absorbed. During the production of black tea, most catechins are polymerized to complex molecules called thearubigins. Little is known about the microbial degradation of these complex polyphenols, but hippuric acid has been identified as a major excretion product associated with black tea consumption.",1
"The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are found in high concentrations in human plasma and urine after soy consumption. However, in vitro and in vivo data regarding the oxidative metabolism of isoflavones in humans are scarce. Therefore, we have studied the oxidative metabolites of these compounds formed in human liver microsomes and excreted in urine of male and female humans ingesting soy products for 2 days. Human liver microsomes transformed the soy isoflavone daidzein to three monohydroxylated and three dihydroxylated metabolites according to GC/MS analysis. On the basis of a previous study with rat liver microsomes and with the help of reference substances, these metabolites were identified as 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, and 6,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. Significant amounts of the same metabolites except 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone were also found in urine of female and male volunteers after soy intake. Genistein was metabolized by human liver microsomes to six hydroxylation products. The main metabolites were the three aromatic monohydroxylated products 5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. The aliphatic monohydroxylated metabolite 2,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and two aromatic dihydroxylated metabolites, 5,7,8,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone and 5,6,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone, were formed in trace amounts. The same hydroxylated genistein metabolites except the aliphatic hydroxylated one could also be detected in human urine samples. Methylated forms of the catechol metabolites, which were generated by incubations with catechol-O-methyltransferase in vitro could be detected only in trace amounts in the urine samples. This implies that this reaction does not play a major role in the biotransformation of the hydroxylated daidzein and genistein metabolites in vivo. Most of these oxidative metabolites are described as human in vivo metabolites for the first time. Their biological significance remains to be established.",1
"Analysis of tumoral RNA from bone marrow (BM) biopsy is essential for diagnosing childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), risk stratification, and monitoring, by detecting fusions and gene expression patterns. However, frequent BM biopsies are invasive and traumatic for patients. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) circulating in blood contain a variety of biomolecules, including RNA, that may contribute to cancer progression, offering a promising source of non-invasive biomarkers from liquid biopsies. While most EV studies have focused on small RNAs like microRNAs (miRNAs), the role of longer RNA species, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), remains underexplored despite their demonstrated potential for risk-based patient stratification when starting from BM biopsies. We used immuno-purification to isolate sEVs from peripheral blood at diagnosis in B-ALL patients and cell model-based conditioned culture medium (CCM) with",0
"Total polyphenols, total anthocyanins, and reduced ascorbic acid were evaluated in berries belonging to the genera Rubus, Ribes, and Aronia by means of spectrophotometric and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the fruit extracts was tested. Total polyphenols ranged from 140.6 to 888.5 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), total anthocyanins ranged from 22.0 to 460.5 mg/100 g FW, and reduced ascorbic acid ranged from 12.4 to 153.8 mg/ 100 g FW. The average EC50 values for Aronia melanocarpa, Ribes nigrum, Ribes rubrum, Rubus fruticosus, and Rubus idaeus were 1.8, 2.8, 5.3, 6.4, and 8.2 mg FW, respectively. The results indicate that the fruits tested are good sources of natural antioxidants.",1
"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare disorder. This study sheds light on a rare and intriguing case of HLH as the initial symptom in a child with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ph+ALL). This case report, accompanied by a comprehensive literature review, highlights the diagnostic challenges and treatment complexities encountered in the management of such rare manifestations. Moreover, the identification of a novel mutation in the",0
"To investigate whether the bioavailability of isoflavones could be an alternative to fermented soy foods, the conjugated forms of soy nutritional supplement (containing 98% acetyl glucoside isoflavones) were consumed by eight human volunteers (three were Asian people and five were British). Their daily urine samples were collected before and after a 5-week consumption of supplementation period. Conjugated isoflavones of genistein, daidzein and glycitein were hydrolyzed by enzyme, extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether and analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Daidzein, genistein, glycitein, dihydrogenistein, dihydrodaidzein and O-desmethylangolensin were identified and quantified simultaneously with high recoveries. The levels of free isoflavones and total isoflavones were compared, and isoflavone glucuronides were identified much higher than the corresponding sulfates or aglycone isoflavones. This method provided the measurement of isoflavones with high sensitivity and specificity and simplified the sample pre-treatment procedure. The limitation of detections of dihydrodaidzein, 3′-hydroxydaidzein, glycitein, daidzein, genistein, dihydrogenistein and O-desmethylangolensin were 37, 23.5, 12.2, 15.4, 14.8, 2.20 and 0.31pmol, respectively. Only 0.5ml of urine sample was needed.",1
"The content of the flavonoid rutin was determined in different milling fractions of buckwheat seeds and in buckwheat stems, leaves, and flowers. The extraction was performed by using a solvent containing 60% of ethanol and 5% of ammonia in water. The extracts were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (running buffer of 50 mM borate (pH 9.3), 100 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate; determination at 380 nm). In bran fractions the concentration of rutin was 131-476 ppm, and in flour fractions 19-168 ppm. On average, about 300, 1000, and 46000 ppm of rutin were found in leaves, stems, and flowers, respectively. The results indicate that buckwheat could be an important nutritional source of flavonoids, especially in countries with a low mean daily flavonoid intake.",1
"A 21-year-old female with a past medical history of chronic tonsilitis presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sore throat and swelling in her neck for a two-week duration. The patient was noted to have pancytopenia with blasts on peripheral blood differential, so she was transferred for admission at an outside facility for further evaluation and management. Bone marrow biopsy revealed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with 39.5% blasts. CALGB 10403 treatment protocol was initiated two days after her presentation to the ED. The patient also had an extra copy of the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene. One year later, the patient was in remission, and cytogenetic results showed a normal female karyotype indicating that the patient no longer had ALL or RARA gene abnormalities. While a sore throat can be a common chief complaint in the ED, ED providers need to keep a broad differential as there are many serious and potentially life-threatening etiologies such as T-cell ALL. T-cell ALL diagnosis is established with the presence of >20% of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood draw. Cytogenetic changes play a significant role in determining the prognostic factors and management of ALL.",0
"In this work the correlation between the free radical-scavenging capacity and bioactive compounds (anthocyanins, ellagic acid, total phenolics and vitamin C) in four Spanish raspberry cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva and Rubi) and Spanish wild blackberry as affected by freezing and frozen storage was evaluated. From this mathematical study a significant correlation was obtained between the radical-scavenging capacity and the anthocyanin and total phenolic contents in both raspberry (r = 0.85 and 0.83 respectively) and blackberry (r = 0.84 and 0.68 respectively) fruits, but no correlation was found between this parameter and the ellagic acid and vitamin C contents. A key objective of this study was to select the raspberry cultivar most suitable for freezing preservation in terms of the stability of its health-promoting constituents. A two-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) of the raspberry cultivars explained 82% of the total variance of the factors mentioned above. The early raspberry cultivars (Heritage and Autumn Bliss) showed a lower content of bioactive compounds and lower radical-scavenging capacity, while the late cultivars (Zeva and Rubi) showed higher values, and these differences were clearly displayed by the PCA.",1
"Hand-squeezed navel orange juice contains 839 mg/L phenolics, including flavanones, flavones, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The flavanones are the main phenolics in the soluble fraction (648.6 mg/L) and are also present in the cloud fraction (104.8 mg/L). During refrigerated storage of fresh juice (4 degrees C), 50% of the soluble flavanones precipitate and integrate into the cloud fraction. Commercial orange juices contain only 81-200 mg/L soluble flavanones (15-33%) and the content in the cloud is higher (206-644 mg/L) (62-85%), showing that during industrial processing and storage the soluble flavanones precipitate and are included in the cloud. An in vitro simulation of orange juice digestion shows that a serving of fresh orange juice (240 mL) provides 9.7 mg of soluble hesperidin (4'-methoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) and 4.7 mg of the C-glycosylflavone vicenin 2 (apigenin, 6,8-di-C-glucoside) for freshly squeezed orange juice, whereas pasteurized commercial juices provide 3.7 mg of soluble hesperidin and a higher amount of vicenin 2 (6.3 mg). This means that although orange juice is a very rich source of flavanones, only a limited quantity is soluble, and this might affect availability for absorption (11-36% of the soluble flavanones, depending on the juice). The flavanones precipitated in the cloud are not available for absorption and are partly transformed to the corresponding chalcones during the pancreatin-bile digestion.",1
"Cure rates in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) currently approach 90% in the developed world. Treatment involves 6-8 mo of intensive multi-drug chemotherapy followed by 24 mo of maintenance treatment (ALL-MT). The cornerstone of ALL-MT is the daily administration of oral 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), a purine analogue. 6MP is combined with weekly oral methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate drug, to augment therapeutic activity. Some protocols include additional chemotherapy drugs (such as vincristine and corticosteroids) during MT. The objective of ALL-MT is to ensure uninterrupted treatment at the highest tolerated doses of 6MP and MTX. This requires periodic adjustments of 6MP and MTX doses throughout treatment. Tolerance is determined through regular clinical assessments and careful monitoring of blood counts. Tolerated drug doses vary widely among patients, influenced by genetic and non-genetic factors, and require individualized dosing. Suboptimal treatment intensity in ALL-MT is associated with inferior outcomes and results from failure to treat at highest tolerated drug doses and/or interruptions in treatment due to non-adherence or toxicity. Management of MT thus requires close supervision to ensure treatment adherence, periodic drug dose modifications, and treatment to tolerance, while minimizing treatment interruptions due to toxicity. The review highlights these challenges and discusses approaches and strategies for the management of MT, focusing on the Indian context.",0
"The tannin content of milled seed of 55 lines of Vicia faba was evaluated and related to flower and testa colour, seed weight and percentage of testa. Tannin content in the lines analysed was related more to flower colour than to testa colour. No relationship existed between tannin content and seed weight. Lines with low tannin content had a low proportion of testa.",1
"The cortex of 14 French apple varieties (12 cider and 2 juice varieties), one English cider variety, and one dessert apple (i.e., Golden Delicious) were studied for their polyphenol composition. Total polyphenols were assayed by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and the precise polyphenolic composition (monomeric catechins, proanthocyanidins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and dihydrochalcones) was obtained by HPLC following thiolysis. ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses showed that chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid were methylated under the conditions of thiolysis. Depending on the variety, the global polyphenol concentration varied from 1 to 7 g per kilogram of fresh cortex. Cider varieties globally showed a higher polyphenol concentration than the dessert apple Golden Delicious, bitter varieties being the more concentrated. The proportion of the polyphenol classes varied greatly from one cultivar to another. For all varieties, procyanidins were always the predominant class. They were mainly constituted of (-)-epicatechin units with a small proportion of (+)-catechin as a terminal unit. The average degree of polymerization ranged between 4.2 and 7.5 depending upon the variety with an exception for the sharp varieties Guillevic and Avrolles which showed significant concentrations of procyanidins with DPn of 40 and 50, respectively.",1
"This investigation evaluated the content and profile of flavanoid and phenolic acid compounds present in nine Vaccinium species that included domestic blueberry cultivars and sample collections from undomesticated colonies. The study was focused in two areas of inquiry. The first involved extracting and analyzing the berries for total phenolics (TPH), total anthocyanins (ACY), and the antioxidant capacity. Vaccinium species differ in their polyphenolic content, and these high TPH and ACY levels are correlated to their antioxidant capacity. Second, berry extracts were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with photodiode array and mass spectrometric detectors to determine the content and profile of selected bioactive compounds. The flavanoid analytes of interest included the anthocyanidins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonol aglycons, as well as specific phenolic acid components. This semicomprehensive analysis begins to characterize the phytochemical profiles and illustrates the differences in the content of polyphenolic compounds present within these Vaccinium species.",1
"The major flavonoids of mature onion bulb were confirmed as the 3,4′-O-diglucoside (Qdg) and 4′-O-monoglucoside (Qmg) of quercetin using a combination of chromatographic comparisons, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These two components account for over 85% of the total flavonoids in three varieties of onion with Qdg as the main component. Quercetin is detected in these long stored onions but only at low levels of less than 2% of the total. The remaining flavonoid fraction (approx 15%) comprises upto 17 different components of which quercetin-3-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin glucoside are prominent members although each contribute less than 1% of the total flavonoid fraction. There are significant differences in the levels of Qdg and Qmg between the four different onion varieties analysed; Qdg varying from 50–1300 mg kg-1 fresh onion tissue and Qmg from 36–394 mg kg-1. Maceration of the tissue for the three varieties tested led to a loss of Qdg and the appearance of Qmg and free quercetin. In the variety Rijnsburger 50% of the Qdg was degraded in 5 h and had completely disappeared after 24 h. These changes in Qdg can be quantitatively explained by increases in Qmg and free quercetin. The possible significance of quercetin glycosides in the diet is discussed.",1
"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive immature T cell cancer. Mutations in IL7R have been analyzed genetically, but downstream effector functions such as STAT5A and STAT5B hyperactivation are poorly understood. Here, we studied the most frequent and clinically challenging STAT5BN642H driver in T cell development and immature T cell cancer onset and compared it with STAT5A hyperactive variants in transgenic mice. Enhanced STAT5 activity caused disrupted T cell development and promoted an early T cell progenitor-ALL phenotype, with upregulation of genes involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling, even in absence of surface TCR. Importantly, TCR pathway genes were overexpressed in human T-ALL and mature T cell cancers and activation of TCR pathway kinases was STAT5 dependent. We confirmed STAT5 binding to these genes using ChIP-Seq analysis in human T-ALL cells, which were sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition by dual STAT3/5 degraders or ZAP70 tyrosine kinase blockers in vitro and in vivo. We provide genetic and biochemical proof that STAT5A and STAT5B hyperactivation can initiate T-ALL through TCR pathway hijacking and suggest similar mechanisms for other T cell cancers. Thus, STAT5 or TCR component blockade are targeted therapy options, particularly in patients with chemoresistant clones carrying STAT5BN642H.",0
"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) are two subtypes of acute leukemia. However, studies investigating the ability of complete blood count (CBC) parameters to distinguish between patients with AML and ALL remain scarce in the literature. The objective of the present study was to compare the parameters of CBC analysis between Chinese patients with AML and ALL and between patients with M3 AML and non-M3 AML. Prognostic factors for overall survival were also estimated, including sex, age, white blood cell count and hemoglobin. The present study included 147 patients, including children and adults, with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Information on the age, sex, leukemia subtype, initial CBC results and clinical follow-up findings was recorded and compared between the indicated groups using statistical tests of Mann-Whitney U test and χ",0
"Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.",1
"Fresh and sun-dried dates of three native varieties from Oman, namely, Fard, Khasab, and Khalas, were examined for their antioxidant activity and total contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics, as well as free and bound phenolic acids. All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation (n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good source of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents of anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids (1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free phenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during sun-drying.",1
"Studies have shown the power of transcriptome sequencing [RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)] in identifying known and novel oncogenic drivers and molecular subtypes of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The current study investigated whether the clinically validated RNA-Seq assay, coupled with a custom analysis pipeline, could be used for a comprehensive B-ALL classification. Following comprehensive clinical testing, RNA-Seq was performed on 76 retrospective B-ALL cases, 28 of which had known and 48 had undetermined subtype. Subtypes were accurately identified in all 28 known cases, and in 38 of 48 unknown cases (79%). The subtypes of the unknown cases included the following: PAX5alt (n = 12), DUX4-rearranged (n = 6), Philadelphia chromosome-like (n = 5), low hyperdiploid (n = 4), ETV6::RUNX1-like (n = 3), MEF2D-rearranged (n = 2), PAX5 P80R (n = 2), ZEB2/CEBP (n = 1), NUTM1-rearranged (n = 1), ZNF384-rearranged (n = 1), and TCF3::PBX1 (n = 1). In 15 of 38 cases (39%), classification based on expression profile was corroborated by detection of subtype-defining oncogenic drivers missed by clinical testing. RNA-Seq analysis also detected large copy number abnormalities, oncogenic hot-spot sequence variants, and intragenic IKZF1 deletions. This pilot study confirms the feasibility of implementing an RNA-Seq workflow for clinical diagnosis of molecular subtypes in pediatric B-ALL, reinforcing that RNA-Seq represents a promising global genomic assay for this heterogeneous leukemia.",0
"Poor therapeutic indexes are a principal cause of drug attrition during development. To develop multiomic methods for elucidating potentially targetable mechanisms of drug toxicity, we performed profiling of the response to subtoxic and toxic doses of l-Asparaginase (ASNase) in immune-compromised mice. ASNase is an enzyme-drug approved for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but too toxic for use in adults, making it an ideal test case. We collected 20-μL whole blood samples longitudinally, processed them to plasma, and extracted three molecule types (metabolites, lipids, and proteins) from each sample. We then analyzed the extracts using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of 500+ water-soluble metabolites, 750+ lipids, and 375 peptides on a triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS platform. Metabolites, lipids, and peptides that were modulated in a dose-dependent manner appeared to converge on antioxidation, inflammation, autophagy, and cell death pathways, prompting the hypothesis that inhibiting one or more of those pathways might decrease ASNase toxicity while preserving anticancer activity. The present studies were not designed to address therapeutic index directly, because efficacy was not studied. We provide here a streamlined, three-in-one LC-MS/MS workflow for targeted metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics and, as a proof of principle, demonstrate its ability to generate new hypotheses about mechanisms of ASNase toxicity.",0
Red wine consumption may decrease the risk of coronary heart disease through the actions of its constituent flavonoids. (+)-Catechin is an abundant flavonoid in red wine.,1
Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP-ALL) is a distinct biological subtype of T-ALL and is associated with poor clinical outcomes due to the lack of effective salvage regimens that can induce remission and bridge patients to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Targeting antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in ETP-ALL with agents such as venetoclax. We present a case series of five adult patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) ETP-ALL who were treated with a hypomethylating agent (HMA) in combination with venetoclax (HMA-VEN) and demonstrate that this therapy is efficacious and can bridge responders to allogeneic stem cell transplantation with curative intent.,0
"Proanthocyanidins (PAs) have been shown to have potential health benefits. However, no data exist concerning their dietary intake. Therefore, PAs in common and infant foods from the U.S. were analyzed. On the bases of our data and those from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) of 1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to 6-mo-old and 6- to 10-mo-old infants was estimated to be 1.3 mg and 26.9 mg, respectively, based on the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics. This study supports the concept that PAs account for a major fraction of the total flavonoids ingested in Western diets.",1
"T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (T-ALL) is a high-risk hematological disease constituting ~20% of acute leukemias. To date, the only subtype recognized by the World Health Organization's International Consensus Classification is early T-cell precursor ALL. To improve clinical outcomes, several studies have investigated and defined T-ALL genomic subtypes within cohorts of varied ages and geographical locations. These studies have also utilized differing analysis methods including whole transcriptome, exome, or genome sequencing as well as immunophenotyping and cytogenetic testing. As a result, there are significant differences in reported subtypes as well as the frequency at which each occurs. The reported clinical outcomes for specific genomic alterations also depend on patient demographics and treatment protocols. This review synthesizes the data from four T-ALL genomic landscape studies establishing consensus and highlighting differences, details clinical outcomes for the most common genomic alterations observed in T-ALL patients, and proposes novel avenues for future investigation and treatment.",0
"Different commercial edible oilseed samples were analyzed in order to evaluate the compounds involved in antioxidant activity. Fatty acids, triacylglycerols, tocopherols, chlorophylls, β-carotene, squalene, phenolic compounds and CIE L∗a∗b∗ coordinates were assayed. Strong chemical variability depending on the oilseed variety was observed. Antioxidant activity was evaluated for the oils, both for their methanol-soluble phase and the fraction insoluble in methanol. DPPH radical scavenging activity expressed in TEAC ranged between 0.45 and 2.30mmol/l in peanut and maize oils, respectively. Free radical scavenging activity was mainly influenced by tocopherols content (r=+0.70) in oils and polyunsaturated fatty acids (r=+0.61) in the fraction nonsoluble in methanol. Variability of the correlation between the antioxidant activity and the composition of the oilseeds could be attributed to the differences in the squalene, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phenols contents of the oils and their mutual interactions.",1
"Consumer demand for products rich in phytochemicals is increasing as a result of greater awareness of their potential health benefits. However, processed products are stored for long-term and the phytochemicals are susceptible to degradation during storage. The objective of this study was to assess the storage effects on phytochemicals in thermally processed blueberries. Thermally processed canned berries and juice/puree were analysed for phytochemicals during their long-term storage.",1
"Asparaginase-based therapy is a cornerstone in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment, capitalizing on the methylation status of the asparagine synthetase (ASNS) gene, which renders ALL cells reliant on extracellular asparagine. Contrastingly, ASNS expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been thoroughly investigated, despite studies suggesting that AML with chromosome 7/7q deletions might have reduced ASNS levels. Here, we leverage reverse phase protein arrays to measure ASNS expression in 810 AML patients and assess its impact on outcomes. We find that AML with inv(16) has the lowest overall ASNS expression. While AML with deletion 7/7q had ASNS levels slightly lower than those of AML without deletion 7/7q, this observation was not significant. Low ASNS expression correlated with improved overall survival (46 versus 54 weeks, respectively,",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of pediatric cancer, and a leading cause of death in children. Understanding the causes of pediatric ALL is necessary to enable early detection and prevention; congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) has recently been identified as a potential moderate-to-strong factor associated with risk for ALL. To compare the prevalence of cCMV infection between ALL cases and matched controls. In this population-based case-control study of ALL cases and matched controls, cases consisted of children aged 0 to 14 years between 1987 and 2014 with an ALL diagnosis identified through the Michigan Cancer Surveillance Program and born in Michigan on or after October 1, 1987. Cancer-free controls were identified by the Michigan BioTrust for Health and matched on age, sex, and mother's race and ethnicity. Data were analyzed from November to May 2022. cCMV infection measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in newborn dried blood spots. ALL diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years. A total of 1189 ALL cases and 4756 matched controls were included in the study. Bloodspots were collected from participants at birth, and 3425 (57.6%) participants were male. cCMV was detected in 6 ALL cases (0.5%) and 21 controls (0.4%). There was no difference in the odds of cCMV infection comparing ALL cases with controls (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.52-3.24). Immunophenotype was available for 536 cases (45.1%) and cytogenetic data for 127 (27%). When stratified by subtype characteristics, hyperdiploid ALL (74 cases) was associated with 6.26 times greater odds of cCMV infection compared with unmatched controls (95% CI, 1.44-27.19). In this case-control study of cCMV and pediatric ALL, cCMV was associated with increased risk of hyperdiploid ALL. These findings encourage continued research.",0
"Infant BCP-ALL is classified into KMT2A-r and KMT2A-wt groups, both showing heterogeneity. KMT2A rearrangements indicate poor prognosis, but outcomes vary by fusion partner. The KMT2A-wt group includes cases in the B-other ALL subgroup, with unclear prognostic significance. We aim to improve understanding of molecular subtypes in KMT2A-r and KMT2A-wt, focusing on NUTM1 and PAX5 rearrangements. We analyzed 175 infants (aged 0-365 days) diagnosed with BCP-ALL from 2010 to 2023 at the Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology. Genomic aberrations were identified by karyotyping, FISH and RNA-seq. RNA-seq was performed using the Illumina, and gene fusions were validated by Sanger sequencing. There was no difference in survival based on KMT2A partner genes. The KMT2A::AFF1 group showed similar outcomes to other partners, with 2-year EFS of 36% (95% CI, 21%-59%) versus 37% (95% CI, 23%-60%) (log-rank test, p = 0.9). In the KMT2A-wt group (n = 33, 17.7% of cases), NUTM1-r (n = 9) and PAX5-r (n = 10) accounted for 27% and 30.3%, respectively. The NUTM1-r and PAX5-r groups showed excellent survival rates, with 2-year EFS of 80% (95% CI, 52%-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 100%-100%), respectively, but the small cohort size limit the statistical power of the analysis (log-rank test, p = 0.9). Survival in the KMT2A-r group did not differ by fusion partner. NUTM1 rearrangements showed a favorable prognosis, and PAX5-rearranged patients had better outcomes than previously reported. In the NUTM1-r group, the most common fusion, BRD9:NUTM1, showed variability in breakpoints (Exons 3, 8, and 14 of BRD9).",0
"The soy isoflavone metabolite, S-(-)equol, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor (ER)beta and also antagonizes in vivo the action of dihydrotestosterone. It is therefore of interest as a potential new therapeutic agent in hormone-dependent conditions and is under development as a nutraceutical. Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. Three participants were determined to be equol-producers, representing a 25% frequency, and equol-producer status had no effect on natural S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics.",1
"Partial squats are a part of many rehabilitation programs. Progress to deeper squats can only be performed through the partial squat position. However, squats safety, onset time, and rational depth are still controversial. Most previous studies have not considered the influence of posterior tibial slope (PTS) and anterolateral ligament (ALL) on the stress on the knee anatomical elements in partial squats. We have created the new comprehensive knee computer models, which considered muscle exertions while weight bearing 75, 100, 125, and 150 kg in partial squats, included the ALL, two variants of PTS (5° and 13.9°), and two variants of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (a native 6 mm double-bundle ACL and an 8 mm single-bundle ACL graft). Using the finite element analysis, we have analyzed stresses in 14 anatomical elements in each model in partial squats (55° knee flexion and 10° anterior tibia tilt). PTS change from 5° to 13.9° in a partial squat increases stress 1.2-1.3 times on the native ACL and 1.3-1.4 times on the ALL. In the case of single-bundle ACL reconstruction, PTS growth from 5° to 13.9° results in stress increasing 1.2-1.3 times on the graft and 1.3-1.4 times on the ALL. Thus, increased PTS is a significant risk factor, especially in the early postoperative period. Weight-bearing predictably increases stress on the ACL, ALL, and other joint elements proportional to the weight growth. Patients with thinner grafts after the ACL reconstruction may already reach the risk level for graft rupture in a single load in partial squatting if they weigh 125 kg or more. The risk rises with increasing PTS angle or the patient's weight. Because of the reduction of the graft strength by six weeks after surgery by 27%, partial squats in six weeks are associated with forces that may exceed the maximal ACL load even in patients with 75 kg of weight without additional load. In the early postoperative period, partial squats can put the ACL graft at risk of failure. This risk is proportional to the patient's weight and PTS angle, and inversely proportional to the graft thickness. The choice of physical therapy strategies after ACL reconstruction, exercises, and their initiation timing is complex and cannot be standardized for all patients. Factors like the thickness of the graft, the method of fixation, the patient's weight, the ALL insufficiency, the PTS angle, and the patient's goals in the short and long term should be considered when planning the rehabilitation program.",0
"The flavones apigenin and tricin, which occur in leafy vegetables and rice bran, respectively, possess cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical rodent models. Their pharmacology is only poorly understood. We compared their tissue levels in mice in vivo and their metabolism in liver fractions in vitro.",1
"Qualitative and quantitative differences among the constituents in various fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill., family Apiaceae) teas prepared by classical infusion, microwave decoction, and dissolution are reported. Different commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were found in two teas. Quality, activity, and safety of the content of the investigated preparations are also discussed.",1
"Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is associated with poor prognosis. Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can achieve long-term survival, optimal transplantation strategies remain unclear. We analyzed a national registry of adult patients with MPAL who underwent allo-HSCT between 2008 and 2022 in Japan. Among 417 patients, median age at transplant was 44 years (interquartile range, 32-55); 61% were male, 20% were",0
"Early and highly accurate detection of rapidly damaging deadly disease like Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is essential for providing appropriate treatment to save valuable lives. Recent development in deep learning, particularly transfer learning, is gaining a preferred trend of research in medical image processing because of their admirable performance, even with small datasets. It inspires us to develop a novel deep learning-based leukemia detection system in which an efficient and lightweight MobileNetV2 is used in conjunction with ShuffleNet to boost discrimination ability and enhance the receptive field via convolution layer succession. More importantly, the suggested weight factor and an optimal threshold value (which is experimentally selected) is responsible for maintaining a healthy balance between computational efficiency and classification performance. Hence, the benefits of inverted residual bottleneck structure, depthwise separable convolution, tunable hyperparameters, pointwise group convolution, and channel shuffling are integrated to improve the feature discrimination ability and make the proposed system faster and more accurate. The experimental results convey that the proposed framework outperforms others with the best detection performances. It achieves superior performance to its competitors with the best accuracy (99.07%), precision(98.00%), sensitivity (100%), specificity (98.31%), and F1 score (0.9899) in ALLIDB1 dataset. Similarly, it outperforms others with 98.46% accuracy, 98.46% precision, 98.46% specificity, 98.46% sensitivity, and 0.9846 F1 Score in ALLIDB2 dataset.",0
"T cell-redirecting bispecific antibodies establish a connection between endogenous T cells and tumor cells, activating T cells function to eliminate tumor cells without ex vivo genetic alteration or manipulation. Here, we developed a novel dual-specific antibody (DuAb) and an enhanced DuAb (EDuAb) with different stimulation signal to activate T cells, and evaluated their impact on the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The expression plasmids of the DuAb and EDuAb containing CD80 molecule were constructed by cloning heavy chain and light chain variable fragments from anti-human CD19 (HI19a) and CD3 (HIT3a) monoclonal antibody hybridomas, respectively. The activation and the anti-tumor efficacy of human T cells mediated by DuAb and EDuAb were evaluated in vitro. B-cell ALL xenograft NSG mouse model was established to investigate the therapeutic effect in vivo. EDuAb promoted the optimal expansion of primary human T cells with low expression of inhibitory markers in vitro than DuAb did. Both DuAb and EDuAb showed a similar capability in inducing healthy donor T cells to specifically eliminate B-ALL cell lines and primary blasts from patients. The similar ability was also observed in the patient-derived T cells. In vivo study showed that both DuAb and EDuAb significantly alleviated tumor burden and extended survival of B-ALL xenograft NSG mice. The median survival of PBS, DuAb and EDuAb treatment groups were 27, 38 and 45 days, respectively. The phenotype of T cells and cytokine release in peripheral blood (PB) of B-ALL xenograft NSG mice on day 24 were analyzed as well. The results showed that the proportion of CD8 Both DuAb and EDuAb showed great potential as novel treatments for B-ALL in clinical applications. However, compared to DuAb, EDuAb showed a significant advantage in promoting the proliferation and survival of T cells. Furthermore, EDuAb showed a better promising effect on eliminating tumor cells and extending survival in vivo, which provides new insights for the development of new multi-specific antibodies.",0
"Peanuts are an important food crop with many health benefits of their consumption realized by consumers worldwide. Limited information is available on non-nutrient phytochemical composition of peanuts and their relative antioxidant values, knowledge that may serve to increase overall marketability of the crop. Shelled peanuts from eight cultivars and four experimental genotypes with either high or normal oleic acid contents were evaluated for phytochemical, antioxidant, and sensory properties (roasted only) before and after dry roasting under constant time and temperature conditions. Peanuts were evaluated for color, total and individual phenolics, and antioxidant capacity while a trained sensory panel evaluated the peanuts for roasted and burnt peanut flavor and aroma, sweetness, and bitterness. Overall, no meaningful differences were observed for phytochemical and antioxidant properties between high and normal oleic acid peanuts, but differences were present among cultivars. However, high oleic acid varieties had higher burnt peanut aroma and burnt peanut flavor compared to normal oleic peanuts but were not necessarily independent from roasted peanut aroma and flavor. Numerous polyphenolics were separated and characterized based on spectral similarities to p-hydroxybenzoic acid, tryptophan, and p-coumaric acid in both free and bound (esterified) forms. Peanuts were found to be a good source of antioxidant polyphenolics, such as p-coumaric acid, that may be contributing factors to potential health benefits of their consumption.",1
"The presence of resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) and its beta-glucoside, piceid (resveratrol-3-beta-D-glucopyranoside), together with their isomers in wine appears to be one of the beneficial factors conferring a protective effect against cardiovascular disease through red wine ingestion. A total of 42 red and white wines was collected in areas from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan. The wines were fractionated with a C18 Sep-pak cartridge, and the active principles were eluted with ethyl acetate. Crude trans- and cis-piceid were extracted from a Chinese medicine, 'Kojohkon' (Polygonum cuspidatum), and their retention times and UV absorption were confirmed by HPLC. trans- and cis-Resveratrol, and trans- and cis-piceid were analyzed in a short C18 HPLC column, and cis-resveratrol was quantified from the amount of cis-isomer converted from authentic trans-resveratrol that had been treated by UV irradiation. The content of piceid is shown as the resveratrol equivalent. The average content of total stilbene compounds was 4.37 mg/liter in red wines, while only 0.68 mg/liter in white wines. Red wines made from Pinot noir, Merlot, and Zweigeltrebe grapes all had a high resveratrol content.",1
"Blueberries and blackberries grown at various locations in Georgia were collected and analyzed for flavonoids, total anthocyanins, total polyphenols, and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Each sample was analyzed for phenolic acids (gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and ellagic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol). A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with photodiode array detection was used for analysis. Compounds were analyzed as aglycons after acid hydrolysis with 1.2 M HCl. Identification of each compound was based on retention time and UV spectra by comparison with pure commercial standards. Phenolic acids ranged from 0.19 to 258.90 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), and flavonoids ranged from 2.50 to 387.48 mg/100 g FW. Total polyphenols ranged from 261.95 to 929.62 mg/100 g FW, and total anthocyanins ranged from 12.70 to 197.34 mg/100 g FW. TEAC values varied from 8.11 to a maximum of 38.29 microM/g FW. A linear relationship was observed between TEAC values and total polyphenols or total anthocyanins. The data indicate that blueberries and blackberries are rich sources of antioxidants.",1
"CD7 CAR-T cell therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD7-positive hematological malignancies, offering new hope for patients with limited therapeutic options. This review examines the recent clinical advances, challenges, and future directions of CD7 CAR-T therapy. Clinical trials have demonstrated remarkable efficacy of CD7 chimeric antigen receptor T (CD7 CAR-T) cells in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), and other CD7-positive malignancies, with complete remission (CR) rates of 90-95% in bone marrow (BM) and 50% to 60% in extramedullary disease (EMD). Various engineering strategies, including naturally selected CD7-targeted CAR-T cells, gene editing, protein blockers and universal CAR-T cells, have been developed to overcome challenges such as fratricide. While CD7 CAR-T therapy has shown promising initial responses, durable remissions often depend on consolidative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Ongoing research is focused on optimizing CAR designs, improving CAR-T cell persistence, and developing novel combination strategies to enhance long-term outcomes. Safety profiles have been generally manageable, with cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity being the primary concerns. However, prolonged cytopenias and potential long-term immunodeficiency due to depletion of healthy CD7-positive cells remain areas of active investigation. As CD7 CAR-T therapy continues to evolve, future directions include refining patient selection, exploring dual-targeting approaches, and investigating innovative strategies to integrate CAR-T therapy with allo-HSCT. These advancements aim to improve the efficacy, safety, and accessibility of CD7 CAR-T therapy for patients with CD7-positive hematological malignancies.",0
"The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of arthroscopy compared to arthrocentesis and to conservative treatments for temporomandibular joint disorders. Thirteen controlled studies on various patient outcomes were included after a systematic search in seven electronic databases. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for arthroscopic surgery (AS) and arthroscopic lysis and lavage (ALL), and short-term (<6 months), intermediate-term (6 months to 5 years), and long-term (≥5 years) follow-up periods were considered. No significant differences in pain reduction and complication rates were found between AS or ALL and arthrocentesis. Regarding improvement in maximum mouth opening (MMO), both AS at intermediate-term and ALL at short-term follow-up were equally efficient when compared to arthrocentesis. However, at intermediate-term follow-up, ALL was superior to arthrocentesis for MMO improvement (mean difference 4.9 mm, 95% confidence interval 2.7-7.1 mm). Trial sequential analysis supported the conclusion of the meta-analysis for MMO improvement for ALL versus arthrocentesis studies at intermediate-term follow-up, but not for the other meta-analyses. Insufficient evidence exists to draw conclusions regarding other patient outcomes or about comparisons between arthroscopy and conservative treatments. Due to the low quality of the primary studies, further research is warranted before final conclusions can be drawn regarding the management of temporomandibular joint disorders.",0
"The NOTCH pathway is an ancient, ubiquitously expressed cell signalling system that is essential for embryonic and postembryonic cell fate control and tissue growth. It is activated via intercellular interactions between receptors and ligands expressed by neighbouring cells. This releases the latent transcription-promoting potential of the receptor through proteolytic cleavage of the intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and directly stimulates target gene expression as part of a DNA-bound transcription activation complex. To date, it has been assumed that this process involves interactions between ligand homomers and receptor homomers. In this study, we present several lines of evidence in support of the view that NOTCH receptor dimerization/oligomerization (hereafter referred to as dimerization) could be necessary for the transactivation of receptor signalling. We show that (1) NOTCH receptors can efficiently self-associate, which is mediated via a short motif found in the negative regulatory region (NRR) of the extracellular domain; (2) deletion of this motif ablates receptor homodimerization and blocks receptor transactivation; and (3) short peptides specifically targeting the dimerization motif similarly block receptor dimerization and receptor transactivation. Since the NOTCH pathway is corrupted in a wide range of disorders, the newly identified mechanism of NOTCH receptor transactivation presented here, and the discovery of a unique class of NOTCH signalling inhibitors, potentially reveals new therapeutic avenues to treating these diseases. In this light, a proof-of-concept study centred on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is presented.",0

"Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 +/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.",1
"The concentrations of the isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein were determined in a large number of commercially-available soy products by high-performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrode array detection using estriol as internal standard. During extraction, the naturally occurring glycosides were converted into their respective aglycones by acid hydrolysis. The analytes were separated on a C-18 reversed phase column, eluted with methanol/acetonitrile/50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 (40/5/55, v/v/v), and detected by a coulometric electrode array detector using twelve electrodes set to potentials between +250 and +800 mV (in increments of 50 mV) against palladium reference electrodes. The isoflavones could be determined over a wide concentration range (0.8–1135.0 mg/kg for daidzein, 1.9–1442.5 mg/kg for genistein and 0.5–154.6 mg/kg for glycitein). The recovery of the isoflavones in the different matrices was determined by the standard addition method and varied between 40.9–94.4%. The detection limits (S/N=3) depend on the matrix of the soy product and were found for daidzein between 0.3–1.6 mg/kg, for genistein between 0.3–1.7 mg/kg and for glycitein between 0.5–2.3 mg/kg.",1
"Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices (30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.",1
"Graft failure and secondary meniscal tears remain significant concerns following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Lateral extra-articular procedures, including anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft failure and meniscal repair rates. However, their impact on untreated stable meniscal tears remains unclear. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes and reoperation rates between ACLR with and without ALL reconstruction in patients with untreated stable lateral meniscal tears. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed on patients who underwent primary ACLR with autograft hamstring tendon (HT) alone or HT combined with ALL reconstruction (HT ​+ ​ALL) between January 2019 and December 2022. All included patients had a concomitant stable, not displaced or moving lateral meniscal tear left in situ. Clinical evaluation was conducted preoperatively and at a minimum follow-up of two years, utilizing the Lachman test, pivot shift test, Rolimeter measurements, objective and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm score, and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, 11-item version (TSK-11). Reoperation rates and postoperative complications were also recorded. A post hoc power analysis was conducted based on the results of the independent samples t-test comparing kinesiophobia scores between the two groups. Sixty-four patients (average age at time of surgery: 28 years) with a minimum follow-up of 2 years (range: 2-5.5 years follow-up) were included: 31 in the HT group and 33 in the HT ​+ ​ALL group. Graft rupture rates were 9.6% in the HT group and 3.3% in the HT ​+ ​ALL group (not a statistically significant difference). Secondary meniscal surgeries were required in 12.9% of HT patients compared to 0% in the HT ​+ ​ALL group (p ​< ​0.05). The HT ​+ ​ALL group demonstrated lower reoperation rates at the final follow-up (97% vs. 77.5%; p ​< ​0.05). Functional scores showed no statistically significant differences except for improved TSK-11 scores (P ​< ​0.01) and pivot shift test (P ​< ​0.025) outcomes favoring the HT ​+ ​ALL group. In patients with stable lateral meniscal tears left in situ, adding ALL reconstruction to ACLR with autografts may reduce the risk of secondary meniscal surgery and graft failure, with comparable or improved functional outcomes. 3, retrospective comparative study.",0

"Thirteen pomegranate varieties obtained from four different growing regions of Turkey were analyzed for their individual organic acids and phenolic compounds in freshly prepared pomegranate juices. Total titratable acidity ranged between 4.58 and 17.30 g/L (average of 9.82 g/L), and total sugars ranged between 139.6 and 160.6 g/L (average of 148.75 g/L) in pomegranate juices. According to the results of the z -test for comparison of means, intervarietal differences in total titratable acidity and sugar content of pomegranate varieties were found to be significant within the confidence interval of 95%. Organic acids such as citric, l -malic, tartaric, oxalic, (−)−quinic and succinic acids were individually detected and quantitated. On average, citric acid was predominant with a range of 0.33–8.96 g/L (overall mean of 4.85±2.83 g/L). l -Malic acid was the second most abundant, with a range of 0.56–6.86 g/L (overall mean of 1.75±1.59 g/L). Tartaric, oxalic, (−)−quinic and succinic acids ranged between 0.28–2.83, 0.02–6.72, 0.00–0.82 and 0.00–1.54 g/L, respectively. Phenolic compounds identified in freshly prepared pomegranate juices were gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, o - and p -coumaric acids, catechin, phloridzin and quercetin.",1
"Virgin olive oils from percolation (first extraction) have been compared with the corresponding oils from centrifugation (second extraction). The former were characterized by (i) higher contents of total phenols, o-diphenols, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol-aglycons, tocopherols, trans-2-hexenal, total volatiles, and waxes; (ii) higher values of resistance to autoxidation and of turbidity; (iii) higher sensory scores; (iv) higher ratios of campesterol/stigmasterol, trans-2-hexenal/hexanal, and trans-2-hexenal/total volatiles; (v) lower contents of chlorophylls, pheophytins, sterols, and aliphatic and triterpene alcohols; (vi) lower alcoholic index and color indices; (vii) similar values of acidity, peroxide index, and UV (ultraviolet) spectrophotometric indices; (viii) similar percentages of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, triglycerides, and diglycerides; and (ix) similar values of glyceridic indices. Stigmastadienes, trans-oleic, trans-linoleic, and trans-linolenic acid isomers were not detected in the two genuine oil kinds. Hence, the qualitative level of the first extraction oil was superior to the second extraction one.",1
"Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost devoid of radical scavenging activity.",1
"The effects of various thermal processing treatments (blanching, boiling and steaming) of red cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. ssp. capitata f. rubra cv. ‘Autoro’, were assessed for the levels of glucosinolates (GLS), total phenols (TP), total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA), l-ascorbic acid (L-AA) and soluble sugars, as well as for the antioxidant potential by the ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. Individual native GLS were determined by ion-pair HPLC-MS/DAD. There were significant (p<0.05) losses in blanched red cabbage: TP, 43%, TMA 59%, FRAP 42%, ORAC 51%, L-AA 48% and soluble sugars 45%. Boiling gave less extensive reductions: TP 16%, TMA 41%, FRAP 17%, ORAC 19%, L-AA 24% and soluble sugars 19%. Steaming caused no losses for TP, ORAC, FRAP or soluble sugars. However, significant reductions were found for TMA and L-AA, with 29% and 11%, respectively. In general losses were accounted for in the processing waters; however, TMA was not fully recovered, indicating degradation. Total GLS were severely affected by processing, with reductions of 64%, 38% and 19% in blanched, boiled and steamed red cabbage, respectively. Total aliphatic and indole GLS were similarly affected. Lost GLS were partially recovered in the processing water.",1
"Refractoriness to initial chemotherapy and relapse after remission are the main obstacles to cure in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). Biomarker guided risk stratification and targeted therapy have the potential to improve outcomes in high-risk T-ALL; however, cellular and genetic factors contributing to treatment resistance remain unknown. Previous bulk genomic studies in T-ALL have implicated tumor heterogeneity as an unexplored mechanism for treatment failure. To link tumor subpopulations with clinical outcome, we created an atlas of healthy pediatric hematopoiesis and applied single-cell multiomic (CITE-seq/snATAC-seq) analysis to a cohort of 40 cases of T-ALL treated on the Children's Oncology Group AALL0434 clinical trial. The cohort was carefully selected to capture the immunophenotypic diversity of T-ALL, with early T-cell precursor (ETP) and Near/Non-ETP subtypes represented, as well as enriched with both relapsed and treatment refractory cases. Integrated analyses of T-ALL blasts and normal T-cell precursors identified a bone-marrow progenitor-like (BMP-like) leukemia sub-population associated with treatment failure and poor overall survival. The single-cell-derived molecular signature of BMP-like blasts predicted poor outcome across multiple subtypes of T-ALL within two independent patient cohorts using bulk RNA-sequencing data from over 1300 patients. We defined the mutational landscape of BMP-like T-ALL, finding that",0
"This study confirmed the significant role of phenolics in the dormancy of cereal caryopses. Investigations were conducted on two cultivars of wheat (Elena and Alba), rye (Amilo and Dańkowskie Złote), and triticale (Ugo and Bogo), with characteristic deeper or shallow dormancy, respectively. In germination studies, cultivars susceptible to sprouting (Alba, Dańkowskie Złote and Bogo) displayed higher germination percentages than those resistant to sprouting (Elena, Amilo and Ugo). The phenolic acid contents (i.e. free, liberated from soluble esters, and liberated from soluble glycosides) in caryopses were determined by an HPLC method. Caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic and sinapic acids were the dominant phenolic acids detected. The majority of phenolic acids were found in the form of soluble esters. For all species examined, the levels of phenolic acids liberated from soluble esters and the total phenolic acid contents in caryopses showing shallow dormancy were higher than in those showing deeper dormancy. Slight differences in the UV spectra of extracts of phenolic compounds from caryopses showing shallow or deeper dormancy were noted.",1

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has survival rates of greater than 90% in developed nations. However, various sociodemographic factors adversely affect outcome rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To study induction outcome of ALL and various factors affecting it. This was a prospective cohort study which enrolled 86 children up to the age of 18 years with newly diagnosed ALL registered in newly established pediatric hematology and oncology division over the duration of 3 years. Sociodemographic and clinical data was collected. Outcome was assessed using morphological remission, minimal residual disease (MRD) and mortality rate. Of the 170 children with malignancies registered, 86 were ALL. Mean age was 7.09 ± 4.07 years and the M: F ratio of 1.32:1. Sixteen (38.09%) of them had severe acute malnutrition and another 16 (38.09%) had moderate acute malnutrition. Thirty (68.18%) children over 5 years were undernourished. Seventy-four (86.05%) were B-ALL and 12 (13.95%) T-ALL. In total, 28.77% had WBC counts greater than 50 × 10 9 /L. t (12;21) was the most common cytogenetic abnormality. Majority (60.46%) of the patients belonged to lower socioeconomic status. Seventy-one (93.42%) patients completed induction of which 100% attained morphological remission and 64 (90.14%) were MRD negative. There were five mortalities, three (60%) due to sepsis and 2 (40%) due to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Fifty (65.78%) children had morbidities during induction, febrile neutropenia being the commonest. Successful induction outcome rates at par with high-income countries can be achieved even in resource-limited settings of LMIC with support from government and NGOs. Decentralized cancer care centers can eﬀectively pave the way in reducing cancer mortality in children of lower socioeconomic status residing in rural areas.",0
"Complete elimination of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) by a risk-adapted primary treatment approach remains a clinical key objective, which fails in up to a third of patients. Recent evidence has implicated subpopulations of B-ALL cells with stem-like features in disease persistence. We hypothesized that microRNA-126, a core regulator of hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells, may resolve intratumor heterogeneity in B-ALL and uncover therapy-resistant subpopulations. We exploited patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with B-ALL cells transduced with a miR-126 reporter allowing the prospective isolation of miR-126(high) cells for their functional and transcriptional characterization. Discrete miR-126(high) populations, often characterized by MIR126 locus demethylation, were identified in 8/9 PDX models and showed increased repopulation potential, in vivo chemotherapy resistance and hallmarks of quiescence, inflammation and stress-response pathway activation. Cells with a miR-126(high) transcriptional profile were identified as distinct disease subpopulations by single-cell RNA sequencing in diagnosis samples from adult and pediatric B-ALL. Expression of miR-126 and locus methylation were tested in several pediatric and adult B-ALL cohorts, which received standardized treatment. High microRNA-126 levels and locus demethylation at diagnosis associate with suboptimal response to induction chemotherapy (MRD > 0.05% at day +33 or MRD+ at day +78).",0
"The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity (SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of the antioxidant capacity.",1
"The utility of polygenic risk score (PRS) models has not been comprehensively evaluated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common type of cancer in children. Previous PRS models for ALL were based on significant loci observed in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), even though genomic PRS models have been shown to improve prediction performance for a number of complex diseases. In the United States, Latino (LAT) children have the highest risk of ALL, but the transferability of PRS models to LAT children has not been studied. In this study we constructed and evaluated genomic PRS models based on either non-Latino white (NLW) GWAS or a multi-ancestry GWAS. We found that the best PRS models performed similarly between held-out NLW and LAT samples (PseudoR",0
"CD38 and CD47 are expressed in many hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here, we evaluated the antitumor activities of CD38/CD47 bispecific antibodies (BsAbs). Five suitable anti-CD38 antibodies for co-targeting CD47 and CD38 BsAb were developed using a 2 + 2 ""mAb-trap"" platform. The activity characteristics of the CD38/CD47 BsAbs were evaluated using Using hybridoma screening technology, we obtained nine suitable anti-CD38 antibodies. All anti-CD38 antibodies bind to CD38 A panel of BsAbs targeting CD38 and CD47 developed based on the ""mAb-tarp"" platform showed potent tumor-killing ability",0
"Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET), as an adjunct to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, is gaining popularity among pediatric and sports medicine orthopaedic surgeons for the treatment of ACL injury, especially in the female, hyperflexible, and high-risk athlete population. The addition of LET or anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction is typically recommended at the time of index ACL reconstruction surgery and is performed after the ACL graft is tensioned. Rotational instability has been described in cases where the ACL graft was malpositioned too vertically, and in those cases, ACL revision is indicated. In our case, ACL reconstruction was performed in isolation in a hyperflexible, high-risk (volleyball) female athlete, and she had persistent complaints of rotational instability despite an intact and well-positioned ACL graft on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. She demonstrated excessive internal rotation of the tibia in relation to the femur and exhibited symptomatic anterolateral instability on clinical examination, with a negative pivot shift but pain on internal rotation stress. She underwent a second surgery consisting of isolated modified Lemaire LET after examination under anesthesia (EUA) demonstrated negative Lachman and pivot shift. Second-look arthroscopy demonstrated an intact quadriceps autograft ACL graft. She recovered uneventfully, and her rotational instability problem was resolved. She returned to sports 12 months after the surgery and has been pleased with her result. (1)Lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) can be added to increased rotational stability in the setting of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.(2)Although typically added during the index procedure, it can be successfully completed later if needed.(3)The ACL confers both anteroposterior and rotational stability to prevent excessive anterior translation and excessive internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur.(4)LET can augment the ACL graft in preventing rotational instability in the setting of an ACL-deficient knee.",0
"The present study evaluates for the first time in dogs, the kinetics of green tea catechins and their metabolic forms in plasma and urine. Ten beagles were administered 173 mg (12.35 mg/kg body weight) of catechins as a green tea extract, in capsules. Blood samples were collected during 24 h after intake and urine samples were collected during the following periods of time: 0-2, 2-6, 6-8 and 8-24 h. Two catechins with a galloyl moiety and three conjugated metabolites were detected in plasma. Most of the detected forms in plasma reached their maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at around 1 h. Median Cmax for ( - )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ( - )-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( - )-epigallocatechin glucuronide (EGC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin glucuronide (EC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin sulphate (EC-sulphate) were 0.3 (range 0.1-1.9), 0.1 (range 0-0.4), 0.8 (range 0.2-3.9), 0.2 (range 0.1-1.7) and 1 (range 0.3-3.4) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the plasma concentration v. time curves (AUC0 --> 24) were 427 (range 102-1185) micromol/l x min for EGC-glucuronide, 112 (range 53-919) micromol/l x min for EC-sulphate, 71 (range 26-306) micromol/l x min for EGCG, 40 (range 12-258) micromol/l x min for EC-glucuronide and 14 (range 0.1-124) micromol/l x min for ECG. The values of mean residence time (MRT0 --> 24) were 5 (range 2-16), 2 (range 1-11), 10 (range 2-13), 3 (range 2-16) and 2.4 (range 1-18) h for EGCG, ECG, EGC-glucuronide, EC-glucuronide and EC-sulphate, respectively. In urine, catechins were present as conjugated forms, suggesting bile excretion of EGCG and ECG. Green tea catechins are absorbed following an oral administration and EGC-glucuronide is the metabolic form that remains in the organism for a longer period of time, suggesting that this compound could suffer an enterohepatic cycle.",1
"Cancer gene therapy is attracting considerable attention as a new treatment method for overcoming intractable cancers. CAR-T cell therapy has already achieved remarkable results, particularly for hematological tumors. Because CAR-T cells can increase within the body, they have the advantage of requiring only a single administration. In addition, CAR-T cell therapy targeting the CD19 antigen has been established for relapsed or refractory disease in young people with CD19-positive acute B-cell leukemia (B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, B-ALL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In addition to CAR-T cell therapy, oncolytic viruses represent a promising approach for cancer treatment, with some already in clinical use and others being researched for their potential benefits. These viruses infect and kill cancer cells, triggering an immune response that helps the body recognize and fight cancer. Oncolytic virus therapy is a form of immunotherapy that uses modified viruses to target and destroy tumor cells while potentially stimulating antitumor immune responses. These viruses have shown promising activity in clinical trials, with some approved for specific cancers like melanoma. Research is ongoing to improve their efficacy, expand their use to other cancer types, and overcome the logistical challenges associated with their delivery. Gene therapy can potentially treat diseases caused by recessive gene disorders like cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, and sickle cell anemia, as well as acquired genetic diseases, such as cancer and viral infections like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).",0
"The antioxidant activity (radical scavenging and thiocyanate method), total phenolic contents (gallic acid equivalents) and phenolic composition (coulometric array detection) in methanol extracts of different parts and tissue types of hydroponically grown Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris subspecies cycla) were determined. Significant differences (P <0.01) in the antioxidant activity were found between leaves and stems. Phenolic content and composition of the leaves and the stems also were found to be different. A positive linear correlation (R=0.943) was demonstrated between radical scavenging activity and total phenolic content of each extract. The major phenolic acid and flavonoid in leaves of Swiss chard were syringic acid and kaempferol. Coulometric array detection showed good reproducibility (CV, 0.06–1.05%) and sensitivity (1 ng/ml, detection limit) for simultaneous detection of 13 phenolics. Our data indicates that Swiss chard has potential as a good dietary source of phenolic antioxidants.",1
"Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A method is described for their direct determination in different types of wine using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. In a survey of 120 commercial wines from Portugal and France, the highest concentrations of stilbenes were found in red wines. The glucosides of resveratrol were present in higher concentrations than the free isomers. Isolation from wine and characterization of trans-astringin in a large quantity are described for the first time.",1
"Tea is rich in polyphenols and has a variety of biological activities. In order to better understand the biological effects of tea constituents on human health, markers for their exposure and their metabolic fates are needed. Previously, we have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the direct simultaneous analysis of the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols using single sample analysis. This method can also be used for thorough investigations of the metabolite profiles of many other dietary constituents.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in children. Despite cure rates of higher than 85 %, refractory or relapsed ALL still exhibits a bleak prognosis indicative of the dearth of treatment modalities specific for relapsed or refractory ALL. Prior research has implicated metabolic alterations in leukemia pathogenesis, and literature on the therapeutic efficacy of arsenic compounds targeting metabolic pathways in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells is scarce. A compound extracted from realgar, tetraarsenic tetrasulfide (As As Tetraarsenic tetrasulfide can regulate the Warburg effect by controlling HK2 expression, a finding that provides both new mechanistic insight into metabolic alterations and pharmacological evidence for the clinical treatment of B-ALL.",0
"Ponatinib, a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has shown efficacy in Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), including cases with and without BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations. This meta-analysis compares ponatinib with other TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib etc.) in terms of complete molecular response (CMR), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS). A systematic search was conducted across three databases and two clinical trial registries. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for CMR were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method, while hazard ratios (HRs) for OS and EFS were estimated via the inverse variance method. A Bayesian hierarchical model was applied to adjust for biases, providing logOR and logHR estimates. Twelve studies were included. In the uncorrected analysis, ponatinib showed a significant advantage for CMR (OR=2.99; 95 %-CI:2.14-4.18), but this effect was non-significant after bias correction (logOR=0.62; 95 %-CI: -1.17 to 1.35). For OS and EFS, ponatinib demonstrated superior outcomes in both uncorrected [OS: HR= 0.63 (95 %-CI: 0.47-0.83); EFS: HR= 0.62 (95 %-CI: 0.47-0.83)] and bias-corrected analyses [OS: logHR= -1.62 (95 %-CI: -4.02, -0.41); EFS: logHR= -2.94 (95 %-CI: -5.23, -0.58)]. Bias correction indicated an 80.2 % lower risk in OS and a 94.2 % lower risk in EFS with ponatinib. Treatment-related adverse events, reported in six studies, showed no significant differences between ponatinib and other TKIs. Ponatinib is associated with significantly better survival outcomes compared to other TKIs. However, due to limited safety data, future randomized controlled trials are needed to comprehensively evaluate its safety profile relative to other TKIs.",0
"Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants and phenolics during the dice-making process.",1
"Fresh mangos entering the United States must be subjected to a thermal quarantine treatment to eliminate invasive pests, commonly followed by cold storage to extend shelf-life. Changes in phytochemicals and their resultant antioxidant capacity after such treatments are unknown. These studies evaluated mature, green mangos subjected to a simulated quarantine treatment using hot water immersion at 50°C for 60 min and subsequent storage at 5°C and 20°C against their respective controls. Fruit held at 5°C were transferred to 20°C after 8 d of storage to complete ripening, whereby symptoms of chill injury were observed. Phytochemical, antioxidant capacity, and quality parameters were then assessed every 4 d as the fruit ripened over the next 20 d. Storage temperature during ripening and not the hot water treatment was the major factor contributing to changes in polyphenolic content, with antioxidant capacity unaffected by either postharvest treatments or ripening. Major polyphenolics identified were free gallic acid and 4 gallotannins that collectively increased in concentration by 34% as the fruit ripened, also independent of postharvest and storage treatments. Carotenoid concentrations were highest in hot water-treated fruit stored at 20°C, whereas storage at 5°C initially delayed ripening. Despite appreciable differences in fruit quality during quarantine treatment or low temperature storage, only minor differences in antioxidant phytochemicals were observed",1
"Epidemiological data showed that tomato and tomato product (sauce, paste) consumption is associated with a protective effect against the development of some chronic-degenerative diseases. Tomato antioxidant bioactive molecules such as carotenoids and polyphenols could be responsible, at least in part, for the healthy effect observed. The bioavailability of these compounds is an essential requirement to sustain their in vivo role. While it is well known that many factors can influence the bioaccessibility of carotenoids from the food matrix, there is little information about the factors affecting phenolic compounds' bioaccessibility.",1
"Flavonoids, a subclass of polyphenols, are major constituents of many plant-based foods and beverages, including tea, wine and chocolate. Epidemiological studies have shown that a flavonoid-rich diet is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the flavonoids survive intact until they reach the colon where they are then extensively metabolized into smaller fragments. Here, we describe the development of GC-MS-based methods for the profiling of phenolic microbial fermentation products in urine, plasma, and fecal water. Furthermore, the methods are applicable for profiling products obtained from in vitro batch culture fermentation models. The methods incorporate enzymatic deconjugation, liquid-liquid extraction, derivatization, and subsequent analysis by GC-MS. At the level of individual compounds, the methods gave recoveries better than 80% with inter-day precision being better than 20%, depending on the matrix. Limits of detection were below 0.1 microg/ml for most phenolic acids. The newly developed methods were successfully applied to samples from human and in-vitro intervention trials, studying the metabolic impact of flavonoid intake. In conclusion, the methods presented are robust and generally applicable to diverse biological fluids. Its profiling character is useful to investigate on a large scale the gut microbiome-mediated bioavailability of flavonoids.",1
"A method for quantitation of six prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, desmethylxanthohumol, 6- and 8-prenylnaringenins and 6-geranylnaringenin) in hops and beer by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The method allows direct analysis of beer and crude methanolic extracts of hops. After HPLC separation, prenylflavonoids were detected by positive ion multiple-reaction monitoring using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated nebulizer--atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The accuracy and precision were evaluated by replicate analyses of (spiked) samples. Thirteen commercial beers were analysed with the method. Isoxanthohumol, formed by isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process, was the most abundant flavonoid in hopped beers, ranging from 0.04 to 3.44 mg/l.",1
"To investigate the effectiveness of donor-derived chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells in the treatment of relapsed cases after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and whether donor-derived peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) have a therapeutic effect on pancytopenia after CAR-T cell therapy. We analyzed data from five adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had relapse after allo-HSCT and received donor-derived CAR-T cell therapy and donor-derived PBSCs to promote hematopoietic recovery. All patients had negative minimal residual disease after CAR-T therapy, grade 1-2 cytokine release syndrome, and developed grade 4 hematologic toxicity. During the pancytopenia stage after CAR-T cell therapy, donor-derived PBSCs were transfused without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Four patients had grade I-II acute GVHD (aGVHD). After corticosteroid treatment, aGVHD resolved and hematopoiesis was restored. Although steroids in combination with etanercept and ruxolitinib relieved symptoms in one patient with grade IV aGVHD, complete hematopoietic recovery was not achieved, and the patient died due to severe infection. Donor-derived CAR-T cell therapy is safe and effective in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL after allo-HSCT. Donor-derived PBSCs infusion could achieve hematopoietic recovery with controllable aGVHD in patients with persistent pancytopenia.",0
"A HPTLC-densitometric method, based on an external standard approach, was developed in order to obtain a novel procedure for routine analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) in flaxseed with a minimum of sample pre-treatment. Optimization of TLC conditions for the densitometric scanning was reached by eluting HPTLC silica gel plates in a horizontal developing chamber. Quantitation of SDG was performed in single beam reflectance mode by using a computer-controlled densitometric scanner and applying a five-point calibration in the 1.00-10.00 microg/spot range. As no sample preparation was required, the proposed HPTLC-densitometric procedure demonstrated to be reliable, yet using an external standard approach. The proposed method is precise, reproducible and accurate and can be employed profitably in place of HPLC for the determination of SDG in complex matrices.",1
"The synuclein family, consisting of α-, β-, and γ-synuclein, is primarily expressed in neurons. Mutations of α- and β-synuclein have been linked to Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, respectively. Recent studies have shown that synucleins are upregulated in various tumors, including breast, ovarian, meningioma, and melanoma, and high synuclein expression is associated with poor prognosis and drug resistance.

"Phenolic compounds of ten genotypes of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were investigated using four different methods. Assayable tannins using the 0.5% vanillin assay ranged from 49–306 mg catechin equivalents/100 g beans. Significant differences were observed for tannins measured by the vanillin and the protein precipitable phenol tests. Of the two redox assays, the Prussian blue assay gave significantly higher total phenol values than the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Both these reagents were more sensitive to tannic acid than to catechin. Although tannin values varied 2–3 fold for a given variety, excellent correlation was observed between the different assays employed for bean tannin analysis.",1
"The content of ellagic acid was determined from the berries of the family Rosaceae (strawberry, red raspberry, cloudberry, arctic bramble). Extraction and hydrolysis procedures were optimized and analysis was done with an HPLC method and UV detection. The influence of processing on ellagic acid content was studied in strawberry jam. Strawberries, red raspberries, and strawberry jam were analyzed fresh and after 3, 6, and 9 months of storage in a domestic freezer or refrigerator. Ellagic acid contents after 3 months of storage at −20 °C varied between 31.5 (strawberry ‘Senga Sengana’) and 68.6 mg/100 g f.w. (arctic bramble). Ellagic acid content in strawberry jam (23.8 mg/100 g f.w.) was 80% of that in unprocessed strawberries. The content of ellagic acid in strawberries and red raspberries was reduced by 40% and 30%, respectively, during the 9 months of storage at −20°C. The unprocessed berries studied, together with nuts, make the main contribution to the total dietary intake of ellagic acid in Finland.",1
"Nobiletin, a major component of citrus polymethoxyflavones, has many potential significant health benefits. While the biological activities of nobiletin have been widely reported, its in vitro and in vivo metabolic fate has been rarely studied. To explore the biotransformation mechanism of nobiletin we conducted an investigation into its metabolic profile in mouse urine, by various analytical techniques. Due to sample amount limitations for isolating and characterizing an individual metabolite, two possible nobiletin metabolites were prepared in a similar multi-step organic synthetic route: 3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (3'-demethylnobiletin) and 4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxyflavone (4'-demethylnobiletin). Normal phase (silica gel) and C(18) reverse phase chromatography, as well as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry, were employed in the separation of 3'-demethylnobiletin and 4'-demethylnobiletin, however, without success due to the structural similarities of these mono-demethylated nobiletins. Using a chiral packed column eluted under supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) conditions, a clear separation was achieved. Thus, by comparing the SFC profiles of metabolite mixtures with the synthesized standard compounds, the major nobiletin metabolite of mouse urine is identified as 4'-demethylnobiletin, whereas 3'-demethylnobiletin is a minor metabolite. In this study, the concentration of 4'-demethylnobiletin in mouse urine is 28.9 microg/mL.",1
"Genomic profiling during the diagnosis of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) in adults is used to guide disease classification, risk stratification, and treatment decisions. Patients for whom diagnostic screening fails to identify disease-defining or risk-stratifying lesions are classified as having B-other ALL. We screened a cohort of 652 BCP-ALL cases enrolled in UKALL14 to identify and perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) of paired tumor-normal samples. For 52 patients with B-other, we compared the WGS findings with data from clinical and research cytogenetics. WGS identified a cancer-associated event in 51 of 52 patients, including an established subtype defining genetic alterations that were previously missed with standard-of-care (SoC) genetics in 5 of them. Of the 47 true B-other ALL, we identified a recurrent driver in 87% (41). A complex karyotype via cytogenetics emerges as a heterogeneous group, including distinct genetic alterations associated with either favorable (DUX4-r) or poor outcomes (MEF2D-r and IGK::BCL2). For a subset of 31 cases, we integrated the findings from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to include fusion gene detection and classification based on gene expression. Compared with RNA-seq, WGS was sufficient to detect and resolve recurrent genetic subtypes; however, RNA-seq can provide orthogonal validation of findings. In conclusion, we demonstrated that WGS can identify clinically relevant genetic abnormalities missed with SoC testing as well as identify leukemia driver events in virtually all cases of B-other ALL.",0

"A reversed‐phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP‐HPLC) separation system with diode array detector (DAD) was used to determine and quantify 21 flavonoids as aglycones and glycosides from five major flavonoid types (anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanones, flavones, and catechins). The flavonoids were determined in freeze‐dried samples of fruit and vegetables. Identification of particular flavonoids in real samples was carried out by standard addition method and by comparing absorption spectra.",1
"Existing literature on febrile neutropenia (FN) has categorized patients with acute leukemia or those undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) as being high risk for severe infection, bacteremia, and poor outcomes. Comprehensive studies of infection risk in pediatric high-risk neuroblastoma (NB-HR) during induction chemotherapy are limited, and mostly merged within the solid tumor (ST) group. Therefore, it is unclear whether infectious complications and outcomes for NB-HR are the same as in other ST groups. We conducted a retrospective medical record review of pediatric FN patients in a single center from March 2009 to December 2016. FN episodes were categorized into five groups based on underlying diagnosis (acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), NB-HR during induction chemotherapy, other solid tumors, and SCT). Comparative analyses of infectious complications between patients with NB-HR and those with other types of cancer diagnoses were performed. A total of 667 FN episodes (FNEs) were identified in 230 patients. FNEs occurred in 82 episodes with NB-HR. Bloodstream infection (BSI) occurred in 145 (21.7%) of total FN episodes. The most isolated organisms were the viridians group streptococci (VGS) (25%). NB-HR patients have higher rates of VGS bacteremia (OR 0.15, 95% [CI 0.04, 0.56]) and are more likely to be admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) compared to patients with other solid tumors (OR 0.36, 95% [CI 0.15, 0.84]). Interestingly, there is no difference in VGS rates between patients with NB-HR and those with AML despite the fact that NB-HR patients do not receive a cytosine arabinoside (AraC)-based regimen. This large neuroblastoma cohort showed that patients with NB-HR during induction chemotherapy are at higher risk for VGS bacteremia and PICU admissions compared with patients with other solid tumors. Further prospective studies are needed to investigate infection-related complications in this high-risk group and to improve morbidity and mortality.",0
"The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Patients on dasatinib can rarely develop a form of benign reversible reactive lymphadenopathy termed follicular lymphoid hyperplasia (FLH). Here, we describe a patient with Ph+ ALL who developed follicular lymphoma (FL) after prolonged treatment with dasatinib and who had complete remission of FL after discontinuation of dasatinib. This case suggests that dasatinib-associated FLH could be a premalignant condition that can transform into FL. Moreover, withdrawal of dasatinib may be sufficient for remission of dasatinib-associated FL.",0
"Distinct diagnostic entities within BCR::ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are currently defined by the International Consensus Classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias (ICC): ""lymphoid only"", with BCR::ABL1 observed exclusively in lymphatic precursors, vs ""multilineage"", where BCR::ABL1 is also present in other hematopoietic lineages. Here, we analyzed transcriptomes of 327 BCR::ABL1-positive patients with ALL (age, 2-84 years; median, 46 years) and identified 2 main gene expression clusters reproducible across 4 independent patient cohorts. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of fluorescence-activated cell-sorted hematopoietic compartments showed distinct BCR::ABL1 involvement in myeloid cells for these clusters (n = 18/18 vs n = 3/16 patients; P < .001), indicating that a multilineage or lymphoid BCR::ABL1 subtype can be inferred from gene expression. Further subclusters grouped samples according to cooperating genomic events (multilineage: HBS1L deletion or monosomy 7; lymphoid: IKZF1-/- or CDKN2A/PAX5 deletions/hyperdiploidy). A novel HSB1L transcript was highly specific for BCR::ABL1 multilineage cases independent of HBS1L genomic aberrations. Treatment on current German Multicenter Study Group for Adult ALL (GMALL) protocols resulted in comparable disease-free survival (DFS) for multilineage vs lymphoid cluster patients (3-year DFS: 70% vs 61%; P = .530; n = 91). However, the IKZF1-/- enriched lymphoid subcluster was associated with inferior DFS, whereas hyperdiploid cases showed a superior outcome. Thus, gene expression clusters define underlying developmental trajectories and distinct patterns of cooperating events in BCR::ABL1-positive ALL with prognostic relevance.",0
"Three monovarietal virgin olive oils obtained from olives grown under biological agricultural system, in Portugal, with different ripening stages, were studied in what concerns the parameters usually related with oxidation status (total polyphenols, tocopherols, chlorophylls and carotenoids, peroxide values, oxidative stability, specific extinction coefficients K232 and K270 and titratable acidity). A total of 18 samples were analyzed: seven from Cv. Cobrançosa (maturation indices 1–7), five from Cv. Madural (maturation indices 3–7) and six from Cv. Verdeal Transmontana (maturation indices 1–6). Oxidative stability and polyphenols profile presented high correlation coefficients. Given this high correlation, a numerical method was developed and evaluated to predict total polyphenols contents in olive oil. The method is based on the kinetic equation of the oxidation process in the presence of antioxidants and on Rancimat profiles. Total polyphenols contents obtained with this method were similar to those obtained by the Folin-Ciocalteau method.",1
"ETV6::ACSL6 represents a rare genetic aberration in hematopoietic neoplasms and is often associated with severe eosinophilia, which confers an unfavorable prognosis requiring additional anti-inflammatory treatment. However, since the translocation is unlikely to produce a fusion protein, the mechanism of ETV6::ACSL6 action remains unclear. Here, we performed multi-omics analyses of primary leukemia cells and patient-derived xenografts from an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient with ETV6::ACSL6 translocation. We identified a super-enhancer located within the ETV6 gene locus, and revealed translocation and activation of the super-enhancer associated with the ETV6::ACSL6 fusion. The translocated super-enhancer exhibited intense interactions with genomic regions adjacent to and distal from the breakpoint at chromosomes 5 and 12, including genes coding inflammatory factors such as IL-3. This led to modulations in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structures, triggering transcription of inflammatory factors leading to eosinophilia. Furthermore, the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor synergized with standard-of-care drugs for ALL, effectively reducing IL-3 expression and inhibiting ETV6::ACSL6 ALL growth in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our study revealed for the first time a cis-regulatory mechanism of super-enhancer translocation in ETV6::ACSL6ALL, leading to an ALL-accompanying clinical syndrome. These findings may stimulate novel treatment approaches for this challenging ALL subtype.",0
"Hydroxylated stilbene contents of a number of commercial American red wines were determined by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry. Six stilbenols were eluted. Two of these were identified as cis and trans isomers of 3,5,4‘-trihydroxystilbene (resveratrol), while the others were tentatively identified as mono-, di-, tri-, and tetrahydroxystilbenes. cis- and trans-resveratrol were present in the wines at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 31.9 ppm for cis and from 0.0 to 13.4 ppm for trans. The concentrations of resveratrol in wines made from Vitis rotundifolia (muscadine) grapes were higher (P > 0.05) than those present in wines made from Vitis vinifera and Vitis labruscana grapes. Tetrahydroxy contents of Muscadine and Concord wine were, in general, lower than that of the V. vinifera wines. A method for analyzing hydroxylated stilbene compounds in wine by flame ionization detection is reported.",1
"Blinatumomab and inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) are B-cell targeted agents used in the frontline and relapsed/refractory treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager that targets CD19 and CD3, and InO, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting CD22, have both shown efficacy. However, recent reports have noted lineage conversion as a complication when these agents are used individually or sequentially. We present a rare case of this phenomenon in a 79-year-old male patient. A 79-year-old male with refractory B-ALL underwent a lineage switch to acute myeloid leukaemia following treatment with blinatumomab and InO. The patient initially achieved remission after initial therapy but relapsed and was subsequently treated with blinatumomab. Due to adverse effects, the treatment was discontinued. He was then treated with InO but again relapsed. A subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed morphologic evidence of residual B-ALL, but with the presence of acute monocytic leukaemia. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis demonstrated an additional copy of KMT2A in a large percentage of cells which was a feature present since the initial diagnosis. Unfortunately, the patient's condition deteriorated, and he died. This case underscores potential complication of lineage switch following treatment with B-cell directed therapies. Although such therapies have improved outcomes in B-cell malignancies, clinicians should remain aware of rare risks such as lineage transformation. Timely recognition is essential to guide appropriate clinical management. Lineage switch is a rare complication observed after B-cell targeted therapies; however, evidence remains limited.Specific genetic alterations, such as KMT2A abnormalities, may predispose leukemic clones to lineage plasticity.Close monitoring for immunophenotypic evolution is essential for timely recognition and clinical management of lineage switch.",0
"Seven varietal port wine grapes (Tinta Roriz, Tinta Barroca, Tinta Amarela, Tinta Cão, Touriga Francesa, Touriga Nacional and Rufete) were analysed in order to determine differences in flavonol compositions. For this purpose, a SPE-HPLC method was applied. Although no qualitative variations were found, there are quantitative differences in the individual concentrations of the phenolic compounds. In Tinta Cão and Rufete varieties, (−)-epicatechin was the major compound. All samples showed significant amounts of kaempferol 3-glucoside and isorhamnetin 3-glucoside, with the exception of Rufete variety, where these compounds were present in traces.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common cancer affecting children worldwide, and current treatment has adverse effects such as neurotoxicity. To overcome this problem, new organotin (IV) dithiocarbamate compounds were synthesized. In this study, the T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (CCL-119) was tested against seven new compounds: diphenyltin (IV) diisopropyl dithiocarbamate (ODTC 1), diphenyltin (IV) diallyl dithiocarbamate (ODTC 2), triphenyltin (IV) diisopropyl dithiocarbamate (ODTC 3), triphenyltin (IV) diallyl dithiocarbamate (ODTC 4), triphenyltin (IV) diethyl dithiocarbamate (ODTC 5), dimethyltin (IV) diisopropyl dithiocarbamate (ODTC 6) and dimethyltin (IV) diethyl dithiocarbamate (ODTC 7) hereafter referred to as ODTC 1-7, to identify their cytotoxic effects (MTT assay), mode of cell death (Annexin V FITC/PI staining) and effects on the cell cycle (RNase/PI staining) as well as genotoxic effects (alkaline comet assay). Results obtained after 24 hours of exposure showed that all organotin (IV) dithiocarbamate compounds (ODTC 1-7) exhibited potent cytotoxicity, with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 0.18 µM to 3.10 µM. The selectivity index showed that diphenyltin (IV) and triphenyltin (IV) dithiocarbamate compounds are more selective towards CCL-119 cells. All ODTC compounds induced apoptosis in CCL-119 cells, and each compound caused cell cycle arrest at specific phases, indicating diverse mechanisms of action. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were confirmed by flow cytometry. Treatment of the compounds caused significant (p < 0.05) DNA damage compared to the negative control, with ODTC 1 causing the highest genotoxic effects. In conclusion, diphenyltin (IV) and triphenyltin (IV) dithiocarbamate compounds show good potential as anti-leukemia agents. However, further studies on the mechanisms of action need to be conducted to have better insights into the effect of this compound on CCL-119 leukemia cells.",0
"Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.",1
"In addition to soya-derived preparations, red clover-based dietary supplements have gained considerable interest as an alternative isoflavone (IF) source. While metabolism and bioavailability of the main IF from both sources have already been investigated, studies are still lacking on the biokinetic behaviour of IF, which are present in red clover in minor amounts. In the present pilot study, in which seven volunteers ingested a single dose of a commercial red clover dietary supplement, we focused on the absorption of three such IF, irilone (IRI), prunetin (PRUN) and pseudobaptigenin (PBAP). The compounds were measured as aglycones after enzymatic hydrolysis. A single intake of an amount of as low as 3.8 mg IRI (out of 38.8 mg IF in total) resulted in an IRI plasma concentration of 0.35 (sd 0.16) mum at 6.5 h post-ingestion. Compared to the plasma concentrations found for daidzein (0.39 mum) and genistein (0.06 mum), expected to be the main IF metabolites in plasma, the present findings indicate that IRI might possess a relatively high bioavailability. Furthermore, PRUN and PBAP were detected in human plasma for the first time.",1
"Whole grain products are recommended for healthy diets as being recognized sources of dietary fiber and antioxidant substances. In the present study, four cereals including barley, pearl millet, rye and sorghum which are adapted to the growing conditions in the United Arab Emirates were evaluated in terms of their composition of dietary fiber, resistant starch, minerals and total phenols and antioxidant properties. Antioxidant activity was evaluated on the basis of scavenging capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate] (ABTS+ radical cations). The adapted grains exhibited better nutritional quality compared to commercial hard and soft wheat flours, the main ingredients in grain-based food products. They were significantly rich in resistant starch, soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, minerals and antioxidants. Barley had the highest levels of phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, copper, and zinc, and the second highest content of iron following millet. Sorghum was exceptionally high in antioxidant activities followed by millet and barley. The antioxidant properties of the three grains were comparable to butylated hydroxytoluene. The nutritional data suggest that the selected grains, particularly barley and sorghum, hold promise as healthy food ingredients.",1
"Seven healthy females and six males consumed daily 256 mg of vitamin C, 271 mg of flavanones (mainly as glycosides), 6 mg of carotenoids (mainly xanthophylls and cryptoxanthins), and 0.16 mg of folate by incorporation of daily three times 236 mL of not from concentrate orange juice (OJ) into their habitual diet. At the end of 3 weeks, mean vitamin C, folate, carotenoid, and flavanone plasma concentrations increased significantly relative to baseline by 59% (p < 0.001), 46% (p = 0.018), and 22% (p < 0.001), and 8-fold (p = 0.045), respectively. Flavanones were excreted in urine 9-fold more at the end of the intervention (p = 0.01) but returned to baseline 2 days after study completion. After the 3 week intervention, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E did not change. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine in white blood cells declined by 16% (p = 0.38; n = 11), and in individuals with high baseline concentrations by 29% (p = 0.36; n = 7), respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratios decreased but cholesterol (HDL, LDL, total) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance plasma concentrations did not change significantly. We conclude from this pilot study that OJ is an excellent food source to enhance circulating concentrations of valuable hydrophilic as well as lipophilic phytochemicals.",1
"The composition and content of flavonol glycosides (FGs) have been measured in infusions of a range of black tea and black tea products. Tea contains a mixture of glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin and the total level of these glycosides, in infusions prepared in a normal domestic manner, for the leaf teas varied from 36.5 to 88.3 mg/L, although greater variation was observed for the tea products, from 7.0 to 428.1 mg/L. Altogether seven quercetin, five kaempferol, and two myricetin glycosides were detected; their relative amounts varied significantly in the different samples. The significance of these differences in relation to the bioavailability and potential bioactivity of these compounds is discussed.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer, with survivors frequently experiencing long-term neurocognitive morbidities. Here, we utilize the TOTXVI clinical trial data to elucidate the mechanisms underlying treatment-related neurocognitive side effects in pediatric ALL patients by incorporating brain connectivity network data. To enable such analysis, we propose a high-dimensional mediation analysis method with a novel network mediation structural shrinkage (NMSS) prior, which is particularly suited for analyzing high-dimensional brain structural connectivity network data that serve as mediators. Our method is capable of addressing the structural dependencies of brain connectivity networks including sparsity, effective degrees of nodes, and modularity, yielding accurate estimates of the high-dimensional coefficients and mediation effects. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed NMSS method through simulation studies and apply it to the TOTXVI data, revealing significant mediation effects of brain connectivity on visual processing speed directed by IT intensity. The findings shed light on the potential of targeted interventions to mitigate neurocognitive deficits in pediatric ALL survivors.",0
"Antioxidant properties and changes in the levels of active compounds in fresh and processed broad beans were determined in the study. Activity of extracted substances was much higher against ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid]) than towards DPPH (2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals. Phenolics extracted with 70% acetone were also more active comparing to amine compounds obtained with water both in experiments applying radicals and during oxidation of linoleic acid. Steam cooking and freezing had a negative influence on the content of polyphenols and in consequence on their activity. Cooking fresh broad beans decreased the content of those compounds by 16% and freezing – by over 30%, while cooking frozen material resulted in a much lower further decrease (2–8%). Processes applied on fresh material reduced the activity against ABTS•+ to a smaller extent (cooking by 11% and freezing by around 20%), while cooking frozen beans caused a further decrease by 10–17%.",1
"Ninety-four samples of Asturian natural cider were analyzed for titratable and volatile acidities, pH, alcoholic, total polyphenol, and acidic polysaccharide contents, nonvolatile acids, polyalcohols, residual sugars, and major volatile compounds. A partial least-squares regression analysis (PLR-1) was performed to correlate the chemical composition and the origin of the raw material, the cider samples being grouped into two categories: an ""odd"" class, cider made from foreign apples (1995 and 1997), and an ""even"" class, ciders made from Asturian apples (1996 and 1998). The mathematical model has a multiple linear correlation coefficient of 80%.",1
"B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is characterized by the highly heterogeneity of pathogenic genetic background, and there are still approximately 30-40% of patients without clear molecular markers. To identify the dysregulated genes in B cell ALL, we screened 30 newly diagnosed B cell ALL patients and 10 donors by gene expression profiling chip. We found that ECM1 transcription level was abnormally elevated in newly diagnosed B cell ALL and further verified in another 267 cases compared with donors (median, 124.57% vs. 7.14%, P < 0.001). ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve of ECM1 transcription level at diagnosis was 0.89 (P < 0.001). Patients with BCR::ABL1 and IKZF1 deletion show highest transcription level (210.78%) compared with KMT2A rearrangement (39.48%) and TCF3::PBX1 rearrangement ones (30.02%) (all P < 0.05). Also, the transcription level of ECM1 was highly correlated with the clinical course, as 20 consecutive follow-up cases indicated. The 5-year OS of patients (non-KMT2A and non-TCF3::PBX1 rearrangement) with high ECM1 transcription level was significantly worse than the lower ones (18.7% vs. 72.9%, P < 0.001) and high ECM1 transcription level was an independent risk factor for OS (HR = 5.77 [1.75-19.06], P = 0.004). After considering transplantation, high ECM1 transcription level was not an independent risk factor, although OS was still poor (low vs. high, 71.1% vs. 56.8%, P = 0.038). Our findings suggested that ECM1 may be a potential molecular marker for diagnosis, minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, and prognosis prediction of B cell ALL.Trial registration Trial Registration Registered in the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau Registration N 2007-1007 and in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry [ChiCTR-OCH-10000940 and ChiCTR-OPC-14005546]; http://www.chictr.org.cn .",0
"A 26-year-old male complained of fever, right neck swelling, anorexia, and weight loss for 4 months. The patient noticed a right swelling in the root of the neck that progressed from 1 × 1 cm to 5 × 6 cm. We reported a Kikuchi-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) case. Three 3 × 3 cm lymph nodes were found in the right cervical area at IIB and III levels, firm, mobile, and nontender. Petechiae and purpura on the left upper limb, wet purpura on the palate, a positive Hess test, and temperature spikes were present. The patient is responding well to ALL treatment.",0
"Sudden unexpected death due to haematologic disease in children is unusual. A 3-year-old girl had been ill for several weeks, but her parents did not consult a doctor. Her complaints included a cough, fever, vomiting and fatigue. On the day of her death, the girl fell from the toilet and was unresponsive. In hospital, severe dyspnoea and a haemoglobin value of only 1.7 mg/dl were diagnosed, as well as hypothermia and haemorrhaging from mouth and nose. Despite intensive medical care and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the girl died. Main autopsy findings were severe anaemia and the underlying disease, B-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia (B-ALL). In particular, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, kidneys and bone marrow showed marked infiltration of atypical mononuclear cells replacing haematopoiesis. Intra-alveolar exudation, consistent with the early phase of acute pneumonia, was identified as cause of death. Toxicological investigations revealed positive findings of morphine (53.3 ng/ml), as well as amphetamine and THC in femoral blood, respectively, in hair samples. This paper discusses the medicolegal implications of the case (omitted duty of care by the parents).",0
"Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 % w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order to prevent chronic diseases.",1
"Asparaginase is a cornerstone of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy, but treatment discontinuation due to toxicity may increase relapse risk and compromise outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 993 pediatric ALL patients (aged 1.0-17.9 years) treated under the CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol from May 2015 to October 2020. Patients were followed from the last administered asparaginase dose until relapse, death, secondary malignancy (SMN), or end of follow-up (median: 6.0 years). Asparaginase was truncated in 40 (4.0%) patients, primarily due to hypersensitivity or pancreatitis. Compared to non-truncated patients (n = 953), truncated patients had a higher 6-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR: 31.5% vs. 17.5%, HR: 2.01, P = .038), as well as inferior event-free survival (EFS) (HR: 2.11, P = .015) and overall survival (OS) (HR: 2.74, P = .046). CIR was also significantly higher among patients receiving < 53% of planned asparaginase doses (32.1% vs. 14.0%, HR: 2.71, P = .004). In intermediate-risk subgroup, truncation was associated with significantly reduced EFS (HR: 1.95, P = .046). Older age (≥ 10 years), higher MRD levels (day 19 ≥ 0.1%), and higher asparaginase exposure percentage were predictors of discontinuation. In conclusion, asparaginase discontinuation is associated with inferior outcomes, emphasizing the importance of replacement with alternative formulations to maintain treatment intensity.",0
"Thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein (TOX) and members of the nuclear receptor 4A (NR4A) are known as transcription factors involved in T cell exhaustion. To evaluate the mRNA expression of TOX and NR4A1-3 in CD8+ T cells in acute leukemia. Blood samples were obtained from 21 ALL and 6 AML patients as well as 20 control subjects. CD8+ T cells were isolated using MACS. Relative gene expression of TOX and NR4A1-3 was then evaluated using qRT-PCR. Comparison of mRNA expression of TOX in CD8+ T cells showed no significant difference among the study groups (p>0.05), while the expression of NR4A1 was significantly lower in AML patients than in the control group (p=0.0006). Also, the expression of NR4A2 and NR4A3 was significantly lower in both ALL (p=0.0049 and p=0.0005, respectively) and AML (p=0.0019 and p=0.0055, respectively) patients. NR4As expressions were found to be lower in CD8+ T cells from patients with AML and ALL compared to controls, whereas the mRNA expression of TOX showed no significant difference. Although TOX and NR4As are associated with CD8+ T cell exhaustion in solid tumors, they might play different roles in acute leukemia, which requires further investigation.",0
"To perform an updated systematic review on the prevalence and morphological characteristics of the anterolateral ligament (ALL) in human cadaveric specimens. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for studies from 2012 to 2024 describing morphology. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and Quality Appraisal for Cadaveric Studies scale. Heterogeneity was analyzed with the I Thirty studies were included. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme identified 3 low-quality studies. Twelve studies met the Quality Appraisal for Cadaveric Studies quality threshold. The prevalence of the ALL was 61.7% (82% in North America, 64.9% in Europe, and 45.8% in Asia). The femoral insertion showed variability near the lateral femoral epicondyle and lateral collateral ligament, while the tibial insertion was midway between Gerdy's tubercle and fibular head. Histological analysis revealed 60% of studies identified ligamentous tissue similar to the anterior cruciate ligament. The mean ALL length was 39.7 mm, width 5.5 mm, and thickness 1.5 mm, with no significant morphological differences among populations. This systematic review reveals that the ALL is present in 61.7%, with prevalence rates of 82% in North American studies, 65% in European studies, and 46% in Asian studies. The femoral insertion exhibited substantial variability at/around the lateral femoral epicondyle and lateral collateral ligament, lacking consistency. The tibial insertion was more consistently described as being located about halfway between Gerdy's tubercle and the fibular head. Histological analysis showed that 60% of the included studies identified the ALL as containing ligament-like or ligamentous tissue. The mean length of the ALL was 39.9 mm (range 31-59 mm), the mean width was 5.7 mm (range 2.2-9.0 mm), and the mean thickness was 1.5 mm (range 1.3-2.7 mm). No significant ethnic population differences were observed in morphological measures. The ALL is not consistently present in all patients with knee instability, and the indications for performing an ALL reconstruction or lateral tenodesis remain unclear based solely on morphological factors. As a result, the decision to perform these procedures may need to be made on an individualized basis.",0
"The contribution of each phytochemical to the total antioxidant capacity of apples was determined. Major phenolic phytochemicals of six apple cultivars were identified and quantified, and their contributions to total antioxidant activity of apples were determined using a 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay and expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). Average concentrations of major phenolics and vitamin C in six apple cultivars were as follows (mg/100 g of fresh weight of apples): quercetin glycosides, 13.20; procyanidin B(2), 9.35; chlorogenic acid, 9.02; epicatechin, 8.65; phloretin glycosides, 5.59; vitamin C, 12.80. A highly linear relationship (r (2) > 0.97) was attained between concentrations and total antioxidant capacity of phenolics and vitamin C. Relative VCEAC values of these compounds were in the order quercetin (3.06) > epicatechin (2.67) > procyanidin B(2) (2.36) > phloretin (1.63) > vitamin C (1.00) > chlorogenic acid (0.97). Therefore, the estimated contribution of major phenolics and vitamin C to the total antioxidant capacity of 100 g of fresh apples is as follows: quercetin (40.39 VCEAC) > epicatechin (23.10) > procyanidin B(2) (22.07) > vitamin C (12.80) > phloretin (9.11) > chlorogenic acid (8.75). These results indicate that flavonoids such as quercetin, epicatechin, and procyanidin B(2) rather than vitamin C contribute significantly to the total antioxidant activity of apples.",1
"Five different bean varieties (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) from Kenya, which were obtained either freshly collected or after having been stored for 5 years in tropical conditions (30−40 °C, >75% RH), were compared for their cooking characteristics. Beans under storage were susceptible to the hard-to-cook (HTC) defect, and the bean cooking time was up to 12 times that of the fresh beans, limiting their acceptability. A study was undertaken to investigate changes in nutritionally relevant physicochemical properties of beans during storage. Chemical analysis showed that storage resulted in a decrease in pH and an increase in titratable acidity in all varieties. Total polyphenol, non-tannin polyphenol, tannin, and lignin contents were determined; storage-induced HTC beans contained lower levels of total polyphenols (especially, non-tannin polyphenols) than the fresh beans but higher levels of tannins in all cultivars. Significant increases in lignin and lignified protein were also detected and accompanied by increases in cooking time. A reduction in phytic acid was also observed. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanisms which may underlie the development of the HTC defect.",1
"Dietary fibers, major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements in persimmons and apples were analyzed and compared in order to choose a preferable fruit for an antiatherosclerotic diet. Fluorometry and atomic absorption spectrometry following microwave digestion were optimized for the determination of major phenolics and minerals. Total, soluble, and insoluble dietary fibers, total phenols, epicatechin, gallic and p-coumaric acids, and concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Fe, and Mn in whole persimmons, their pulps, and peels were significantly higher than in whole apples, pulps, and peels (P < 0.01-0.0025). Conversely, the contents of Cu and Zn were higher in apples than in persimmons. In persimmons and apples all of the above components were higher in their peels than in whole fruits and pulps. The relatively high contents of dietary fibers, total and major phenolics, main minerals, and trace elements make persimmon preferable for an antiatherosclerotic diet.",1
"TP53-mutant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults is a high-risk subtype with poor outcomes, yet its molecular landscape and clinical implications remain incompletely defined. In this multi-institutional study of 830 adult ALL patients treated at eight academic centers between 2010 and 2024, we demonstrated that TP53 mutations are independent predictors of inferior overall survival in both B-ALL (median, 1.9 vs 5 years) and T-ALL (1.6 vs 9.5 years), irrespective of age, biologic disease subtype, or therapy. Genomic profiling revealed that >90% of TP53 mutations were DNA-binding domain missense variants, frequently co-occurring with hypodiploidy in B-ALL and NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutations in T-ALL. Unlike myeloid malignancies, biallelic TP53 mutations did not worsen outcomes, and variant type (missense vs truncating) did not influence survival. TP53-mutant B-ALL exhibited higher CD20 positivity than TP53-wild type B-ALL (65% vs 31%) but had inferior responses to conventional chemotherapy. Novel immunotherapies (e.g., inotuzumab/blinatumomab) or venetoclax-containing combination regimens improved remission rates, yet relapses were common, often with CD19/CD20/CD22 loss (triple-negative) or acquisition of new mutations. Allogeneic transplantation in first remission trended toward survival benefit (median, 3.3 vs 2.2 years). These findings underscore TP53-mutant ALL as a distinct, chemo-resistant entity necessitating tailored approaches, with antigen escape highlighting challenges of immunotherapy durability.",0
"A rapid, simple and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay of naringin in grapefruit juice, without extraction, was developed. A Spherisorb C18 reversed-phase column (4.6 mm i.d. × 250 mm; 10 μm) was used. Separation of naringin and the internal standard (rutin) was achieved with a mobile phase consisting of methanol and water (38:62, v/v, pH3) at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. UV detection was at 280 nm. Samples were prepared by adding 200 μL cold methanol containing 2 mg mL−1 internal standard to 100 μL grapefruit juice. After brief vortexing and centrifugation, the clear supernatant (25 μL) was injected onto the HPLC column. The detection limit of sensitivity was 2.5 mg L−1. The intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 3%.",1
"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and anterolateral ligament (ALL) injuries frequently coexist and contribute to residual rotational instability after isolated ACL reconstruction. Although several combined reconstruction techniques using hamstring or patellar tendons have been described, they often involve multiple tunnels and complex graft preparation. This Technical Note presents a reproducible technique for combined ACL and ALL reconstruction using a single rectus femoris tendon autograft prepared in GraftLink configuration. The graft is secured with ACL TightRope II suspensory fixation using a single femoral tunnel for both ligaments. This approach offers strong graft integrity, minimizes tunnel convergence, and is applicable in both primary and revision surgeries.",0
"Green tea cateachins (GTC). namely (−) epicatechin (EC), (−) epicatechin gallate (ECG), (−) epigallocatechin (EGC), and (−) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), have been studied extensively for their wide-ranging biological activities. The goal of the present study was to examine the stability of GTC as a mixture under various processing conditions. The stability study demonstrated that GTC was stable in water at room temperature. When it was brewed at 98 °C for 7 h, longjing GTC degraded by 20%. When longjing GTC and pure EGCG were autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min, the epimerization of EGCG to (−) gallocatechin gallate (GCG) was observed. The relatively high amount of GCG found in some tea drinks was most likely the epimerization product of EGCG during autoclaving. If other ingredients were absent, the GTC in aqueous solutions was pH-sensitive:  the lower the pH, the more stable the GTC during storage. When it was added into commercially available soft drinks or sucrose solutions containing citric acid and ascorbic acid, longjing GTC exhibited varying stability irrespective of low pH value. This suggested that other ingredients used in production of tea drinks might interact with GTC and affect its stability. When canned and bottled tea drinks are produced, stored, and transported, the degradation of GTC must be taken into consideration.",1
"Indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferation (iT-LBP) is a rare, non-clonal, extrathymic lymphoid proliferation with an immature T cell phenotype, indolent clinical course, and excellent prognosis. Although their pathogenesis is unclear, they are reported to be associated with Castleman disease, follicular dendritic cell tumors/sarcomas, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), myasthenia gravis, and acinic cell carcinoma. There are around 51 reported cases of iT-LBP in the literature. Recognition and accurate diagnosis of this entity is critical as it shares morphologic and immunophenotypic features with an aggressive malignancy-acute T cell leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL). IT-LBP in HCC post-liver transplant and in metastatic sites has not been reported in the literature. Two case reports of patients presenting with recurrent and metastatic HCC in post-liver transplant settings are described. A 50-year-old man with an end-stage liver disease with HCC underwent liver transplant. A year later, he developed pulmonary metastasis with associated iT-LBP. A 69-year-old man underwent liver transplant for end-stage liver disease and HCC. Eighteen months later, he developed recurrent HCC in the transplanted liver and omental metastasis; both sites showed HCC with iT-LBP. iT-LBP in both patients expressed TdT, CD3, and CD4 and lacked CD34 and clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements. On retrospective review, the pre-transplant HCC specimens lacked iT-LBP. We present two cases of iT-LBP associated with HCC in novel settings-in post-liver transplant patients and in recurrent/metastatic sites of HCC. In addition, a comprehensive literature review of clinical, histological, and immunophenotypic characteristics of reported cases of iT-LBP is presented.",0

"Hard-to-cook (HTC) is a textural defect that affects legume seeds stored in adverse conditions. Phenolic acids were extracted from dehulled soft (control) and HTC beans. HPLC analyses of the phenolic fractions indicated the presence of caffeic, p-coumaric, sinapic, and ferulic acids. The highest content of phenolic acids was present as methanol-soluble esters in the control samples (approximately 45 times more than in HTC). Phenolic acids bound to the water-soluble pectin fraction were 2 times higher in HTC than in control beans, wheras the content of ferulic acid bound to the water-insoluble residue of the cell walls was 4 times higher in the control than in HTC samples. Through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy accumulation of pectates and binding of phenolics to cell wall components were detected in HTC samples.",1
"The capacity for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair plays a pivotal role in maintaining genome stability and in carcinogenesis. However, there is little literature on the involvement of NHEJ-related genes in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Our study aimed to elucidate the impact of polymorphisms of X-ray repair cross-complementing group 4 (XRCC4) (rs6869366, rs2075685, rs2075686, rs28360071, rs3734091, rs28360317, rs1805377), XRCC5 (rs828907, rs11685387, rs9288518), XRCC6 (rs5751129, rs2267437, rs132770, rs132774), XRCC7 rs7003908, and DNA ligase IV (LIG4) rs1805388, on the odds of childhood ALL. Genotypes NHEJ-related genes of 266 cases and 266 controls were determined, and the genotype-phenotype correlation was investigated by examining mRNA transcript expression and the capacity for overall and precise NHEJ repair. The variant genotypes of XRCC4 rs3734091, rs28360071, XRCC5 rs828907, and XRCC6 rs5751129 were significantly associated with increased odds of childhood ALL. Further analysis based on susceptibility genotypes showed no significant differences in mRNA transcript expression levels among childhood ALL cases with various putative high-risk genotypes, except XRCC6 rs5751129. Moreover, the overall NHEJ repair capacity was similar among carriers of different XRCC4, XRCC5, and XRCC6 genotypes. However, it is worth noting that individuals carrying the variant C allele at XRCC6 rs5751129 exhibited lower precise NHEJ repair capacity compared to those with the wild-type T allele. Our study identified significant associations between XRCC4 rs3734091, rs28360071, XRCC5 rs828907, and XRCC6 rs5751129 genotypes and childhood ALL. Notably, lower transcriptional expression and reduced precise NHEJ repair capacity were observed in patients carrying the C allele of XRCC6 rs5751129. Further investigations are required to gain deeper insights into childhood ALL development.",0
"The contents of vitamin C, total phenolics, anthocyanins, hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids as well as 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) monocation radical scavenging activity were evaluated in two varieties of red cabbage before and after conventional and steam-cooking. During the conventional cooking 32.7–64.5% of vitamin C and 45.7–66.9% of total phenolics were retained in cooked tissue. Decreasing cooking water volume by half led to better retention of both phenolics (by 2.7–14.5%) and vitamin C (by 14.2–18.4%). However, shortening the cooking time by half affected the retention of phenolics and vitamin C only by 3.8–6.7% and 0–2.2%, respectively. Steam-cooking is recommended to prevent the major loss of scavenging activity, because under these conditions, the corresponding TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) values were reduced only by 5–20%. Moreover, the content of vitamin C was decreased by 2.1–22.7% while losses of total phenolics were up to 10%. The phenolics are the major source of free radical scavenging activity of red cabbage, since the contribution of vitamin C to TEAC for fresh and cooked red cabbage was from 18.2 to 28.5%.",1
"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy with varying survival rates across countries with low, middle, and high income. The assessment of nutritional status (NS) using anthropometric indicators has been explored for its potential relationship on treatment outcomes. This study analyzed a 3-year retrospective cohort of Mexican pediatric patients with ALL, exploring the association between NS at diagnosis and relapse/mortality. Retrospective observational study. Medical records from 252 pediatric patients with ALL were included; anthropometric indicators (Z-scores) of body weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and triceps and subscapular skinfolds (TSF and SSF, respectively) measurements were used to assess NS. The relapse/mortality data were collected from medical records. Kaplan-Meier (KM) functions and Cox regression models were performed to evaluate the effect of indicators on survival, relapse, and event (death or disease relapse). Patients with malnutrition showed a significantly lower survival rate according to their BMI (76% vs 63%, p = 0.049), while relapses were higher in the group with TSF < -2 SD (41% vs 12%, p = 0.007). Patients with stunting and TSF < -2 SD showed a higher risk of mortality (HR:6.214, 95%CI: 1.372 to 28.154; HR:2.91, 95%CI: 1.27 to 6.68, respectively), while in patients with higher MUAC Z-score showed a decrease in the mortality risk (HR:0.85, 95%CI:0.73 to 1.00). The nutritional status assessed by anthropometric measurements was a strong predictor of survival and relapse outcomes 3y post/diagnosis in this cohort of pediatric patients with ALL.",0
"Most naturally occurring foods that are sources of anthocyanins are often processed under severe temperature, pressure, and pH conditions that may extensively alter the naturally occurring pigments with loss of their potential antioxidant properties. It is desirable that anthocyanins present in pigmented maize not be completely destroyed when producing processed products. In the present study, the effect of different concentrations of calcium hydroxide used in the nixtamalization after fractionation process on the stability of the pigments found in blue maize was evaluated. The anthocyanin profile was analyzed using HPLC. The total anthocyanin content as well as that of acyl-type anthocyanins decreased during the cooking process and as the concentrations of calcium hydroxide used increased (P<0.001). More anthocyanin was retained in the nixtamalization after fractionation process with 0.5% calcium hydroxide than in the traditional nixtamalization process. In maize cooked and nixtamalized with up to 1.5% calcium hydroxide, only 16.1% of the acyl-type anthocyanin remained, compared to between 32 and 38% in the original uncooked maize. Conversely, the cyanidin and pelargonidin anthocyanin content increased.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor cell therapy is a successful immunotherapy for the treatment of blood cancers. However, hurdles in their manufacturing remain including efficient isolation and purification of the T-cell starting material. Herein, we describe a one-step separation based on inertial spiral microfluidics for efficient enrichment of T-cells in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient's samples. In healthy donors used to optimize the process, the lymphocyte purity was enriched from 65% (SD ± 0.2) to 91% (SD ± 0.06) and T-cell purity was enriched from 45% (SD ± 0.1) to 73% (SD ± 0.02). Leukemic samples had higher starting B-cells compared to the healthy donor samples. Efficient enrichment and recovery of lymphocytes and T-cells were achieved in ALL samples with B-cells, monocytes and leukemic blasts depleted by 80% (SD ± 0.09), 89% (SD ± 0.1) and 74% (SD ± 0.09), respectively, and a 70% (SD ± 0.1) T-cell recovery. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples had lower T-cell numbers, and the separation process was less efficient compared to the ALL. This study demonstrates the use of inertial microfluidics for T-cell enrichment and depletion of B-cell blasts in ALL, suggesting its potential to address a key bottleneck of the chimeric antigen receptor-T manufacturing workflow.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematological neoplasm characterized by the clonal expansion of abnormal lymphoid precursors in bone marrow, which leads to alterations in the processes of cell differentiation and maturation as a consequence of genetic alterations. The integration of conventional methods, such as cytogenetics and immunophenotyping, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) has led to significant improvements at diagnosis and patient stratification; this has also allowed the discovery of several novel molecular entities with specific genetic variants that may drive the processes of leukemogenesis. Nevertheless, the understanding of the process of leukemogenesis remains a challenge since this disease persists as the most frequent cancer in children; it accounts for approximately one-quarter of adult acute leukemias, and the patient management may take into consideration the high intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and the relapse risk due to the various molecular events that can occur during clonal evolution. Some germline variants have been identified as risk factors or have been found to be related to the response to treatment. Therefore, better knowledge of the genetic alterations in B-ALL will have a prognostic impact from the perspective of personalized medicine. This review aims to compare, synthesize, and highlight recent findings concerning ALL obtained through NGS that have led to a better understanding of new molecular subtypes based on immunophenotypic characteristics, mutational profiles, and expression profiles.",0
"Intensive chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may affect the immune system and potentially the immune memory causing antibodies provided by vaccination to disappear. There are disagreements regarding the guidelines for posttreatment immunization strategy. Ninety-six children (aged 1-18 years at diagnosis) who completed chemotherapy for ALL were recruited. Antibody levels in the patient's serum against measles, varicella, polio, pertussis, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B were tested after completion of chemotherapy in patients who were fully vaccinated against these agents. Children who did not have positive serology to specific agents were revaccinated with a single dose accordingly. Antibody concentrations were measured again at least 4 weeks after revaccination. Positive antibody levels varied between the different agents. The highest percentage of positive serology was against polio (87%) and the lowest against pertussis (4%) (p < .001). There were significant differences between patients with high risk (HR) and non-HR ALL regarding serology status for some vaccines. After revaccination, the levels of response to each booster dose were significantly different: 100% after booster dose for varicella and polio, and only 34% after pertussis booster. Loss of humoral protection for vaccine preventable diseases is a common finding among patients with ALL. Revaccination with one dose of vaccine after completion of chemotherapy achieved seroconversion in 34-100% of the patients depending on the type of vaccine. We recommend this revaccination schedule to all children who completed ALL therapy and were previously fully vaccinated.",0
"The occurrence of gain of function mutations in STAT5B has been associated to survival, and drug resistance in Leukemia. In silico screening of compounds having inhibitory potential towards mutated proteins, can be helpful in the development of specific inhibitors. This study was designed to screen selected JAK-STAT mutations in leukemia patients and virtual exploration of molecular interaction of potential inhibitors with their mutated products. In total 276 patients were randomly recruited for this study. Demographic and clinical data were summarized. The genetic status of JAK1V623A, JAK2 S473 and STAT5BN642H were screened through allele specific PCR. In-silico analysis was performed on wild type and mutant protein sequences retrieved from Protein databank. The ligands and protein were prepared through standard protocols, and docking was performed through Auto Dock Vina 1.2.0. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia comprises 70% of the total patients. Male to female ratio was 3:1. All the patients were homozygous for JAK1V623A, JAK2 S473 major allele. However, 6 patients (5 male, 1 female) with ALL were STAT5BN642H+. The molecular docking of the ligands to wild type and STAT5BN642H+revealed that AC- 4-130, Pimozide, Indirubin and Stafib-2 have higher but differential docking affinities for SH2-domain of both normal and mutated STAT5B. However, AC-4-130 has a higher affinity for wild type and Stafib-2 has stable molecular interaction with STAT5BN642H+. The aggressive form of pediatric leukemia, carrying STAT5BN642H+ mutation is identified in the studied population. It is predicted that AC-14-30 and stafib-2 have potential for inhibition of constitutively active STAT5B if optimized for use in combination therapy.",0
"CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has shown unprecedented results in patients with B cell relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R-ALL) and B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas where no other curative options are available. In vivo monitoring of CAR-T cell kinetics is fundamental to understand the correlation between CAR-T cells expansion and persistence with treatment response and toxicity development. The aim of this study was to define a robust, sensitive, and universal method for CAR-T cell detection using flow cytometry. We set up and compared with each other three assays for CD19 CAR-T cell detection, all based on commercially available reagents. All methods used a recombinant human CD19 protein fragment recognized by the single-chain variable fragment of the CAR construct. The two indirect staining assays (CD19his + APC-conjugated antihistidine antibody and CD19bio + APC-conjugated antibiotin antibody) showed better sensitivity and specificity compared with the direct staining with CD19-FITC, and CD19his had a better cost-effective profile. We validated CAR detection with CD19his with parallel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction data and we could demonstrate a strong positive correlation. We also showed that CD19his staining can be easily included in a multicolor flow cytometry panel to achieve additional information about the cell phenotype of CAR-T cell positive subpopulations. Finally, this method can be used for different anti-CD19 CAR-T cell products and for different sample sources. These data demonstrate that detection of CAR-T cells by CD19his flow cytometry staining is a reliable, robust, and broadly applicable tool for in vivo monitoring of CAR-T cells.",0
"Current research suggests that wine contains substances that may reduce the mortality rate from coronary heart diseases. The oxidation of low-density liporoteins (LDL) is thought to be a key step in the development of atherosclerosis. In previous research, catechin oligomers, procyanidin dimers and trimers were extracted, isolated and purified from grapes seeds and tested for their inhibition on LDL oxidation, along and with other monomeric wine phenolics.We quantify the level of phenolics, major catechins [(+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, B4], phenolics acids, caftaric acid and malvidine-3-glucoside by HPLC with UV detection for 60 French varietal commercial wines taken from the South of France in order to appreciate the daily dietary intake of these compounds for French population. Based on a still significant French red wine consumption of 180 ml/day, the current daily intake of phenolics can be estimated at 400.2 mg/day/resident and catechins (monomers, dimers B1, B2, B3, B4) at 83.2 mg/day/resident, including 40% of monomers for the French population. Red wine, and particularly Egiodola, and Cabernet-Sauvignon varieties, contributes to a very significant proportion of phenolics dietary intake and, in particular catechins. These results provide a basis for epidemiological evaluation of phenolics and catechins intake by wine consumption in the French population. Few data exist on absorption and metabolism of phenolics from wine. Further studies are necessary to determine the behaviour of this class of compounds in vivo after wine absorption.",1
"The objective of the present paper was the characterisation of olive fruit varieties through the formation and variation during maturation of their flavonols, flavones and anthocyanins. An olive variety with a constant cyanidin-3-rutinoside:cyanidin-3-glucoside ratio of 1 exhibited lower contents of luteolin-7-glucoside and quercetin-3-rutinoside than varieties in which the only anthocyanin detected was cyanidin-3-rutinoside.",1
"The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL, and ORAC values when compared to methanol and HCl/methanol extracts. High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) corn genotypes.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) is a rare and aggressive leukemia. Philadelphia chromosome-positive cytogenetic abnormality is most common in CML. It is difficult to differentiate between de novo Ph+ T-ALL/LBL and T-cell lymphoblastic crises of CML. We present a case of adult Ph+ T-ALL/LBL with a likely history of antecedent CML. Initially thought to be a case of chronic-phase CML, a diagnostic quandary led to the pursuit of a lymph node biopsy that established the diagnosis of Ph+ T-LBL or T lymphoblastic blast crisis of CML, a clinical presentation extremely rare and only the second of its kind from our review of the literature. The patient was treated with an intensive chemotherapy regimen for over a year due to persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity indicating aggressive disease.",0
"In this paper, two monovarietal extravirgin olive oils, obtained from Ghiacciolo and Nostrana di Brisighella cvv. olives, were produced by two different extraction plants, a low-scale mill equipped with a two-phase decanter and a continuous water-saving industrial plant. The olive ripening index, the fatty acid analysis by capillary gas chromatography, the spectrophotometric determinations of total phenols and o-diphenols, the phenolic profile by HPLC-DAD/MSD and the oxidative stability by OSI, together with the sensory analysis on the oil produced, were evaluated. Independently of the olive processing plant, the oils originating from two cultivars of olive fruit showed different fatty acid compositions (particularly the C18:1/C18:2 ratio), phenol compositions and oxidative stabilities. Concerning the extraction system, for both cultivars, the oxidative resistance and the content of phenols and o-diphenols were higher for the oils produced by the low-scale mill. The quantitative descriptive analysis sensory analysis was not able to discriminate the oil samples from both cultivars obtained from the two plants, even if it underlined a higher bitter attribute for the Ghiacciolo cv. oil when it was obtained from the low-scale mill. The data of the sensory analysis were correlated with simple phenol and the secoiridoid contents, both determined by HPLC-DAD-MSD.",1
"ETV6::JAK2 is a fusion known to drive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in the presence of other genomic lesions which define the JAK/STAT class of Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph-like ALL). Ph-like ALL comprises approximately 15% of ALL. Patients with mutations or gene fusions signalling through the JAK/STAT pathway have particularly poor prognosis. Emerging treatments targeting JAK2 fusions and mutations are promising, and phase 3 clinical trials are in progress. However, with widespread use of JAK2 inhibitors, it is important to anticipate and manage resistance mechanisms. The JAK2 p.G993A mutation confers resistance in vitro, even to high-dose JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib. We postulated that direct inhibition of STAT3 and STAT5, downstream from JAK2, may overcome resistance. Murine-derived IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells were transfected with ETV6::JAK2 containing a p.G993A mutation for this study. These cells were confirmed to demonstrate IL-3 independence and ruxolitinib resistance prior to use in experiments. An inhibitor-response assay was conducted using differing concentrations of SH-4-54 and pimozide (STAT3/5 inhibitors) applied to ETV6::JAK2 p.G993A cells and two control cell lines. SH-4-54 and pimozide were effective against ETV6::JAK2 p.G993A cells with median lethal doses (LD50) of 296 n<sc>M</sc> for SH-4-54 and 455 n<sc>M</sc> for pimozide. Both drugs demonstrated a lesser effect on empty vector Ba/F3 cells, with an LD50 of 371 n<sc>M</sc> for SH-4-54 and 596 n<sc>M</sc> for pimozide. Neither drug demonstrated significant effect on non-JAK/STAT-activated KG-1a myeloid cells at doses near the LD50. SH-4-54 and pimozide both overcame treatment resistance in our in vitro model of JAK/STAT-driven Ph-like ALL with a mutation conferring JAK2 inhibitor resistance. While SH-4-54 demonstrates greater potency than pimozide, pimozide may be a more promising option given its demonstrated safety profile in humans. Direct STAT3 and STAT5 inhibition may be an effective approach for overcoming inevitable JAK2 inhibitor resistance-conferring mutations in patients with the poor prognostic subtype of JAK/STAT class Ph-like ALL.",0
"This article describes a potential treatment for early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL), a relatively rare and highly aggressive hematologic malignancy. A 59-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with enlarged cervical lymph nodes, weight loss, abnormal count, and morphology of peripheral blood cells was diagnosed with ETP-ALL according to morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology. The patient initially received two cycles of the VICP regimen, including vincristine, idarubicin, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone, and had a response with positive minimal residual disease (MRD). The patient was then given venetoclax plus the CAG regimen, including aclarubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After one cycle, the patient achieved complete remission with negative MRD and was eligible for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",0
"In this work, a new CE method with diode array detection (DAD) was developed for the monitoring and quantitation of flavonoids in different beans treated and untreated with UV-B radiation. Flavonoid concentration was monitored in UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively. The proposed method shows (i) the potentialities of bean sprouts as a natural source of bioactive compounds (antioxidants); (ii) the technological role of UV-B treatment for sprout isoflavone enrichment; and (iii) the good capabilities of CE-DAD to monitor this process.",1
"Three seeds of Turkish origin, flax, poppy and safflower were analyzed for their proximate, fatty acids, tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and total phenolic composition, and oxidative stability of their oil. The major fatty acid in the flax oil was alpha-linolenic acid, comprising 58.3% of total fatty acids, whereas poppy and safflower oils were rich in linoleic acid at 74.5% and 70.5% level, respectively. The amount of total tocols was 14.6 mg/100g flax, 11.0mg/100g poppy and 12.1mg/100g safflower seed. Flax and poppy oil were rich in gamma-tocopherol as 79.4 mg/100g oil and 30.9 mg/100g oil, respectively, while alpha-tocopherol (44.1g/100g oil) was dominant in safflower oil. Only alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol were found in the oils. Oxidative stability of oils was measured at 110 degrees C at the rate of 20 L/h air flow rate, and poppy oil (5.56 h) was most stabile oil followed by safflower oil (2.87 h) and flax oil (1.57). There were no correlation between oxidative stability and unsaturation degree of fatty acids and tocol levels of the oils. All of the seeds investigated provide a healthy oil profile and may have potential as a source of specialty oils on a commercial scale.",1
"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by uncontrolled myeloid cell proliferation and is primarily caused by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation [t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)]. Typical manifestations of CML include nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort due to hepatosplenomegaly. Although priapism is a rare but recognized complication of CML, it more often occurs in adults than in children. This case report describes an 11-year-old patient who experienced persistent priapism and hyperleukocytosis and ultimately received a CML diagnosis. Priapism in pediatric CML is a serious medical emergency requiring prompt medical and surgical intervention to prevent long-term complications, including the loss of erectile function. A literature review identified 19 pediatric cases of priapism associated with leukemia, 15 of which were attributed to CML. The cases varied in clinical presentation, treatment approaches, and outcomes, with management often involving a combination of aspiration, irrigation, leukapheresis, and chemotherapy. In most cases, priapism was resolved with these interventions, but some required additional measures, including shunt surgery. This review emphasizes the importance of early recognition and intervention to prevent complications in children with CML-associated priapism.",0
"The concentrations of isoflavones, especially daidzein and genistein, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography in 4 soybean cultivars and 26 soybean products. The total isoflavone content of the soybean cultivars was in the range of 525–986 mg per kg, and for soy products it was 32.9–795 mg per kg. Amongst the soybean products, the isoflavone content decreased in the order: soy sprouts, soy seeds, soy flour, soy milk, soy meals and soy sauce. Significant differences in the concentration of genistein and daidzein were observed between the commercial soy products and also within the soybean cultivars. The antioxidant activity of soybean and soy products correlated well with total phenolic content (TPC) and total isoflavones (TI), whereas TPC showed higher correlation with TI.",1
"The effect of fruit ripening on the quality of the oil extracted and on the changes in the amount of phenolic compounds was determined in two olive varieties (Olea europaea, cvs. Arbequina and Picual) in two crop seasons, characterized by showing the same mean temperature and different rainfalls. Maturation level was evaluated using six methods: Harvest date, ripening index (RI), fruit skin colour, fruit firmness, and amount of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the oil. Oil quality, evaluated using the parameters established to determine the quality level of virgin olive oils (acidity, K232, K270, peroxide index, and panel test), was not affected by fruit ripening or by the increase in rainfall of the season. However, the changes in oil stability and phenolic compounds in the oils extracted during fruit ripening strongly differed according to the variety, the maturity level of the fruit and the crop season tested. Fruit skin colour and firmness allowed a better discrimination at the initial maturity stages than the other methods tested.",1
"Outcomes in adult and pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved over successive generations due to rigorously conducted clinical trials and incorporation of novel therapeutic agents. Despite these advances, approximately 20% of high-risk pediatric patients and 50% of adults with ALL will fail to achieve long-term remission with frontline chemotherapy protocols, mostly due to relapse. The ability to predict which patients with ALL are more likely to relapse allows for early intensification of therapy and/or incorporation of novel immunotherapies with the goal of relapse prevention. In this review, we outline the most robust clinical predictors of relapse in ALL with a focus on measurable residual disease (MRD) and genomics. We also discuss application of these prognostic tools in different clinical settings including frontline treatment, pre-/post-allogeneic stem cell transplant, and pre-/post-Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy.",0
"The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.",1
"We investigated whether double-bundle (DB) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) combined with anterolateral ligament reconstruction (ALLR) improved clinical and radiological outcomes in patients at high risk of ACL failure. The primary outcome was graft failure, and secondary outcomes included knee stability and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Fifty-two patients who underwent DB ACLR combined with ALLR were included in this retrospective cohort study. Preoperative risk factors, including femorotibial angle (FTA), lateral tibial slope (LTS), medial tibial slope (MTS), and meniscal tears, were assessed using X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The grade of post-operative pivot shift, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity score were used to assess clinical outcomes. The minimum follow up duration was 2 years. The cohort (mean age, 26.1 ± 9.4 years; 51.9% male) had a mean follow-up duration of 28.9 ± 3.4 months. Preoperatively, 57.8% had lateral meniscus (LM) tears, and 61.0% had a grade 2-3 pivot shift. Postoperatively, no graft failures or revision cases occurred during follow-up. Approximately 90.4% of the patients exhibited a negative pivot shift (p < 0.001), with Lysholm and Tegner activity scores of 92.5 ± 6.1 and 5.1 ± 2.0. The medial meniscus (MM) tear group had a significantly smaller FTA than the intact group (p = 0.043). No significant differences in PROMs were found between the LM tear and intact LM groups or between the high and low MTS or LTS groups (p = n.s.). DB ACLR combined with ALLR had satisfactory clinical outcomes in patients at high risk of ACL failure, with no graft failures observed during a mean follow-up duration of 2.4 years. The technique effectively reduced the postoperative pivot shift, regardless of preoperative risk factors.

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can be classified into different subgroups based on recurrent genetic alterations. Here, targeted RNA sequencing was used to identify the novel subgroups of ALL in 144 B-other and 40 ""classical"" ALL samples. The classical TCF3-PBX1, ETV6-RUNX1, KMT2A-rearranged, and BCR-ABL1, and novel P2RY8-CRLF2, ABL-, JAK2-, ZNF384-, MEF2D-, and NUTM1-fusions were easily identified by fusion transcript analysis. IGH-CRLF2 and IGH-EPOR were found by abnormally high levels of expression of CRLF2 or EPOR. DUX4-rearranged was identified by the unusual expression of DUX4 genes and an alternative exon of ERG, or by clustering analysis of gene expression. PAX5-driven ALL, including fusions, intragenic amplifications, and mutations were identified by single-nucleotide variant analysis and manual inspection using the IGV software. Exon junction analysis allowed detection of some intragenic ERG and IKZF1 deletions. CRLF2-high associated with initial white blood cell (WBC) counts of ≥50 × 103/μL and GATA3 risk alleles (rs3781093 and rs3824662), whereas ABL/JAK2/EPOR-fusions associated with high WBC counts, National Cancer Institute's high-risk classification, and IKZF1del. ZNF384-fusions associated with CALLA-negativity and NUTM1-fusions in infants. In conclusion, targeted RNA sequencing further classified 66.7% (96 of 144) B-other ALL cases. All BCP-ALL subgroups, except for iAMP21, hyperdiploid and hypodiploid cases, were identified. Curiously, we observed higher frequencies of females within B-rest ALLs and males in PAX5-driven cases.",0
The levels of trans -resveratrol in 36 commercial red wines produced in the southern region of Brazil have been measured using a direct injection isocratic UV-HPLC method. The concentration of trans -resveratrol ranged from 0.82 to 5.75 mg/L with a mean value of 2.57 mg/L (R.S.D.%=1.99).,1
"Background Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) accounts for 25% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) age subgroup. It is associated with poor outcomes and is considered a standard indication for allogeneic stem cell transplant (Allo-SCT). Improved outcomes have been reported with addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to chemotherapy in children and the role of Allo-SCT is now being debated in the first remission. Complete response (CR) at three months is associated with improved survival even without Allo-SCT in first CR. In this study, we have analyzed disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and factors affecting survival outcomes of Ph+ ALL in the AYA subgroup, in resource-limited settings treated with chemotherapy and TKIs. Materials and methods This is a retrospective, multicenter cohort study of Ph+ ALL AYA patients, aged 18-40 years, and registered between January 2015 and December 2020. Primary objectives are to calculate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary objectives are to identify prognostic factors affecting response rates and outcomes. List of cases was obtained from hospital information system (HIS) and data were collected from patient case notes and electronic medical records. Data analysis was done utilizing the SPSS statistical program (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Results Forty-nine patients were identified with Ph+ ALL with a median age of 23 years (range: 18-40 years) and a male-to-female ratio of 2.5:1. None of the patients had central nervous system (CNS) disease. White cell count was >30,000 per mm",0
"This study examined sperm banking (SB) practices and barriers for post-pubertal males with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prior to chemotherapy. A cross-sectional survey of 2345 Children's Oncology Group oncologists across the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand yielded 572 responses. While 78% offer SB, common barriers include timing (70%) and patient health (44%). Most institutions offering SB have a dedicated oncofertility team (57%), and 86% are medium- or large-sized, suggesting greater resource availability. These results extend prior research by identifying actionable barriers and informing targeted interventions to improve access to FP for post-pubertal males with ALL.",0
"Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that lowers serum uric acid and is used to prevent acute gout flares in patients with gout. Observational and small interventional studies have suggested beneficial cardiovascular effects of allopurinol. To determine whether allopurinol improves major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint multicentre clinical trial. Four hundred and twenty-four UK primary care practices. Aged 60 years and over with ischaemic heart disease but no gout. Participants were randomised (1 : 1) using a central web-based randomisation system to receive allopurinol up to 600 mg daily that was added to usual care or to continue usual care. The primary outcome was the composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death. Secondary outcomes were non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularisation, hospitalisation for acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularisation, all cardiovascular hospitalisations, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The hazard ratio (allopurinol vs. usual care) in a Cox proportional hazards model was assessed for superiority in a modified intention-to-treat analysis. From 7 February 2014 to 2 October 2017, 5937 participants were enrolled and randomised to the allopurinol arm ( The results may not be generalisable to younger populations, other ethnic groups or patients with more acute ischaemic heart disease. One thousand six hundred and thirty-seven participants (57.4%) in the allopurinol arm withdrew from randomised treatment, but an on-treatment analysis gave similar results to the main analysis. The ALL-HEART study showed that treatment with allopurinol 600 mg daily did not improve cardiovascular outcomes compared to usual care in patients with ischaemic heart disease. We conclude that allopurinol should not be recommended for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with ischaemic heart disease but no gout. The effects of allopurinol on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease and co-existing hyperuricaemia or clinical gout could be explored in future studies. This trial is registered as EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2013-003559-39) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN 32017426). This award was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme (NIHR award ref: 11/36/41) and is published in full in The purpose of the ALL-HEART study was to determine whether giving allopurinol to people with ischaemic heart disease (also commonly known as coronary heart disease) would reduce their risk of having a heart attack, stroke or of dying from cardiovascular disease. Allopurinol is a medication usually given to patients with gout to prevent acute gout flares. It is not currently used to treat ischaemic heart disease. We randomly allocated people aged over 60 years with ischaemic heart disease to take up to 600 mg of allopurinol daily (in addition to their usual care) or to continue with their usual care. We then monitored participants for several years and recorded any major health events such as heart attacks, strokes and deaths. We obtained most of the follow-up data from centrally held electronic hospital admissions and death records, making the study easier for participants and more cost-efficient. We asked participants in both groups to complete questionnaires to assess their quality of life during the study. We also collected data to determine whether there was any economic benefit to the NHS of using allopurinol in patients with ischaemic heart disease. There was no difference in the risk of heart attacks, strokes or death from cardiovascular disease between the participants given allopurinol and those in the group continuing their usual care. We also found no difference in the risks of other cardiovascular events, deaths from any cause or quality-of-life measurements between the allopurinol and usual care groups. The results of the ALL-HEART study suggest that we should not recommend that allopurinol be given to people with ischaemic heart disease to prevent further cardiovascular events or deaths.",0
"To explore the risk factors for delayed excretion in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients treated with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX), and construct a risk prediction model to improve the safety of clinical medication. From March 2010 to March 2023, 39 adult ALL patients who received 74 courses of HD-MTX chemotherapy in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively. The blood concentration of MTX was monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at 0, 20 and 44 h after the end of MTX infusion. According to the MTX concentration of 44 h, the patients were divided into excretion delay group (≥0.3 μmol/L) and non-excretion delay group ( < 0.3 μmol/L), and the incidences of side effects were compared between the two groups. Clinical data and the results of laboratory test were collected. The risk factors associated with delayed MTX excretion were screened, and the independent risk factors for delayed excretion were identified by logistic regression analysis. A nomogram prediction model was established by R software based on the risk factors, and the predictive value of the model was also evaluated. A total of 27 courses of delayed excretion occurred in 74 courses of chemotherapy. As compared with the non-excretion delay group, the incidences of mucosal injury and nephrotoxicity increased significantly in the excretion delay group (both The incidence of delayed MTX excretion during HD-MTX chemotherapy in adult ALL patients is relatively high. The nomogram model based on the screened independent risk factors can be used to evaluate the risk of delayed excretion, timely identify individuals with high-risk of delayed excretion and adjust rescue measures combined with detection of MTX concentration to reduce the occurrence of side effects and ensure the safety of chemotherapy. 大剂量甲氨蝶呤治疗成人急性淋巴细胞白血病患者排泄延迟的风险预测模型构建与评估. 分析成人急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）患者在大剂量甲氨蝶呤（HD-MTX）化疗期间药物排泄延迟的危险因素，并构建风险预测模型，提高临床用药安全。. 回顾性分析本院在2010年3月至2023年3月收治的39例成人ALL患者，共计完成74例次HD-MTX化疗，应用高效液相色谱法检测MTX用药结束后0、20和44 h血药浓度。依据44 h血药浓度将患者分为排泄延迟组（≥0.3 μmol/L）及非排泄延迟组（ < 0.3 μmol/L），比较两组毒副反应的发生率。收集患者的临床资料及实验室检查结果，筛选出与MTX排泄延迟相关的危险因素，采用Logistic回归分析明确MTX排泄延迟的独立危险因素，基于相关危险因素应用R软件构建列线图预测模型，并评估模型的预测价值。. 74例次化疗共发生27例次排泄延迟，排泄延迟组的黏膜损害及肾功能损害发生率较非延迟组明显增加（均 成人ALL在HD-MTX化疗期间MTX排泄延迟发生率较高，基于筛选出的独立影响因素构建的列线图预测模型可用于评估排泄延迟的发生风险，及时甄别出排泄延迟的高危人群，联合MTX血药浓度检测可以个体化调整解救措施，减少毒副作用的发生，保障化疗安全。.",0

"Simultaneous determination of daidzein and genistein in soy products by capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection (CE–ED) was reported. The effects of working electrode potential, running buffer pH, separation voltage and injection time on CE–ED were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, the analytes could be separated in a 100 mmol/l borate buffer (pH 11.0) within 20 min. A 300 μm diameter carbon disk electrode has a good response at +0.70 V (vs. SCE) for the analytes. The response was linear over three orders of magnitude for the analytes.

"We report a case of relapse and refractory acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL) apparently turned into acute myeloid leukemia, which is occasional and fatal during CAR-T treatment. There are still limited data to clarify the molecular mechanism of myeloid blast populations proliferation during CAR-T treatment. A 21-year-old man with an established history of r/r B-ALL with a complex chromosome karyotype and renal extramedullary infiltration presented to our institution. He exhibited a rapid relapse with acute monocytic leukemia 19 days after CD19 CAR-T cell infusion with extensive infiltration of skin and brain. Salvage chemotherapy was ineffective, and he subsequently succumbed to the uncontrolled invasion and infiltration of leukemia cells and hemorrhage. RNA velocity analysis predicted that HSCs differentiated into GMPs and then GMPs differentiated into myeloid lineage cells. The ANXA1-FPR1/2 axis expression was significantly increased post-treatment, which promotes tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. 6q deletion (6q-) was the common genetic abnormality across all cell populations, indicating that 6q- conferred a survival ability to HSCs during CAR-T cell therapy. This case demonstrates potential mechanisms of clone evolution molecular events that CD19 CAR-T cell infusion accelerated the existing myeloid lineage evolution via ANXA1-FPR1/2 axis expression from HSCs with 6q-. (Cyto-)genetic aberrations and/or pathways previously not included in the risk stratification of B-ALL might well be predictive for response and outcome in the era of immunotherapy.",0
"An extensive study on the effects of blanching/freezing and long-term freezer storage on various bioactive compounds of more than 20 commonly used vegetables was performed. Effects were strongly plant species-dependent. Contents of dietary fibre components either were not affected or increased slightly. Minerals in general were also stable, but some losses of soluble minerals by leaching were observed. Phenolic antioxidants and vitamins were clearly more sensitive. Significant losses (20–30%) of antioxidant activity and total phenolics were detected in many vegetables. A qualitative HPLC profiling method for phenolic antioxidants was developed which proved to be very useful when evaluating the complex behaviour of phenolics during food processing. Up to one-third of vitamin C contents were lost during blanching, and further slight losses were detected during storage. Folic acid turned out to be very sensitive to blanching, with more than half of the vitamin being lost, but was stable during freezer storage. Carotenoids and sterols were not affected by blanching or freezer storage. The usefulness of the applied screening methods for evaluation of the effects of processing on vegetables is shown.",1
Two automatic flow injection methods for the determination of total polyphenols in beers based on classical reactions (the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method and the International Official method) are proposed. Their usefulness was tested by applying them to different beers. The results obtained agree with those provided by the corresponding batch methods.,1
"Hesperidin is the predominant polyphenol consumed from citrus fruits and juices. However, hesperidin is proposed to have limited bioavailability due to the rutinoside moiety attached to the flavonoid. The aim of this study was to demonstrate in human subjects that the removal of the rhamnose group to yield the corresponding flavonoid glucoside (i.e., hesperetin-7-glucoside) will improve the bioavailability of the aglycone hesperetin. Healthy volunteers (n=16) completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Subjects randomly consumed hesperetin equivalents supplied as orange juice with natural hesperidin (""low dose""), orange juice treated with hesperidinase enzyme to yield hesperetin-7-glucoside, and orange juice fortified to obtain 3 times more hesperidin than naturally present (""high dose""). The area under the curve (AUC) for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose (7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.",1
"Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.",1
"Trans-resveratrol is a phytoalexin from grapes with interesting therapeutic properties. Thus considerable interest has been directed to its study.

"Flavonoids are components of fruits, vegetables and wines. An abundance of flavonoids in the diet is correlated with reduced heart disease mortality, suggesting that they act as protective nutrients. However, little is known about the absorption and metabolism of flavonoids after normal foods are consumed. This study measured the levels of one abundant flavonoid, (+)-catechin, and its metabolites in plasma after five male and four female volunteers consumed 120 mL of red wine (RW) one day and de-alcoholized red wine (DRW) on a separate day. Each wine sample contained 35 +/- 1 mg catechin (mean +/- SEM). Plasma levels of catechin and its metabolite 3'-O-methylcatechin (3'MC) were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the trimethylsilylated (TMS) derivatives. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were determined after enzymatic hydrolysis. Before RW or DRW consumption, plasma levels of catechin, 3'MC and all conjugates were <2 nmol/L. After 1 h, average levels of catechin, 3'MC and all conjugates increased to 91 +/- 14 nmol/L (RW) and 81 +/- 11 nmol/L (DRW). At 1 h, 21 +/- 1% of the metabolites were methylated and <2% of catechin and 3'MC were unconjugated. Catechin was present as both a sulfate conjugate and a conjugate containing both glucuronide and sulfate residues. 3'MC was present primarily as a glucuronide conjugate. At every time point, catechin was present almost exclusively as metabolites, and these levels were independent of ethanol. Therefore, if flavonoids are protective nutrients, the active forms are likely to be metabolites, which are far more abundant in plasma than the forms that exist in foods.",1
"A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for the determination of matairesinol in flax seed is described. The defatted sample was spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), refluxed for 75 min in a mixture of ethanol-bidistilled water-12 M hydrochloric acid (2:2:1, v/v/v) to extract matairesinol conjugates and to hydrolyze them simultaneously. The extract was diluted with mobile phase [250 ml acetonitrile-750 ml buffer (730 ml bidistilled water, 20 ml glacial acetic acid adjusted to pH 3 with 5 M sodium hydroxide)] and injected into the HPLC system. Matairesinol was separated from other compounds on a reversed-phase column (Lichrospher 60 RP-Select B, 250 x 4 mm, 5 micro m) and detected in a coulometric electrode array detector using a flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. The potentials of the eight electrodes were set on +150, +200, +250, +300, +350, +400, +550 and +600 mV against modified palladium electrodes. The content of matairesinol determined in seven samples varies between 7 and 28.5 micro g/g. The limit of quantitation is 5 micro g/g.",1
"To study the changes of lymphocyte subsets in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at initial diagnosis and compare them with those of healthy children and patients who have achieved complete remission (CR). Furthermore, we aim to analyze the prognostic significance of lymphocyte subsets in these patients. From May 2011 to December 2015, 405 children with ALL were enrolled in this study. Peripheral blood was collected at the time of diagnosis, and lymphocyte subsets were detected by flow cytometry. Then, the percentages of lymphocyte subsets in each group were compared. In addition, survival and prognostic factor analyses were performed to determine the prognostic value of lymphocyte subsets. Lymphocyte subsets in children with ALL were dramatically different from those in healthy children and patients achieving CR. Additionally, lymphocyte subsets were correlated with different minimal residual disease and risk parameters. Furthermore, percentages of CD3+ T cells and CD4+ T cells and the ratio of CD4/CD8 were associated with different clinical outcomes. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the percentage of CD4+ T cell as an independent predictor for clinical prognosis. Lymphocyte subsets in pediatric ALL undergo dramatic changes and were related to prognosis, especially CD4+ T cells.",0

"Given the poor outcome of refractory and relapsing T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), identifying prognostic markers is still challenging. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis, we provide a comprehensive analysis of genomic imbalances in a cohort of 317 newly diagnosed patients with T-ALL including 135 children and 182 adults with respect to clinical and biological features and outcomes. SNP array results identified at least 1 somatic genomic imbalance in virtually all patients with T-ALL (∼96%). Del(9)(p21) (∼70%) and UPD(9)p21)/CDKN2A/B (∼28%) were the most frequent genomic imbalances. Unexpectedly del(13)(q14)/RB1/DLEU1 (∼14%) was the second most frequent copy number variant followed by del(6)(q15)/CASP8AP2 (∼11%), del(1)(p33)/SIL-TAL1 (∼11%), del(12)(p13)ETV6/CDKN1B (∼9%), del(18)(p11)/PTPN2 (∼9%), del(1)(p36)/RPL22 (∼9%), and del(17)(q11)/NF1/SUZ12 (∼8%). SNP array also revealed distinct profiles of genomic imbalances according to age, immunophenotype, and oncogenetic subgroups. In particular, adult patients with T-ALL demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of del(1)(p36)/RPL22, and del(13)(q14)/RB1/DLEU1, and lower incidence of del(9)(p21) and UPD(9p21)/CDKN2A/B. We determined a threshold of 15 genomic imbalances to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups of relapse. Survival analysis also revealed the poor outcome, despite the low number of affected cases, conferred by the presence of chromothripsis (n = 6, ∼2%), del(16)(p13)/CREBBP (n = 15, ∼5%) as well as the newly-identified recurrent gain at 6q27 involving MLLT4 (n = 10, ∼3%). Genomic complexity, del(16)(p13)/CREBBP and gain at 6q27 involving MLLT4, maintained their significance in multivariate analysis for survival outcome. Our study thus demonstrated that whole genome analysis of imbalances provides new insights to refine risk stratification in T-ALL. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT00222027 and #NCT00327678, and as #FRALLE 2000T trial.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer worldwide. Along with other lymphocytes, NK cells have important functions in the recognition and elimination of malignant cells, and thus are of interest for the development of novel therapeutic treatments of various cancers, including leukemia. The signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) family includes surface molecules that are expressed in hematopoietic cells, where they regulate distinct cell responses. Altered expression and/or function of these receptors may be involved in the etiology of several diseases. Here we report the altered overall expression of SLAM family receptors (SFR) in leukemia cells from pediatric patients. Additionally, we found that the expression of a single type of SLAM receptor in leukemia target cells was sufficient to upregulate the release of cytotoxic granules from primary NK cells. Moreover, coating the leukemia cell surface with specific engagers containing recombinant SFR was sufficient to enhance NK-cell degranulation and unleash the cytotoxic competence of primary NK cells from ALL patients. Finally, the NK effector responses promoted by SLAM receptor engagement were dependent on the ability to recruit PLC-γ. Overall, these findings suggest that SFR are a promising resource for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",0
"The incorporation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) led to significant improvement. However, in the pediatric setting, the outcomes of Ph+ ALL are still inferior compared to those of other ALL subtypes even in the TKI era due to higher relapse rate. Herein, we report a very peculiar case of late extramedullary Ph+ ALL relapse in a child, characterized by lymphomatous presentation in the tonsils and lymphoid lineage switch. The diagnostic dilemma between the occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm and the recurrence of the primary disease is further discussed, highlighting the importance of molecular backtracking analysis. This case report emphasizes the high plasticity and polyclonal nature of ALL and expands the heterogeneity of possible clinical presentation of Ph+ ALL at relapse.",0
"With improving childhood cancer cure rates, there is a growing focus on the long-term health and well-being of survivors. School reintegration is crucial for their rehabilitation and psychosocial adaptation, yet little is known about school violence and bullying faced by cancer survivors upon their return. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and forms of school bullying against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors, identifying risk and protective factors. ALL survivors aged 6-18 years were assessed through interviews and questionnaires. A paired comparison group of healthy students was recruited from their classrooms. The study included 70 students from grades 6-12 (mean age 14.9 ± 1.82 years), comprising 35 ALL survivors and a paired comparison group. ALL survivors endured more physical (M = 1.64, SD = 1.00) and relational bullying (M = 1.50, SD = 1.04) than their healthy classmates (M = 0.90, SD = 0.58; M = 0.90, SD = 0.51 respectively), while facing similar verbal bullying levels (M = 1.71, SD = 0.99 vs. M = 1.38, SD = 0.69). However, survivors reported less cyberbullying (M = 0.45, SD = 0.36) and severe bullying (M = 0.41, SD = 0.05) than their healthy classmates (M = 1.49, SD = 0.48; M = 0.66, SD = 0.53 respectively). Survivors who returned to a different school cohort post-remission faced higher bullying risks than those who rejoined their original cohort (-0.79 < β < -0.92; p < 0.001). Physical disfigurements following cancer treatment were a risk factor for victimization only among those who returned to their original cohort. The findings highlight the unique challenges faced by childhood leukemia survivors in school reintegration after cancer therapy, emphasizing the significant effect of the school cohort environment on their bullying experiences.",0
"To explore the clinical application value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in pathogen detection of bloodstream infection secondary to hematologic diseases in children. 42 children with bloodstream infections secondary to hematologic diseases admitted to the Children's Hematology and Tumor Center of the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University from November 2021 to May 2023 were included in the study, and their clinical data, results of peripheral blood mNGS and traditional blood culture, pathogen distribution characteristics, and diagnostic efficacy of mNGS were retrospectively analyzed. Among the 42 children included, there were 2 cases (4.8%) of aplastic anemia (AA), 27 cases (64.3%) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 7 cases (16.7%) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 1 case (2.4%) of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 2 cases (4.8%) of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), 2 cases (4.8%) of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 1 case (2.4%) of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). In mNGS testing, pathogens were detected in 31 peripheral blood samples, with a positive rate of 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the pathogen positive rate of 16.7% (7/42) detected by traditional blood culture, and the difference was statistically significant ( Peripheral blood mNGS has advantages in the detection of pathogens of bloodstream infection secondary to hematologic diseases, with a higher detection rate of pathogen positivity than traditional blood cultures.

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common childhood cancer characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature white blood cells. While advancements in treatment have significantly improved outcomes in developed countries, significant challenges remain in resource-limited settings, such as Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess the clinical profiles and treatment outcomes of ALL patients at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (UoGCSH) and Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) in Ethiopia. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted among 179 ALL patients receiving treatment at the outpatient department and pediatric oncology centers of the UoGCSH and TASH between December 25, 2022, and August 30, 2024. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a structured questionnaire. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize patient characteristics, while overall survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Additionally, both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed, with statistical significance set at a P-value of < 0.05. Among the 179 patients, 81 (45.3%) died during the course of treatment. Of these, 33 (18%) died before initiating induction therapy, while 48 (27.4%) died primarily due to treatment abandonment during various phases of therapy. The event-free survival rate was 75 (41.9%). Mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with certain variables identified through Cox regression analysis, including age, sepsis, and relapse, which nearly doubled the risk of death. Elevated LDH levels, malaria infection, and T-cell ALL were associated with approximately six-fold, three-fold, and seven-fold increases in the risk of death, respectively. Only 22 out of 179 patients (12.29%) achieved remission. Among these patients, hematotoxicities observed during the maintenance phase included anemia in 19/22 (86.4%), grade 3-4 neutropenia in 12/22 (52.2%), and thrombocytopenia in 17/22 (77.3%). A high mortality rate was observed among children with ALL, with significant risk factors including relapse, age over 10 years, elevated LDH levels, sepsis, low platelet counts, T-cell ALL, malaria infection, and induction failure. To improve survival rates, it is essential to address these factors by optimizing treatment regimens and minimizing delays in diagnosis and care delivery.",0
"Coagulopathy and associated bleeding and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute leukemia. The underlying mechanisms of these complications have not been fully elucidated. To evaluate the associations between biomarker levels and bleeding and VTE in acute leukemia patients. We examined plasma levels of activators, inhibitors and biomarkers of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways in patients ≥18 years with newly diagnosed acute leukemia compared to healthy controls. Multivariable regression models were used to examine the association of biomarkers with bleeding and VTE in acute leukemia patients. The study included 358 patients with acute leukemia (29 acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL], 253 non-APL acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and 76 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), and 30 healthy controls. Patients with acute leukemia had higher levels of extracellular vesicle (EV) tissue factor (TF) activity, phosphatidylserine-positive EVs, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, cell-free DNA and lower levels of citrullinated histone H3-DNA complexes compared to healthy controls. APL patients had the highest levels of EVTF activity and the lowest levels of tissue plasminogen activator among the acute leukemia patients. There were 41 bleeding and 37 VTE events in acute leukemia patients. High EVTF activity was associated with increased risk of bleeding (sHR 2.30, 95%CI 0.99-5.31) whereas high PAI-1 was associated with increased risk of VTE (sHR 3.79, 95%CI 1.40-10.28) in these patients. Our study shows alterations in several biomarkers in acute leukemia and identifies biomarkers associated with risk of bleeding and VTE.",0
"The treatment landscape for pediatric cancers over the last 11 years has undergone a dramatic change, especially with relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), due to the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy. Because of the success of CAR-T cell therapy in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell ALL, this promising therapy is undergoing trials in multiple other pediatric malignancies. This article will focus on the introduction of CAR-T cell therapy in pediatric B-cell ALL and discuss past and current trials. We will also discuss trials for CAR-T cell therapy in other pediatric malignancies. This information was gathered through a comprehensive literature review along with using first hand institutional experience. Due to the potential severe toxicities related to CAR-T cell therapy, safe practices and monitoring are key. These authors demonstrate that nurses have a profound responsibility in preparing and caring for patients and families, monitoring and managing side effects in these patients, ensuring that study guidelines are followed, and providing continuity for patients, families, and referring providers. Education of nurses is crucial for improved patient outcomes.",0
"Overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) resulting from its genomic rearrangement is the most frequent genetic alteration found in Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), a high-risk leukemia. Detection of CRLF2 expression by multiparameter flow cytometry has been proposed as a screening tool for the identification of Ph-like B-ALL. However, the prognostic relevance of flow cytometric expression of CRLF2 in pediatric B-ALL is not very clear. Additionally, its association with common copy number alterations (CNA) has not been studied in detail. Hence, in this study, we prospectively evaluated the flow cytometric expression of CRLF2 in 256 pediatric B-ALL patients and determined its association with molecular features such as common CNAs detected using Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and mutations in",0
"The anthocyanin pigmentaion of the juices obtained from six Tunisian pomegranate cultivars harvested at commercial maturity was studied by HPLC. The anthocyanin content in the juice ranged between 6 μg/ml and 120 μg/ml. Six anthocyanins, namely the 3-O-glucosides and the 3,5-diglucosides of pelargonidin, cyanidin and delphinidin, were detected in all samples. Differences in the relative amounts of each anthocyanin were found for the different cultivars. The total amount of anthocyanin pigmentation of pomegranate juice was largely affected by the variety, the maturation stage and the geographical location of the fruit, but the anthocyanin profile remained quite stable under the different conditions. The anthocyanin profile constituted by the six pigments seems to be identical to those reported previously for Californian, Spanish and Italian pomegranates, and only differences in the relative amounts of the individual anthocyanins could be related to the variety and other climatic and cultural variables. These data suggest that the HPLC anthocyanin profile of pomegranate juice could be used as an adjunct in its analytical characterization, and in the differentiation with other anthocyanincontaining juices in food authenticity studies.",1
"Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major dimers released were: trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), (Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid (5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.",1
We report the case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a 29-year-old male with no past medical history who presented with symptoms and signs of heart failure due to possible infiltrative cardiomyopathy as suggested by echocardiography. Workup including different imaging modalities confirmed the diagnosis of ALL. The patient completed his treatment course with a resolution of heart failure symptoms and normalization of cardiac function which was confirmed by different imaging modalities.,0
"The protective effect on health of wine consumed in moderation has been widely studied in recent years. This has been attributed to the content in polyphenols and to the antioxidant activity of these compounds. The products derived from wine, such as vinegar and brandy, also contain polyphenols and could possess a certain antioxidant activity, similarly contributing to a protective effect for health. This paper describes the study of the antioxidant power of diverse Sherry brandies and vinegars, by means of an electrochemical method previously devised. The total polyphenolic content is studied using the method of Folin–Ciocalteu, and some polyphenols are identified and quantified by means of HPLC. A close correlation between the antioxidant power and the total polyphenolic content of the samples has been found. Considering the polyphenols individually, the compounds that are better correlated with the antioxidant power of the samples are not necessarily those that are present in higher concentrations. For brandies, the contact with wood has an important contribution to their antioxidant power.",1
"A 47-year-old male had recurrent, profuse watery diarrhea and abdominal discomfort for more than 7 months, with a fever for 5 days. Two years earlier, he received treatment with a modified BFM-90 protocol for acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia and is currently in the final stages of maintenance therapy with oral methotrexate and mercaptopurine. The leukemia was assessed as still in remission two months ago. PET/CT showed massive peritoneal fluid accumulation and a high uptake area in the diffused peritoneum (SUVmax 12.57), suggesting tumor invasion or microbial infections. However, broad-spectrum antibacterial therapies were ineffective. Metagenomic sequencing of plasma and peritoneal fluid showed no suggestion of the existence of a tumor but instead showed a high sequence number of DNA and RNA of the Microsporidia. His albendazole treatment failed and subsequent treatment with nitazoxanide successfully resolved the infection. This case shows that we should consider the possibility of atypical pathogen infection in patients with hematologic malignancy who repeatedly develop unexplained diarrhea with wasting. mNGS can help rule out malignant neoplasms and diagnose infections. Our results suggest that nitazoxanide effectively treats",0
"Juices from the mandarin Clemenules (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.), the tangor Ortanique (Citrus reticulata Blanco × Citrus sinensis Osb.) and the sweet orange Valencia Late (Citrus sinensis) have been industrially squeezed, pasteurized, concentrated and stored under refrigeration (4 °C) and at room temperature (20 °C). After each process, the flavanone-7-O-glycosides (FGs) and fully methoxylated flavones (FMFs) contents as well as total, cumulative fast-kinetics and cumulative slow-kinetics antiradical activities were determined and compared with those from the corresponding fresh hand-squeezed juices. Neither industrial-squeezing, nor pasteurization or concentration significantly affected FGs and FMFs contents and antiradical activities of assayed juices. Storage caused a slight decrease of the FMFs contents but a significant reduction of both soluble hesperidin contents and cumulative fast-kinetics antiradical activities in all assayed juices. These decreases were dependent on storage temperature. Characteristic values of the varietal characterization parameters, which are derived from the FMFs contents and antiradical activities of fresh hand-squeezed juices, held valid for industrially squeezed, pasteurized and concentrated juices. After storage, however, only the FMFs-derived varietal characterization parameters and cumulative slow-kinetics antiradical activity remained valid for the resulting juices.",1
"The distribution of total phenolics and main betacyanins in red beetroot (Beta vulgaris) root was determined. Also, the subsequent effects of cold storage on the content of total phenolics, main betacyanins (betanin and isobetanin), and the main known ferulic acid ester (beta-D-fructofuranosyl-alpha-D-(6-O-(E)-feruloylglucopyranoside) were determined in the peel, which is the root part containing the largest amount of total phenolics. The content of total phenolics in the red beetroot water extracts was determined according to a modification of the Folin-Ciocalteu method and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The compounds of interest were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS and NMR techniques, and the contents of compounds were determined by HLPC analyses. The total phenolic contents in various root parts were found to decrease in the order peel, crown, flesh. Significant differences in the contents of total phenolics and individual compounds were found when the effect of cold storage (5 degrees C, 0-196 days) on the constituents of the peel from intact roots was examined. In addition to the betacyanins of red beetroot peel found in our earlier study, tentative identifications of betanidin and feruloylamaranthin were made.",1
"Many high-dose groups demonstrate increased leukaemia risks, with risk greatest following childhood exposure; risks at low/moderate doses are less clear. We conducted a pooled analysis of the major radiation-associated leukaemias (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with/without the inclusion of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)) in ten childhood-exposed groups, including Japanese atomic bomb survivors, four therapeutically irradiated and five diagnostically exposed cohorts, a mixture of incidence and mortality data. Relative/absolute risk Poisson regression models were fitted. Of 365 cases/deaths of leukaemias excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, there were 272 AML/CML/ALL among 310,905 persons (7,641,362 person-years), with mean active bone marrow (ABM) dose of 0.11 Gy (range 0-5.95). We estimated significant (P < 0.005) linear excess relative risks/Gy (ERR/Gy) for: AML (n = 140) = 1.48 (95% CI 0.59-2.85), CML (n = 61) = 1.77 (95% CI 0.38-4.50), and ALL (n = 71) = 6.65 (95% CI 2.79-14.83). There is upward curvature in the dose response for ALL and AML over the full dose range, although at lower doses (<0.5 Gy) curvature for ALL is downwards. We found increased ERR/Gy for all major types of radiation-associated leukaemia after childhood exposure to ABM doses that were predominantly (for 99%) <1 Gy, and consistent with our prior analysis focusing on <100 mGy.",0
"The anthocyanin and anthocyanidin pigment profiles of 46 authentic red raspberry juice samples were determined by HPLC. Total anthocyanin pigment content and percent polymeric color were also determined. This generated a database incorporating influences of cultivar, geographic origin, maturity, processing, and mold contamination. Cultivars exhibited characteristic patterns distinguished by quantitative rather than qualitative differences. Total pigment ranged from 4 to 1,102 mg/L. Commercial red raspberry juice concentrates (14) were also analyzed. Two were shown to be adulterated because of the presence of delphinidin glycosides. Three samples contained high amounts of polymerized pigments, indicating a history of processing or storage abuse.",1
"Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation are the only available fertility techniques for prepubertal girls with cancer. Though autotransplantation carries a risk of reintroducing malignant cells, it can be avoided by identifying minimal infiltrative disease (MID) within ovarian tissue. A broad search for peer-reviewed articles in the PubMed database was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines up to March 2023. Search terms included 'minimal residual disease', 'cryopreservation', 'ovarian', 'cancer' and synonyms. Out of 542 identified records, 17 were included. Ovarian tissues of at least 115 girls were evaluated and categorized as: hematological malignancies ( While the majority of malignancies were found to have a low risk of containing malignant cells in ovarian tissue, further studies are needed to ensure safe implementation of future fertility restoration in clinical practice.",0
"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a cause of increased morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. VTE is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Risk assessment models have been developed to identify patients at risk of VTE for thromboprophylaxis. Risk scores of patients in our environment have not been adequately investigated. The study evaluates the association of thrombotic risk assessment scores (using the modified Khorana risk assessment tool) and soluble P-selectin levels with thrombotic events in patients with lymphoid cancer. This is a comparative cross-sectional study conducted at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH, Nnewi, Anambra State). Forty-five patients with lymphoid malignancy and 45 apparently healthy subjects participated in the study. The modified Khorana risk assessment score was used to assess cancer-associated thrombotic risk. Blood sample was collected for soluble P-selectin estimation. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 23. The age of subjects with lymphoid neoplasm and controls were 49.1±15.8 years, and 49.6±11.1 years respectively (p = 0.548). Subjects with lymphoid neoplasm consist of 26 (57.8%) males and 19 (42.2%) females while the controls consist of 25 (55.6%) males and 20 (44.4%) females. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most frequent of lymphoid neoplasm (18, 40.0%), followed by multiple myeloma (10, 22%), CLL (9, 20%), ALL (6, 13.0%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (2, 4.0%). Thirty-five (77.8%) subjects with lymphoid neoplasm had intermediate risk scores and 10 (22.2%) had high-risk scores. Nineteen (42.2%) of the controls had intermediate risk and 26 (57.8%) low risk. The differences in proportion were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The median (IQR) levels of soluble P-selectin were significantly higher in patients with lymphoid neoplasm (12.2 vs. 7.0ng/mL, p <0.001). Three (6.6%) patients with lymphoid malignancies had deep vein thrombosis confirmed by a Doppler ultrasound scan. Lymphoid malignancy is associated with relatively higher thrombotic risk scores, sP-selectin levels, and venous thromboembolic events. La thromboembolie veineuse (TEV) est une cause de morbidité et de mortalité accrues chez les patients atteints de cancer. La TEV est la deuxième cause de décès chez les patients atteints de cancer. Des modèles d’évaluation des risques ont été mis au point pour identifier les patients présentant un risque de TEV en vue d’une thromboprophylaxie. Les scores de risque des patients dans notre environnement n’ont pas été étudiés de manière adéquate. L’étude évalue l’association des scores d’évaluation du risque thrombotique (en utilisant l’outil modifié d’évaluation du risque de Khorana) et des niveaux de P-sélectine soluble avec les événements thrombotiques chez les patients atteints d’un cancer lymphoïde. Il s’agit d’une étude transversale comparative menée au Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital (NAUTH, Nnewi, État d’Anambra). Quarante-cinq patients atteints d’un cancer lymphoïde et 45 sujets apparemment sains ont participé à l’étude. Le score modifié d’évaluation du risque de Khorana a été utilisé pour évaluer le risque thrombotique associé au cancer. Un échantillon de sang a été prélevé pour l’estimation de la P-sélectine soluble. Les données ont été analysées avec SPSS version 23. L’âge des sujets atteints de néoplasme lymphoïde et des témoins était respectivement de 49,1±15,8 ans et 49,6±11,1 ans (p = 0,548). Les sujets atteints de néoplasme lymphoïde sont 26 (57,8 %) hommes et 19 (42,2 %) femmes, tandis que les témoins sont 25 (55,6 %) hommes et 20 (44,4 %) femmes. Le lymphome non hodgkinien était le néoplasme lymphoïde le plus fréquent (18, 40 %), suivi du myélome multiple (10, 22 %), de la LLC (9, 20 %), de la LAL (6, 13 %) et du lymphome hodgkinien (2, 4 %). Trente-cinq (77,8 %) sujets atteints de néoplasmes lymphoïdes présentaient un score de risque intermédiaire et 10 (22,2 %) un score de risque élevé. Dix-neuf (42,2 %) des témoins présentaient un risque intermédiaire et 26 (57,8 %) un risque faible. Les différences de proportion étaient statistiquement significatives (p < 0,001). Les niveaux médians (IQR) de P-sélectine soluble étaient significativement plus élevés chez les patients atteints de néoplasme lymphoïde (12,2 vs. 7,0 ng/mL, p <0,001).

"Assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) is the most powerful predictor of outcome in B-type acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). MRD, defined as the presence of leukemic cells in the blood or bone marrow, is used for the evaluation of therapy efficacy. We report on a microfluidic-based MRD (MF-MRD) assay that allows for frequent evaluation of blood for the presence of circulating leukemia cells (CLCs). The microfluidic chip affinity selects B-lineage cells, including CLCs using anti-CD19 antibodies poised on the wall of the microfluidic chip. Affinity-selected cells are released from the capture surface and can be subjected to immunophenotyping to enumerate the CLCs, perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and/or molecular analysis of the CLCs' mRNA/gDNA. During longitudinal testing of 20 patients throughout induction and consolidation therapy, the MF-MRD performed 116 tests, while only 41 were completed with multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC-MRD) using a bone marrow aspirate, as standard-of-care. Overall, 57% MF-MRD tests were MRD(+) as defined by CLC numbers exceeding a threshold of 5 × 10",0
"A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, two isomeric forms of 1,2-disinapoylgentiobiose, 1-sinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In general, internal leaves exhibited more constant chemical profiles.",1
"Flavonoids, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives (sinapic and ferulic acid derivatives+caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives) and vitamin C were quantified by HPLC-MS in five commercial and three experimental cultivars from freshly harvested broccoli inflorescences ( Brassica oleracea L. var. italica). In order to identify differences due to genetic and agronomic factors, the broccoli cultivars were grown under different climatic and agronomic conditions, i.e. early (winter) and late (spring) seasons with poor (15 kg/ha) and rich (150 kg/ha) sulphur fertilisation. The predominant sinapic and ferulic acid derivatives in all broccoli cultivars were 1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In addition, the compounds 1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1-sinapoyl-2,2'-diferuloylgentiobiose and 1,2,2'-triferuloylgentiobiose were identified in broccoli inflorescences for the first time. Extreme agronomic and environmental conditions (late season and rich sulphur fertilisation which could induce different stress situations on the plant) enhanced the phenolic content. Thus, total flavonoids showed the highest content, followed by total sinapic and feruloyl acid derivatives and total caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. In general, cultivars grown under rich fertilisation and late season conditions showed higher vitamin C content than those grown under the poor and early ones. Finally, results showed that commercial cultivars rendered higher amounts of phenolic compounds and vitamin C than the experimental ones.",1
"To explore the metabolism of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1,5-DCQA) in rats, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in parallel to diode-array detection was used for the rapid detection/characterization of the metabolites formed in bile, urine, and plasma of rats following oral administration of 1,5-DCQA (160 mg/kg). The methylation and glucuronidation of 1,5-DCQA occurring in vitro using rat liver and small intestinal microsomes and cytosols were studied in comparison with those occurring in vivo, and the enzymes involved were also determined. In addition, the anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) activity of three important metabolites was preliminarily evaluated in MT-4 cells infected with HIV-1. A total of 22 metabolites in vivo and in vitro were identified, including four isomeric O-mono-methylated metabolites (M8–M11), nine isomeric O-di-methylated metabolites (M3, M6, M22, and M12–M17), four isomeric O-mono-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M2 and M19–M21), four isomeric O-di-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M1, M4, M5, and M7), and one glucuronidated metabolite (M18). The O-methylation positions of three important metabolites (M8, M9, and M12) were determined (3″-, 3′-, and 3′,3″-) by comparing with synthesized standards. The efficacy experiments showed that M8, M9, and M12 could inhibit HIV replication with IC50 values of about 25, 25, and 46 μM, respectively. These results suggest that O-methylation and glucuronidation are two important metabolic pathways of 1,5-DCQA, that both rat liver and small intestine can catalyze such reactions by catechol-O-methyltransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and that the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of M8, M9, and M12 is comparable to or slightly weaker than that of 1,5-DCQA.",1
"Acute gastro-intestinal graft- We did a retrospective single-center analysis of patients receiving Flu-TBI-based NMA HCT for a high-grade myeloid malignancy, mostly AML, and MDS, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We analyzed the impact of pre-engraftment antibiotic exposure, prophylactic ciprofloxacin, and or treatment with broad-spectrum cephalosporin/carbapenem, on HCT outcomes, with a focus on the incidence of acute GI-GVHD by day 180 and NRM at 1 year. A total of 150 patients were evaluable with a median age of 62 years. Antibiotics were used in 90 patients; 60 prophylactic use only and 30 therapeutic use with or without previous prophylaxis. Antibiotic use resulted in a significant higher incidence of GI-GVHD Stage 1-4; 29% (26/90) Use of antibiotics was related to the occurrence of GI-GVHD, NRM, and GRFS in patients receiving truly NMA HCT. Therefore, in the absence of mucositis and low incidence of bacteremia, antibiotics can and should be used restrictively in this setting.",0
Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are key molecules used by natural killer (NK) cells to interact with target cells. These receptors exhibit extensive genotypic polymorphism which has been associated with varying outcomes in immune responses against diseases. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between A total of 259 Saudi subjects including 145 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 114 healthy controls living in Riyadh were genotyped for 16 A significant high frequency of the two inhibitory This study presents strong evidence supporting the connection between certain,0
"Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ BCP-ALL) is a high-risk subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by the presence of the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) combined with chemotherapy are established as the first-line treatment. Additionally, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is administered to adult BCP-ALL patients with ≥20% CD20+ blasts. In this study, we observed a marked prevalence of CD20 expression in patients diagnosed with Ph+ BCP-ALL, indicating a potential widespread clinical application of rituximab in combination with TKI. Consequently, we examined the influence of TKI on the antitumor effectiveness of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies by evaluating levels of CD20 on the cell surface and conducting in vitro functional assays. All tested TKI were found to uniformly downregulate CD20 on leukemic cells, diminishing the efficacy of rituximab-mediated complement- dependent cytotoxicity. Interestingly, these TKI displayed varied effects on natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody- dependent cytotoxicity and macrophage phagocytic function. While asciminib demonstrated no inhibition of effector cell functions, dasatinib notably suppressed the anti-CD20-monoclonal antibody-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity and macrophage phagocytosis of BCP-ALL cells. Dasatinib and ponatinib also decreased NK cell degranulation in vitro. Importantly, oral administration of dasatinib, but not asciminib, compromised NK cell activity in patients' blood, as determined by an ex vivo degranulation assay. Our results indicate that asciminib might be preferred over other TKI for combination therapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.",0

"The current chemotherapy treatments have led to an improvement in survival rates for pediatric Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Survival in children with high-grade, mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) has been prolonged by six rituximab doses combined with chemotherapy, whereas the efficacy of four doses has not been reported. This study aimed to explore optimal therapeutic strategies-the number of doses of rituximab based on different risk groups-and also aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of Chinese pediatric BL. This study consecutively enrolled children with BL in Beijing Children's Hospital who received French-American-British mature B-cell lymphoma 96 (FAB/LMB96). The patients were divided into three groups: R0 group (chemotherapy alone), R6 group (chemotherapy combined with six rituximab doses), and R4 group (chemotherapy combined with four rituximab doses). The clinical characteristics and outcomes were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses and prognostic nomogram were used to assess prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed that predicted overall survival based on the Cox proportional hazards model, and the concordance index (C-index) and a calibration curve were used to determine its predictive and discriminatory capacity. We enrolled 385 boys and 71 girls, with a median age of 6 years (1-14 years). Of these, 296 patients (65%) had initial abdominal symptoms, 182 (40%) had bulky disease, 46 (10%) had B symptoms, 77 (16.9%) had BL-ALL (blasts ≥ 25% in bone marrow (BM)), 96 (21%) had central nervous system (CNS) disease, 406 (89%) were in stages III-IV, 378 (83%) were in group C, 170 (37.2%) had lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels ≥ 1000 U/L at initial diagnosis, and 137 (30%) had tumor lysis syndrome. The R0, R6, and R4 groups included 79, 144, and 227 patients, respectively. Six patients were excluded due to treatment withdrawal for various reasons. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) percentages were 92% ± 1.3% and 91.3% ± 1.3%, respectively, in all cohorts, whereas the 3-year EFS percentage was 83.5% ± 4.2%, 93% ± 2.1%, and 92.9% ± 1.8% in the R0, R6, and R4 groups, respectively (P = 0.025). The nomogram included four important variables based on a multivariate analysis of the primary cohort: course of disease ≤ 20 days, presence of bulky disease at the beginning of diagnosis, central nervous system(CNS) invasion, and dosage of rituximab. The calibration curve showed that the nomogram was able to predict 3-year OS accurately. The C-index of the nomogram for OS prediction was 0.79 for both cohorts. In our hospital, pediatric BL was more commonly observed in school-age boys with an abdominal mass and mostly in advanced stages at initial diagnosis. The FAB/LMB96 regimen combined with rituximab significantly increased survival outcomes. We observed no significant differences between four and six doses of rituximab in terms of treatment outcomes. The proposed nomogram provides an individualized risk estimate of OS in patients with BL and may assist treatment decision-making or rituximab dose design.",0
"The application of an improved method of extraction and purification has allowed the characterization of anthocyanins and free anthocyanidins in beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L. using LC-MS determination. HPLC analysis of the final extract showed the existence of seven compounds when 520 nm was the selected wavelength. Major peaks were identified, according to their retention times and UV–Vis spectra, as cyanidin and pelargonidin monoglucosides when they were compared to those of the in-house library. Taking into account mass spectrometric data, together with elution time and spectral features, it was possible to identify peaks corresponding to cyanidin and pelargonidin diglucosides. As far as we know, these anthocyanins have not been detected in P. vulgaris L. before. The last three peaks in the chromatograms were thought to be acylated anthocyanins, due to their smaller polarity. However, MS spectra showed signals at m/z 287, 301 and 271, which would be in accordance with molecular ions corresponding to anthocyanidins: cyanidin, peonidin and pelargonidin, respectively. Moreover, these compounds had the same retention times and UV–Vis spectral features as those of aglycones arising from acid hydrolysis of the final extract. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the presence, in natural form, of free aglycones in vegetable samples. Until now, the bibliographical data have indicated that, in nature, this type of compound is only found in heteroside forms.",1
"This research aimed to elucidate the association of Homeo Box 11 (HOX11) gene overexpression with refractory acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). In this investigation, 209 patients with B-ALL, who were treated in Guangdong Province between 2019 and 2024, were included. At the initial diagnosis, the RNA was obtained from bone marrow for genetic testing via Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RQ-PCR). Furthermore, the clinical data were acquired and the association of HOX11 with these clinical features and gene alterations was analysed. Finally, the relationship between gene alterations and progression-free survival (PFS) was analysed. Of the 209 B-ALL patients, 42 (20.1%) had recurrent disease. Twenty-six (12.4%) had HOX11 overexpression, of which 10 had recurrent disease. Furthermore, the HOX11 overexpression patients indicated TP53 concomitant of 23.07%, whereas the HOX11 low-expression patients showed TP53 concomitant of 8.7% (p < 0.05). Logistic regression indicated lower WBC counts and higher recurrence rates in the HOX11 overexpression group (p < 0.05). PFS analysis indicated that the HOX11 overexpression group and KMT2A::AFF1 group were associated with higher disease recurrence (p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis showed that HOX11 was an independent risk factor affecting PFS (p = 0.041). These findings are the first to demonstrate an association between HOX11 overexpression and recurrent B-ALL.",0
"This systematic review aims to explore the existing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of brexu-cel across different international jurisdictions. A systematic search of articles on Embase, Medline, Econlit, Web of Science, Scopus, gray literature, and a manual search of HTA reports was done until 24 June 2024. Original English articles and reports from different countries assessing the cost-effectiveness of brexu-cel in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL) and mantle cell lymphoma (R/R MCL) were included. This review was registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) registry. Of the 149 records, 22 articles underwent full-text review after the title and abstract screening, five met the inclusion criteria along with seven HTA reports from Australia, Canada, Scotland, and England. The CEA studies were from the US, England, Canada, and Italy, with varying perspectives, mainly adopting a partitioned survival model and lifetime horizons. The model input data from the ZUMA-2 and ZUMA-3 trials were used for brexu-cel, with comparisons from their respective trials or literature. Brexu-cel was found cost-effective in all the CEA studies and an HTA report from Scotland, but the other HTA agencies reported uncertainties around the cost-effectiveness of brexu-cel for R/R ALL and R/R MCL.

"The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts from human neutrophils in the presence of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of eggplants.",1
"The effect of roasting degree on the formation of volatile compounds in sesame seeds was investigated. Light- and deep-roasted sesame seed oils were steam distilled under reduced pressure, and volatiles from the distillate were separated by an adsorptive column method. The recoveries of total volatiles were 9726 and 2014 ppb from deep- and light-roasted oils, respectively. The relative amount of monoalkylpyrazines decreased in contrast to the increases of di- and trialkylpyrazines with increase in the degree of roasting. 1H-Pyrrole-2-carboxyaldehyde, the most abundant pyrrole, was the only volatile that decreased in deep-roasted oil. 4,5-Dimethylisothiazole, 4,5-dimethylthiazole, 2-propyl-4-methylthiazole, and 2-butyl-5-methylthiazole increased their relative amounts in deep-roasted oil. Hexanal, (E)-2-heptenal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal occurred in almost the same levels. Guaiacol and 2-furanmethanethiol increased from 32 to 321 ppb and from 6 to 40 ppb, respectively, in deep-roasted oil.",1
"B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is enriched for a preB cell phenotype, hinting at a specific vulnerability of this cell stage. Two signaling pathways via the preB cell receptor (preBCR) and the interleukin 7 receptor α (IL-7Rα) chain govern the balance between differentiation and proliferation at this stage and both receptor pathways are routinely altered in human BCP-ALL. Here, we review the immunobiology of both the preBCR as well as the IL-7Rα and analyze the human BCP-ALL spectrum in the light of these signaling complexes. Finally, we present a terminology for preBCR signaling modules that distinguishes a pro-proliferative ""phase-I"" module from a pro-differentiative ""phase-II"" module. This terminology might serve as a framework to better address shared oncogenic mechanics of preB cell stage BCP-ALL.",0
"Although CAR T cell therapy is increasingly used to treat relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 20%-30% of patients do not respond, and few clinical predictors of response have been established, especially in the pediatric population. A deeper analysis of CAR T cell infusion products, along with the apheresis product used as the starting material for CAR T cell manufacturing, provides valuable insights for predicting clinical outcomes. We analyzed infusion products and CD4/8-selected T cell starting materials from pediatric and young adult patients on a single-center study with relapsed/refractory B cell ALL who were undergoing treatment with CD22 CAR T cells and evaluated differences between T cells from responders and non-responders (NCT023215612). We found that CAR T cells from non-responders had a more differentiated T cell phenotype and overexpressed genes associated with cytotoxicity and exhaustion compared with those of responders. Furthermore, we found that these differences could be tracked back to the apheresis materials prior to CAR T cell manufacturing. Using flow cytometry-based immunophenotypic markers, we developed a scoring system that distinguished non-responders based on T cell phenotype at the time of apheresis. These findings can help inform outcomes for patients and providers as well as provide insights into targeted manufacturing changes to optimize CAR T cell efficacy.",0
"To find what proportion of a broad set of health journals have published on climate change and health, how many articles they have published, and when they first published on the subject. Bibliometric study. We conducted electronic searches in Ovid MEDLINE ALL for articles about climate change and human health published from 1860 to 31 December 2022 in 330 health journals. There were no limits by language or publication type. Results were independently screened by two raters for article eligibility. After screening there were 2932 eligible articles published across 253 of the 330 journals between 1947 and 2022; most (2795/2932; 95%) were published in English. A few journals published articles in the early 90s, but there has been a rapid increase since about 2006. We were unable to categorise the types of publication but estimate that fewer than half are research papers. While articles were published in journals in 39 countries, two-thirds (1929/2932; 66%) were published in a journal published in the UK or the USA. Almost a quarter (77/330; 23%) of the journals published no eligible articles, and almost three-quarters (241/330; 73%) published five articles or fewer. The publication of joint editorials in over 200 journals in 2021 and 2022 boosted the number of journals publishing something on climate change and health. A third of the (112/330; 34%) journals in our sample published at least one of the joint editorials, and almost a third of those (32/112; 29%) were publishing on climate change and health for the first time. Health journals are rapidly increasing the amount they publish on climate change and health, but despite climate change being the major threat to global health many journals had until recently published little or nothing. A joint editorial published in multiple journals increased coverage, and for many journals it was the first thing they published on climate change and health.",0

"Asparaginase is essential for treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Despite the ongoing debate on whether T-ALL and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) are the same disease entity or two distinct diseases, patients with T-LBL often receive the same or similar treatment protocols as those with T-ALL. The outcomes of patients with or without L-asparaginase discontinuation were retrospectively analyzed among four national protocols: Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study (JACLS) ALL-02 and ALL-97 for T-ALL and Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group ALB-NHL03 and JACLS NHL-98 for T-LBL. The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated with the Cox regression model by considering L-asparaginase discontinuation as a time-dependent variable. In total, 199 patients with T-ALL, and 133 patients with T-LBL were included. L-asparaginase discontinuation compromised event-free survival (EFS) of T-ALL patients (ALL-02: HR 3.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-7.90; ALL-97: HR 3.39, 95%CI 1.19-9.67). Conversely, EFS compromise was not detected among T-LBL patients (ALB-NHL03: HR 1.39, 95%CI 0.41-4.68; NHL-98: HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.11-7.60). The effects of L-asparaginase discontinuation differed between T-ALL and T-LBL. We assume that the differential impact results from (1) the inherent differential response to L-asparaginase between them and/or (2) a less stringent assessment of early treatment response in T-LBL than in T-ALL. Given the poor salvage rate of refractory or relapsed T-ALL and T-LBL, optimization of the frontline therapy is critical, and the current study provides a new suggestion for further treatment modifications. However, larger studies in contemporary intensified treatment protocols are required.",0
"Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved identification of natural antioxidants.",1
"This study examines the dynamic short- and long-run causal relationship between South African real house prices and key macroeconomic fundamentals (gross domestic product(GDP), mortgage rate, exchange rate-USDZAR, affordability, household debt to disposable income, unemployment rate, share prices (JSE ALL share index), foreign direct investment, and producer price index) over the period 2000Q1-2019Q4. The study uses a vector error correction model (VECM) to estimate the relationships while accounting for endogeneity and reverse causality. Although, there seems to be a significant association(both short and long-run) between house prices and all macroeconomic fundamental variables, GDP and producer price index appear to have the greatest impact. Further, our results suggest that any short-term disequilibrium in house prices always self-corrects in the long-run.",0
"A recent landmark study reported the value of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover pathogenic abnormalities of clinical significance in patients with pediatric B-ALL enrolled in the UKALL2003 clinical trial (Schwab et al., 2023). NGS, as whole genome sequencing (WGS) or targeted NGS (t-NGS), was combined with previous data (cytogenetics, FISH and MLPA) from 351 pediatric patients with precursor B-ALL who lacked a defining genetic abnormality (B-other ALL). This integration of tests classified patients into 15 distinct subtypes, each one characterized by a specific abnormality. The most frequent subtypes were defined by abnormalities of PAX5, DUX4, ZNF384, an ABL class, and an ETV6::RUNX1-like with a gene expression profile similar to the typical ETV6::RUNX1 but without the specific abnormality. Quite conspicuously, WGS detected some classical abnormalities that remained undetected by standard cytogenomic methods. This application of NGS integrated into standard cytogenomic assays is a decisive advance in classifying patients with B-other ALL into distinct subtypes characterized by unique genomic changes. The addition of NGS improved the identification of pathogenic abnormalities and refined the classification as well as the risk stratification to determine clinical prognosis.",0
"We have developed a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method to measure the glucosides of cis- and trans-resveratrol as well as the free isomers in commercial wines. The procedure utilises a novel technique for calibration requiring only the trans-resveratrol in pure form and the conversion of the glucosides to the free isomers by hydrolysis with β-glucosidase. Only 20 μl of sample is needed for direct injection without prior preparation, and isocratic elution separates the 4 compounds of interest in approximately 50 min. Calibration curves are linear, and stable for several months. Recovery was around 100% for all compounds, and replicate analyses gave coefficients of variation of 0.4–6.7%. The limits of sensitivity were 0.2 and 0.1 μmoles l−1 for the glucosides and free isomers of cis- and trans-resveratrol, respectively. A preliminary survey of sixteen wines from eight countries or regions revealed the presence of all four compounds in fourteen; the glucosides of resveratrol were present in higher concentrations than the free isomers in five of the wines.",1
"Extraction, resolution, and determination of the trans-hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were performed in 82 orange juices derived from the most important blood and blond varieties grown in Italy. Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties. The statistical model was used to recognize some mixtures of blood and blond juices.",1
"Amaranth, spinach, carrot, potato, tomato and brinjal were selected for the study. The total phenolic content (TPC) was determined spectrophotometrically with folin-ciocalteu (FC) phenol reagent in vegetables both raw and cooked. The results were expressed in gallic acid equivalent (GAE) mg/100 g of fresh weight. The antioxidant activity (AOA) was determined in raw and cooked preparations by measuring the coupled autoxidation of β-carotene and linoleic acid emulsion. A significant reduction was found in TPC and AOA, after shallow frying of spinach, amaranth and potato, but in case of shallow fried carrot, tomato and brinjal, the TPC and AOA increased significantly.",1
"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and hyperlipidemia are severe complications of L-Asparaginase (L-Asp) during the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Herein, we reported a 9-year-old B-ALL boy who underwent abnormal hypertriglyceridemia and CVST presenting as seizures and disturbance of consciousness twice during the induction therapy. Fortunately, he survived treatment with anticoagulant and lipid-lowering therapy. No thrombophilia-related gene mutation was detected, but a heterozygous mutation in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene was identified. His neurological symptoms were managed with short-term anticoagulant therapy and long-term lipid-lowering therapy. This case illustrated the manifestation and potential pathogenesis of CVST and highlighted the essentiality of screening baseline lipid profile and dyslipidemia- and thrombophilia-related gene mutation.",0
"Quantitative and qualitative analyses of phenolic acid fractions (free and liberated after acidic and basic hydrolysis) in three aubergine cultivars (Black Beauty, Solara F1, Epic F1) were performed. Qualitative and quantitative HPLC analysis was done using a reversed phase system applying a LaChrom type (Merck) liquid chromatograph equipped with a DAD detector. Caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, gallic, protocatechuic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids were found in all investigated aubergine fruits. Studies suggested that the fruits of the Black Beauty cultivar contained the highest level of phenolic acid (35.14 µg/g fresh matter) with protocatechuic acid (22.36 µg/g fresh matter) predominating. Fruits of other cultivars contained the following amounts of the compounds studied: Solara F1 24.82 µg/g fresh matter and Epic F1 18.76 µg/g fresh matter. Moreover, it was shown that free phenolic acids had the highest share in the total sum of aubergine phenolic acids",1
"The landscape of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment is rapidly evolving, with new therapies challenging traditional treatment paradigms. While allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remains essential for many high-risk patients, advances in measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring and the increasing use of immunotherapies in earlier treatment lines have reshaped transplant decision-making. Improvements in donor availability, conditioning strategies, and post-transplant care have expanded access and improved survival, yet relapse and toxicity remain major challenges. This review examines the evolving role of allo-HCT in ALL, highlighting key advancements and ongoing challenges.",0
"As effective therapies for relapse and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remain problematic, novel therapeutic strategies are needed. Artemis is a key endonuclease in V(D)J recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Inhibition of Artemis would cause chromosome breaks during maturation of RAG-expressing T- and B-cells. Though this would block generation of new B- and T-cells temporarily, it could be oncologically beneficial for reducing the proliferation of B-ALL and T-ALL cells by causing chromosome breaks in these RAG-expressing tumor cells. Currently, pharmacological inhibition is not available for Artemis. According to gene expression analyses from 207 children with high-risk pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemias high Artemis expression is correlated with poor outcome. Therefore, we evaluated four compounds (827171, 827032, 826941, and 825226), previously generated from a large Artemis targeted drug screen. A biochemical assay using a purified Artemis:DNA-PKcs complex shows that the Artemis inhibitors 827171, 827032, 826941, 825226 have nanomolar IC50 values for Artemis inhibition. We compared these 4 compounds to a DNA-PK inhibitor (AZD7648) in three patient-derived B-ALL cell lines (LAX56, BLQ5 and LAX7R) and in two mature B-cell lines (3301015 and 5680001) as controls. We found that pharmacological Artemis inhibition substantially decreases proliferation of B-ALL cell lines while normal mature B-cell lines are not markedly affected. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs (which regulates Artemis) using the DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648 had minor effects on these same primary patient-derived ALL lines, indicating that inhibition of V(D)J hairpin opening requires direct inhibition of Artemis, rather than indirect suppression of the kinase that regulates Artemis. Our data provides a basis for further evaluation of pharmacological Artemis inhibition of proliferation of B- and T-ALL.",0
"Phenolics and volatiles are the compounds mainly responsible for the desirable flavour of extra virgin olive oils and therefore to a large extent determine the degree of consumer preference for this highly regarded product. The effect of both (i) the nature of the cultivar and (ii) the degree of ripening of the olive fruit on the biophenolic and volatile profiles of six different Spanish varieties (Arbequina, Cornicabra, Morisca, Picolimón, Picudo and Picual) and their corresponding virgin olive oils was determined in this study. A clear and statistically significant difference was observed for the oleuropein content, the main phenolic component found in the olive varieties studied. Demethyloleuropein was only found in the Arbequina variety and its content doubled during the ripening process. Verbascoside steadily increased throughout fruit maturation and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside was the most abundant anthocyanin in all the varieties studied. Within the same cultivar a relationship between the oleosides content in the fruit and the presence of secoiridoids in the virgin olive oils was observed; however, the ratio between biophenols content in the olive fruit and in the virgin olive oil varied significantly for each of the cultivars studied (ranging from 2.3 for Picudo and 28 for Picolimon). The major volatile component was the C6 aldehyde fraction whose content varied greatly between the different varieties studied: E-2-hexenal content ranged from 20.5mg of internal standard (4-methyl-2-pentanol) per kg of oil in the Arbequina variety to 3.1mg/kg for Cornicabra; the amount of hexanal ranged from 1.75mg/kg in Morisca to 0.70mg/kg for Picual samples.",1
"A method for the identification and quantification of phenolic compounds from artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) heads, juice, and pomace by HPLC with diode array and mass spectrometric detection was developed. Among the 22 major compounds, 11 caffeoylquinic acids and 8 flavonoids were detected. Quantification of individual compounds was carried out by external calibration. Apigenin 7-O-glucuronide was found to be the major flavonoid in all samples investigated. 1,5-Di-O-caffeoylquinic acid represented the major hydroxycinnamic acid, with 3890 mg/kg in artichoke heads and 3269 mg/kg in the pomace, whereas in the juice 1,3-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (cynarin) was predominant, due to the isomerization during processing. Total phenolic contents of approximately 12 g/kg on a dry matter basis revealed that artichoke pomace is a promising source of phenolic compounds that might be recovered and used as natural antioxidants or functional food ingredients.",1
"The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) during induction and consolidation, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), is a standard of care for patients with Philadelphia (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The goal of this study was to compare results of allo-HCT according to the type of TKI used pre-transplant, either imatinib, dasatinib or both. This was a retrospective, registry-based analysis including adult patients with Ph-positive ALL treated with allo-HCT between years 2010-2022. The analysis included 606 patients pre-treated with imatinib, 163 with dasatinib and 94 with both imatinib and dasatinib. Allo-HCTs were performed in first complete remission from either unrelated (56%), matched sibling (36%) or haploidentical donors (8%). Relapse incidence at 2 years was 26% in the imatinib group and 21% in the dasatinib group and 19% in the imatinib + dasatinib group (P = .06) while non-relapse mortality was 19%, 15%, and 23%, respectively (P = .37). No significant differences were found for leukemia-free survival (55% vs. 63% vs. 58%, P = .11) and overall survival (72% vs. 76% vs. 65%, P = .32). The incidence of grade 2-4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD was comparable across study groups, while the incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD was significantly increased for patients pre-treated with dasatinib alone (20%) than in the imatinib group (10%) or imatinib + dasatinib group (13%) (P = .002). On multivariate analysis a chance of GVHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was significantly decreased while the risk of grade 3-4 acute GVHD was increased for the dasatinib compared to imatinib group (hazard ratio, HR = 1.27, P = .048 and HR = 2.26, P = .0009, respectively). This study provides no evidence for the advantage of one TKI over another in terms of LFS and OS. However, the use of dasatinib is associated with increased risk of severe acute GVHD and decreased GRFS.",0
"L-Asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli (EcA) is extensively employed in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, immunogenic responses frequently result in therapeutic failure. This study aims to identify residues involved in EcA immunogenicity and to propose structural modifications that may reduce antigenic potential or facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to inhibit such interactions. To achieve this, we investigate the sites of interaction of HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele and EcA by crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) using recombinantly expressed proteins. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed the proper folding of the expressed enzymes, ensuring their structural integrity. Additionally, XL-MS allowed us to experimentally determine the structure of HLA-DRB1*07:01, which was previously unknown. Structural analysis and sequence alignment revealed immunogenic epitopes on the enzyme surface, particularly near the active site and at K288, a highly reactive residue. Our findings highlight key immunogenic sites on EcA, particularly residues 53-58, 283-289, and K288, which represent promising targets for reducing immunogenicity while preserving enzymatic function. These proposed modifications should be experimentally validated to ensure enzyme activity is maintained while effectively mitigating immune responses. SIGNIFICANCE: Hypersensitivity to Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginase (EcA) remains one of the main challenges in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), often forcing patients to interrupt a therapy that could be lifesaving. In this study, we mapped at the structural level how EcA interacts with the HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele, one of the main genetic factors associated with these adverse reactions. By identifying specific regions of the enzyme that trigger the immune response, especially residue K288, we offer a foundation for targeted modifications that may reduce immunogenicity without affecting enzymatic activity. These findings provide a concrete path toward developing safer EcA variants and bring us closer to more effective and personalized treatments.",0
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a new mechanism of cellular communication, by delivering their cargo into target cells to modulate molecular pathways. EV-mediated crosstalk contributes to tumor survival and resistance to cellular stress. However, the role of EVs in B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (B-ALL) awaits to be thoroughly investigated. We recently published that ActivinA increases intracellular calcium levels and promotes actin polymerization in B-ALL cells. These biological processes guide cytoskeleton reorganization, which is a crucial event for EV secretion and internalization. Hence, we investigated the role of EVs in the context of B-ALL and the impact of ActivinA on this phenomenon. We demonstrated that leukemic cells release a higher number of EVs in response to ActivinA treatment, and they can actively uptake EVs released by other B-ALL cells. Under culture-induced stress conditions, EVs coculture promoted cell survival in B-ALL cells in a dose-dependent manner. Direct stimulation of B-ALL cells with ActivinA or with EVs isolated from ActivinA-stimulated cells was even more effective in preventing cell death. This effect can be possibly ascribed to the increase of vesiculation and modifications of EV-associated microRNAs induced by ActivinA. These data demonstrate that ActivinA boosts EV-mediated B-ALL crosstalk, improving leukemia survival in stress conditions.",0
"The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place during processing and the storage period.",1
"Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves (205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, and red raspberries.",1
"T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) is the most common cancer in children, with a low survival rate because of drug resistance and a high recurrence rate. Targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs can reduce their side effects and improve their efficacy. The abnormality of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/ mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) pathway plays a key role in T-ALL occurrence. AZD5363 is a selective Akt inhibitor with promising therapeutic potential for tumors encoded by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. However, the toxicity and side effects have limited its application in treating T-ALL. This study aimed to design a delivery system for targeting AZD5363 to T-ALL by sgc8c aptamer designed as mesoporous silica (mSiO",0
"Purpose of current study was to categorize WHO defined B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) cases into 3 cytogenetic risk groups (good, intermediate and poor) and to see their correlation with age, NCI risk criteria and treatment response. Clinical and diagnostic details were collected for 78 newly diagnosed B-ALL patients which included bone marrow morphology, flow cytometry immunophenotyping, karyotyping, FISH and RT-PCR. Study cohort comprised 44/78 (56.4%) children including 3 infants and 34/78 (43.6%) adults. Median age for paediatric group was 6 years (3 months-17 years) and for adults was 40.5 years (18 to 75 years). According to NCI risk criteria, excluding infants, 54 (72%) were high risk and 21 (28%) were standard risk. Clonal cytogenetic abnormality was detected in 59/78 cases (75.6%), while 19/78 (24.4%) cases showed normal karyotype. There was significant association of cytogenetic risk groups to age distribution (",0
"Acute Leukemia (AL) is a prevalent subtype of leukemia, mainly including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The disease burden of acute leukemia has significantly shifted in recent years. The aim of this study was to evaluate global trends in the burden of disease for ALL and AML from 1990 to 2021. Data on ALL and AML, encompassing incidence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and associated risk factors from 1990 to 2021, were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) were calculated to assess the changes in age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR). The associations between cancers burden and socio-demographic index (SDI) were also analyzed. Compared with 1990, the global incidence of ALL and AML in 2021 is 5.69% and 82.25% higher, respectively. During the period from 1990 to 2021, ASMR in ALL showed a large decline, while AML remained stable. The ASDR of both showed a downward trend (EAPC = -2.11% and -0.84%). Regions and countries with higher SDI also have higher rates of acute leukemia. The burden of AML is mainly distributed in the elderly population, while the burden of ALL is heavier in children. Smoking, high BMI, and occupational exposure to benzene and formaldehyde are major risk factors for AML and ALL-related deaths. Acute leukemia remains one of the major global public health challenges, but there are different trends in different regions and countries. Acute myeloid leukemia has had a higher disease burden in recent years than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Policy makers should develop targeted public health policies to further reduce the global burden of acute leukemia.",0
"Urinary symptoms are one of the most common reasons for emergency visits in females of pediatric age group and can be associated with various conditions like infections (most common), sexual trauma and rarely neoplastic processes. Here, we report a case of a 7-year-old female who presented in the emergency multiple times with the complaints of urinary symptoms and vaginal pain and was empirically treated with antibiotics and antifungals without symptomatic improvement. Her blood tests, physical examination during this time remained unrevealing. She was then transferred to our institution on her third emergency visit for further evaluation. On imaging studies, she was noted to have expansile lesions on her vertebral body at the L4 and T6 levels with compressive myelopathy with multiple bone and soft tissue lesions throughout her lower extremities. Patient developed saddle anesthesia requiring emergent decompression and biopsy of the epidural mass with the final pathology coming back as B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. B-ALL/B-LBL is the most common pediatric hematologic malignancy and usually presents with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, bone pain and bleeding. Occasionally, atypical presentations like bone and joint pain, osteoporosis, palpable paravertebral mass have been described. However, this is the first case report to describe a very unusual and unfamiliar presentation of this disease causing significant diagnostic difficulty resulting in delayed treatment. This case report can aid as a reminder that unusual pain or any nonspecific manifestations in pediatric patients, refractory to common treatment should be investigated with extreme diligence not to miss this neoplastic process.",0
"A survey of resveratrol content in wines of the four Aragón designations of origin (Borja, Cariñena, Calatayud and Somontano) was carried out. Concentrations of trans- and cis-resveratrol isomers of 98 commercial wines of the four designations of origin, from several vintages, were analyzed by means of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Concentration of trans-resveratrol ranged from 0.32 to 4.44 mg/l in red wines and from 0.12 to 2.80 mg/l in rosé wines. cis-Resveratrol levels ranged from 0.20 to 5.84 mg/l in red wines and from 0.02 to 3.17 mg/l in rosé wines. The grape variety influenced resveratrol contents in wines from the different regions. The highest trans/cis ratios were found in Somontano (4.50) and Calatayud wines (2.90), both of the Tempranillo variety. However, a discriminant analysis applied to the concentrations did not show significant differences between young red wines nor between rosé wines of the four designations of origin.",1
"The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.",1
"Early B-cell development is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level and comprises the consecutive differentiation stages B-cell progenitor, pro-B-cell and pre-B-cell. These entities provide the cells of origin in B-cell precursor acute lymphoid leukemia (BCP-ALL) that show aberrations of developmental transcription factors (TFs), representing major oncogenic drivers. Analysis of physiological TFs in these developmental entities helps us to understand their normal and disturbed activities and regulatory connections. Here, we focused on NKL-subclass homeodomain TF NKX6-3, which is active in both normal B-cell progenitors and TCF3::PBX1 fusion gene-positive BCP-ALL cases. By performing siRNA-mediated knockdown and forced expression experiments in BCP-ALL model cell lines, we established a gene regulatory network for NKX6-3 together with TALE-class homeodomain TFs IRX1 and MEIS1, as well as ETS-TF SPIB. Importantly, NKX6-3 was activated by TCF3::PBX1, underlying their co-expression in BCP-ALL. Furthermore, comparative expression profiling analysis of public BCP-ALL patient data revealed TGFb-pathway in-hibitor CD109 as a downregulated target gene of NKX6-3. TGFb-signalling, in turn, enhanced NKX6-3 expression, indicating mutual activation. Finally, RNA-seq analysis of BCP-ALL cell line RCH-ACV after NKX6-3 knockdown revealed MPP7 as an upregulated target gene of both NKX6-3 and TCF3::PBX1, revealing a role for the HIPPO-pathway in B-cell progenitors and TCF3::PBX1-positive BCP-ALL. Collectively, our data introduce novel players and regulatory connections to normal and aberrant TF-networks in B-cell progenitors to serve as potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets.",0
"Phenolic compounds in kiwifruit pulp were separated and characterized by reversed-phase HPLC, and the effect of juice processing on the phenolic composition was studied. Fractionation of phenolic compounds was achieved through selective elution from C-18 cartridges prior to preconcentration and subsequent separation by HPLC. Strongly acidic compounds were identified as derivatives of coumaric and caffeic acids, including chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and a derivative of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The weakly acidic fraction contained epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins (B3, B2, or B4 and oligomers). Flavonols were present as the glycosides of quercetin (glucoside, rhamnoside, and rutinoside) and kaempferol (rhamnoside and rutinoside). Phenolic compounds were present, at levels of <1-7 mg/L, in clarified juice. The concentration of phenolics was highest after high-temperature short-time treatment (HTST) of juice. Hydrolysis of hydroxycinnamic acids occurred after enzyme addition and HTST treatment. The flavonol glycoside composition is the best identifier of kiwifruit juice.",1
"Supplementations of soy (full fat and defatted) and barley flours to wheat flours at 5, 10, 15 and 20% levels were carried out to test the effects on organoleptic and nutritional evaluation of the supplemented bread. Additions of 15% barley flour, 10% soy flour (full fat and defatted), 15% barley plus full fat soy flour and 15% barley plus defatted soy flour to wheat flour produced acceptable breads. However, substitution of soy (full fat and defatted) and barley flours to wheat flour separately and in combinations at 20% levels did not produce organoleptically acceptable bread. Various nutritional parameters, such as protein, fat, total lysine, protein digestibility (in vitro), sugars, starch digestibility (in vitro), total and available minerals, antinutrients, dietary fibre and β-glucan were determined in supplemented and control bread. Increasing the level of substitution from 5 to 10% of full fat and defatted soy flour to wheat flour significantly (P<0.05) increased protein (from 12.1 to 13.7 and 12.4 to 13.8%), lysine (from 2.74 to 3.02 and 2.76–3.05 mg/100 g protein) and total calcium (from 70.2 to 81.4 and 71.9–81.8 mg/100 g) contents. However, there was also an increase in phytic acid (238–260 and 233–253 mg/100 g), polyphenol (324–331 and 321–329 mg/100 g) and trypsin inhibitor activity (193–204 and 193–198 TIU/g). When barley flour was substituted separately, and in combinations, with full fat and defatted soy flour up to 15%, this significantly increased the contents of protein, total lysine, dietary fibre and β-glucan. It may be concluded that breads supplemented with barley and defatted soy flour, up to a 15% level, are organoleptically and nutritionally acceptable.",1

"Information on phyto-oestrogen intake in various populations has been scanty until now, primarily because data on the content of these compounds in foods were lacking. We report here on expansion of the Finnish National Food Composition Database (Fineli) with values for the plant lignans matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. The values, expressed as aglycones, were based on food analyses (mainly GC-MS) or imputed from analytical data for 180 foods for lignans and 160 foods for isoflavones; additionally, over 1000 values were derived from the recipe database of Fineli. Average intake of these phyto-oestrogens was calculated using food consumption data of the National Dietary Survey FINDIET 1997, which was carried out in a random sample of the adult population in five areas in Finland. The dietary data were collected by 24 h recall =2862). The mean lignan intake was 434 (standard deviation (SD) 1575) microg/d and the mean isoflavone intake was 788 (SD 673) microg/d. Women had a higher lignan density (microg lignans/MJ) in their diet than men (P<0.05). Men had a higher mean daily isoflavone intake, 902 (SD 368) microg, than women, 668 (SD 963) microg (P<0.05). The sources of lignans were many: seeds, cereals, fruit, berries and vegetables. The main sources of isoflavones appeared to be processed meat products/sausages containing soya as an ingredient, and legumes as such. The average intake of lignans and isoflavones in Finland seems to be low, but intake varies throughout the population.",1
"The roles of isoflavones in the prevention of several hormone-dependent cancers and osteoporosis are of great interest. Despite many pharmacokinetics studies of the isoflavones, the actual types of conjugates circulating in the body and the position(s) of conjugation sites on the flavone skeleton are still uncertain because, in general, conjugated compounds in biological fluids have been evaluated by measuring the free aglycones obtained after selective enzymatic hydrolysis. Using an high-performance (HPLC)-UV-diode-array detector (DAD) method combined with solid-phase extraction, we have obtained HPLC profiles of isoflavone glycosides [daidzin (Din) and genistin (Gin)] and of intact isoflavone metabolites in human plasma: daidzein, genistein, daizein-7-glucuronide, daidzein-4'-glucuronide, genistein-7-glucuronide, genistein-4'-glucuronide, daidzein-7-sulfate, daidzein-4'-sulfate, genistein-7-sulfate, and genistein-4'-sulfate. We investigated the plasma profile of intact isoflavone metabolites in plasma obtained 1 to-7 h after orally administration of 50 g of kinako (baked soybean powder) to two healthy volunteers. The results of DAD analysis indicated that the main isoflavone metabolite peaks were identified on the HPLC chromatogram. Furthermore, the intact glycosides Din and Gin were detected in 1-h plasma samples by their positive electrospray ionization mass spectra, demonstrating that the glycosides Din and Gin can be absorbed from the gut.",1
"Olive oil phenolic constituents have been shown, in vitro, to be endowed with potent biological activities including, but not limited to, an antioxidant action. To date, there is no information on the absorption and disposition of such compounds in humans. We report that olive oil phenolics, namely tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, are dose-dependently absorbed in humans after ingestion and that they are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, an increase in the dose of phenolics administered increased the proportion of conjugation with glucuronide.",1

"Gut microbial dysbiosis persists months after intensive cancer treatment in children and adolescents. This prospective study compared the intestinal microbiome of children 1-3 years after completion of Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster protocol (BFM)-based pediatric ALL (PALL) treatment and healthy controls. To induce a favorable shift in the bacterial composition of the intestines in PALL with gut microbiome disruptions, 8 weeks of physical activity and probiotic consumption were used. Blood analyses and 16S rRNA sequencing for the gut microbiome were performed on 16 pediatric cases and 16 healthy controls. Significant differences in bacterial diversity were found between pre- and post-intervention, respectively (Shannon index, 3.22±0.45 vs. 3.47±0.24, p=0.04; Simpson index, 0.10±0.05 vs. 0.06±0.02, p=0.02; and Chao1 index, 693.88±238.58 vs. 794.23±116.34, p=0.04). Furthermore, the increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus casei (5.04E-03±1.62E-02 vs. 2.92E-02±5.03E-02, p=0.04) and the increase in some strains of Veillonella, a bacterial genus recently linked to improved physical fitness, were identified. Promisingly, the exercise program combined with dairy probiotics increased bacterial richness and diversity.",0
"Utilizing RNA sequence (RNA-Seq) splice junction data from a cohort of 1841 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients we define transcriptionally distinct isoforms of ARID5B, a risk-associated gene identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS), which associate with disease survival. Short (S) and long (L) ARID5B transcripts, which differ in an encoded BAH-like chromatin interaction domain, show remarkable correlation to the isoform splicing pattern. Testing of the ARID5B proximal promoter of the S & L isoforms indicated that both are functionally independent in luciferase reporter assays. Increased short isoform expression is associated with decreased event-free and overall survival. The abundance of short and long transcripts strongly correlates to B-ALL prognostic stratification, where B-ALL subtypes with poor outcomes express a higher proportion of the S-isoform. These data demonstrate that the analysis of independent promoters and alternative splicing events are essential for improved risk stratification and a more complete understanding of disease pathology.",0
"Paediatric relapse/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is notoriously difficult to treat. This group of heavily pre-treated patients needs effective agents that can rapidly control the disease while not having significant toxicity. Homoharringtonine (HHT) has been widely used in children with acute myeloid leukaemia, but there is little information on T-ALL. In this case series, HHT, in combination with other agents, achieved good response in five paediatric patients with T-ALL. The in vitro drug profiling in one patient demonstrated clinical correlation with HHT activity. The study sheds light on the potential of precision medicine for patients with relapsed/refractory leukaemia.",0
"The biological regulation of transcription factors (TFs) and repressor proteins is an important mechanism for maintaining cell homeostasis. In B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) TF abnormalities occur at high frequency and are often recognized as the major driving factor in carcinogenesis. We provide an in-depth review of molecular mechanisms of six major TF rearrangements in B-ALL, including DUX4-rearranged (DUX4-R), MEF2D-R, ZNF384-R, ETV6-RUNX1 and TCF3-PBX1 fusions, and KMT2A-R. In addition, the therapeutic options and prognoses for patients who harbor these TF abnormalities are discussed. This review aims to provide an up-to-date panoramic view of how TF-based oncogenic fusions might drive carcinogenesis and impact on potential therapeutic exploration of B-ALL treatments.",0
"As there is a continuous interest to characterise wines of different origin with regard to their antioxidant activity, we have examinated the phenolic content of some Aglianico red wines by gradient elution reversed-phase HPLC and UV diode array detection (DAD). The potential health benefits of red wine might partly be due to the presence of natural flavonoids, such as catechin, epicatechin, cis-resveratrol, quercetin and myricetin. Catechin and epicatechin were quantified by direct sample injection, while the determination of free cis-resveratrol, trans-resveratrol, myricetin and quercetin was preceded by a concentration step on SPE C18 cartridges. The quantitative analysis was accomplished by standard addition using beta-naphthol as internal standard. The phenolic content detected in this study in Aglianico red wines ranges from 49.7 to 68.6 mg/L. As expected the level of cis-resveratrol was lower than that of trans-resveratrol, with average values of 0.27 and 0.86 mg/L, respectively. The presence of hydroxytyrosol and myricetin in some Aglianico wines was ascertained by on-line spectral comparison.",1
"Seed coats and cotyledons from 25 Brazilian and 3 Peruvian bean cultivars were investigated in relation to their phenolic profiles and antioxidant capacity. Condensed tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonols such as kaempferol and quercetin glycosides were mostly found in seed coats. Cotyledons were rich in phenolic acids, such as ferulic, sinapic, chlorogenic, and other hydroxycinnamic acids. In general, the seed coat color pattern and the type of cultivar showed an important influence on the variability of phenolic profiles and levels, respectively. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity assessed by the DPPH method were higher in seed coats than in cotyledons. The antioxidant capacity had a significant correlation with condensed tannins for all samples and with total anthocyanins in black and red seed coats, whereas in cotyledons, it was more related to the total phenolic content.",1
"The phytoalexin resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) in edible peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) varieties grown in Turkey was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatographic diode array and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric detection. trans-Resveratrol in six peanut varieties, five pistachio varieties, and four market samples ranged between 0.03 and 1.92 microg/g. The Cerezlik 5025 peanut (1.92 +/- 0.01 microg/g) and Ohadi pistachio genotype (1.67 +/- 0.01 microg/g) had significantly higher trans-resveratrol contents. Peanuts contained 0.03-1.92 microg/g (av = 0.84 microg/g) of trans-resveratrol, whereas pistachio contained 0.09-1.67 microg/g (av = 1.15 microg/g). With exposure to UV light for 1 min, trans-resveratrol concentrations of samples ranged from 0.02 to 1.47 microg/g and those of cis-resveratrol from 0.008 to 0.32 microg/g. The occurrence of resveratrol in peanut and pistachio was confirmed by total ion chromatograms (TIC) of bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide derivatives of resveratrol isomers and comparison of the mass spectral fragmentation data with those of a resveratrol standard. Formation of the cis-isomer in pistachios was higher than in peanuts.",1
"Five commercially important spices, namely cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg and mace, were subjected to gamma-irradiation using a dose of 10 kGy, which is recommended for microbial decontamination. Various phenolic acids present in these spices were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In clove and nutmeg, quantitatively significant changes were noted in some of the phenolic acids upon irradiation. The content of gallic and syringic acids in irradiated clove increased by 2.2- and 4.4-fold respectively, whereas in irradiated nutmeg many of the phenolic acids showed wide increases and decreases in the range of two- to sixfold compared with the control samples. No qualitative and major quantitative changes were, however, observed in the phenolic acids of cinnamon, cardamom and mace upon irradiation. The possibility that gamma-radiation induced breakdown of tannins could be responsible for the changes in phenolic acids content of clove and nutmeg is discussed.",1
"Several anterolateral stabilization procedures have been developed recently to address rotational instability of the knee. Currently, these procedures tend to be systematically used by some practitioners. However, antero-lateral structures of the knee (including the anterolateral ligament, ALL) have a self-healing potential which can reduce the need to perform an antero-lateral procedure. In this study, it was hypothesized that early post-traumatic immobilization of the knee with a knee brace would allow partial healing of antero-lateral structures and also allow control of the pivot shift, thus avoiding antero-lateral extra-articular stabilization. The objective of this study was to compare the severity of pivot shift between two groups of patients who all experienced anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear and respectively underwent post-traumatic immobilization of the knee versus no immobilization. This was a comparative, multicentric (three centers' study) retrospective, consecutive study including 168 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction between May and September 2022. The application or not of post-traumatic immobilization and its duration, the severity of pivot shift observed in the operating room under general anesthesia, the presence of anterolateral lesions as revealed by MRI and the patients' pre-injury sport activity were recorded. A grade 3 pivot shift was found in 44 patients (27%). It was more frequently observed in the group without a brace compared to the group with a knee brace (18 patients out of 36: 50% versus 26 patients out of 132: 19.7%; p = 0.0012). Wearing a brace, whether hinged (OR = 0.221, [0.070-0.652]; p = 0.006) or not (OR = 0.232, [0.076-0.667]; p = 0.0064), was protective from the risk of developing a significant pivot shift. This study demonstrated that the presence of pivot-shift was lower in the patients that had an early post-injury knee brace before their ACL reconstruction. Based on this result, systematic brace placement could be advocated for in patients after knee trauma. III, prognostic retrospective case-control study.",0
"This study was aimed to review Virtual Reality's (VR) impact on pain, anxiety, opioid usage, physiological and behavioural responses, and patients' experience during wound care (WC) in adults. We searched multiple databases (Embase, Medline ALL, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar) from inception until January 27th, 2023. Included studies compared VR alone or as an adjunct to standard WC with standard WC or other distraction methods, in adults with burn or non-burn-related wounds. The risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised parallel-group and crossover trials. The review followed PRISMA guidelines for reporting. Fourteen studies were eligible for inclusion. The meta-analysis was limited to studies comprising solely of adult participants. VR reduced pain intensity compared to standard WC in all study designs. Despite not being included in the meta-analysis due to reasons such as mixed population or lack of sufficient statistical data, other studies showed significant pain reduction using VR. Additionally, VR improved patients' experience of WC. No clear effect was found on other outcomes including anxiety, opioid usage and physiological and behavioural responses. VR shows promise in reducing acute pain and enhancing patients' experience of WC. The observed variations in the effects of VR at group and individual levels indicate the need for a personalised treatment plan by selecting the right VR for the right patient given at the right time.",0
"PDGFRB-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an ABL-class Ph-like ALL subtype, typically exhibits chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. Precise diagnosis and therapies are crucial for improving outcomes. Here, we report a case of a 9-year-old male harboring a TERF2::PDGFRB fusion, exhibiting primary resistance to dasatinib, but achieving a remarkable response to imatinib. Subsequent combination therapy with blinatumomab induced sustained bone marrow remission. These findings highlight the variability in tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sensitivity among PDGFRB-rearranged ALL cases, supporting early treatment switching upon poor response. Notably, the combination of blinatumomab and imatinib may be an effective treatment strategy for PDGFRB-rearranged ALL.",0
"Mitochondria are critical for cellular energy, and while large deletions in their genome (mtDNA) are linked to primary mitochondrial diseases, their significance in cancer is less understood. Given cancer's metabolic nature, investigating mtDNA deletions in tumors at various stages could provide insights into disease origins and treatment responses. In this study, we analyzed 148 bone marrow samples from 129 pediatric patients with B-cell (B-ALL) and T-cell (T-ALL) acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis, remission, and relapse using long-range PCR, next-generation sequencing, and the Splice-Break2 pipeline. Both T-ALL and B-ALL exhibited significantly more mtDNA deletions than did the controls, with T-ALL showing a ~100-fold increase and B-ALL a ~15-fold increase. The T-ALL samples also exhibited larger deletions (median size > 2000 bp) and greater heterogeneity, suggesting increased mitochondrial instability. Clustering analysis revealed distinct deletion profiles between ALL subtypes and across disease stages. Notably, large clonal deletions were detected in some B-ALL remission samples, including one affecting up to 88% of mtDNA molecules, which points toward treatment-driven selection or toxicity. A multivariate analysis confirmed that disease type, timepoint, and WHO subtype significantly influenced mtDNA deletion metrics, while age and gender did not. These findings suggest that mtDNA deletion profiling could serve as a biomarker for pediatric ALL and may indicate mitochondrial toxicity contributing to late effects in survivors.",0
"Measurement of minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) in B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL) has become a routine clinical evaluation tool and remains the strongest predictor of treatment outcome. In recent years, new targeted anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibody-based and cellular therapies have revolutionized the treatment of the high-risk B-ALL. The new treatments raise challenges for diagnostic flow cytometry, which relies on the presence of specific surface antigens to identify the population of interest. So far, reported flow cytometry-based assays are developed to either achieve a deeper MRD level or to accommodate the loss of surface antigens post-target therapies, but not both. We developed a single tube flow cytometry assay (14-color-16-parameters). The method was validated using 94 clinical samples as well as spike-in and replicate experiments. The assay was well suited for monitoring response to targeted therapies and reached a sensitivity below 10 The assay allows for sensitive disease detection of B-ALL MRD independent of CD19 and CD22 expression and allows uniform analysis of samples regardless of anti-CD19 and CD22 therapy.",0
"The phenols, α-tocopherols, fatty acids and oxidative stability of six monovarietal virgin olive oils (VOOs) were determined. Fourteen phenolic compounds were detected and quantified by solid phase extraction and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones were the main components in all samples. Pinoresinol was the most abundant component in lignan fraction. The total phenol content of these monovarietal oils varied from 66.82 mg/kg in “Neb Jmel” oil to 662.74 mg/kg in “El Hor” oil. A wide range of α-tocopherol contents was also noticed; it varied from 141.94 mg/kg in “Semni” variety to 364.23 mg/kg in “Jdallou” variety. With regard to pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids were found at variable concentrations: with median values of 11.33 and 3.10 mg/kg, respectively. Among the studied varieties, “Oueslati” and El Hor were characterized by the lowest levels of palmitic and linoleic acids and the highest values of oleic acid.",1
"In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.",1
"Paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism resulting in increased mortality and morbidity. We hypothesised that apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, would safely reduce venous thromboembolism in this patient population. PREVAPIX-ALL was a phase 3, open-label, randomised, controlled trial conducted in 74 paediatric hospitals in 9 countries. Participants aged 1 year or older to younger than 18 years with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B cell or T cell) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (B cell or T cell immunophenotype) and a central venous line in place throughout induction were randomly assigned 1:1 to standard of care (SOC, ie, no systemic anticoagulation) or weight-adjusted twice-daily apixaban during induction. Randomisation was performed centrally and stratified by age (those <10 years or those ≥10 years). Participants weighing 35 kg or less were administered 2·5 mg twice daily of apixaban as a 2·5 mg tablet, 0·5 mg tablets, or 0·4 mg/mL oral solution, while those weighing more than 35 kg were administered weight-adjusted prophylactic doses using 0·5 mg tablets or the 0·4 mg/mL oral solution twice daily. Primary outcomes were assessed by a blinded central adjudication committee. The primary efficacy outcome for the intention to treat population was the composite of symptomatic or clinically unsuspected venous thromboembolism, the primary safety outcome was major bleeding, and secondary safety outcomes included clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding. Patients were screened for venous thromboembolism by ultrasound and echocardiogram at the end of induction. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02369653) and is now complete. Between Oct 22, 2015, and June 4, 2021, 512 participants were randomly assigned and included in analyses (222 [43%] female and 290 [57%] male; 388 [76%] White, 52 [10%] Asian, 24 [5%] Black or African American, and 48 [9%] other races; and 122 [24%] Hispanic or Latino ethnicity). During a median follow-up period of 27 days (IQR 26-28), 31 (12%) of 256 patients on apixaban had a composite venous thromboembolism compared with 45 (18%) of 256 participants receiving SOC (relative risk [RR] 0·69, 95% CI 0·45-1·05; p=0·080). Two major bleeding events occurred in each group (RR 1·0, 95% CI 0·14-7·01; p=1·0). A higher incidence of CRNM bleeding, primarily grade 1 or 2 epistaxis, occurred in the apixaban group (11 [4%] of 256 participants) compared with the SOC group (3 [1%] of 256; RR 3·67, 95% CI 1·04-12·97, p=0·030). The most frequent grade 3-5 adverse events in both groups were thrombocytopenia (n=28 for the apixaban group and n=20 for the SOC group) or platelet count decreased (n=49 and n=45), anaemia (n=77 and n=74), febrile neutropenia (n=27 and n=20), and neutropenia (n=16 and n=17) or neutrophil count decreased (n=22 and n=25). Five deaths occurred, which were due to infection (n=3 in the SOC group), cardiac arrest (n=1 in apixaban group), and haemorrhagic cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (n=1 in the SOC group). There was one apixaban-related death (coagulopathy and haemorrhage after cardiac arrest of unknown cause). PREVAPIX-ALL is, to our knowledge, the first trial assessing primary thromboprophylaxis using a direct oral anticoagulant in paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or lymphoma. No statistically significant treatment benefit was identified in participants receiving apixaban. Major and CRNM bleeding were infrequent overall, but a higher incidence of CRNM bleeding (primarily epistaxis in younger children) occurred in participants receiving apixaban. For patients deemed to be at particularly high risk of thrombosis, PREVAPIX-ALL provides encouraging safety data for the use of apixaban in clinical settings in which the potential benefits are thought to outweigh the risk of bleeding.

"The influence of cultivar and picking date on the phenolic content of walnut liqueur was investigated using HPLC with a PDA detector. Ten phenolic compounds, namely gallic, protocatechuic, ellagic, chlorogenic (5-caffeoylquinic), syringic, p-coumaric and sinapic acids, as well as (+)-catechin, 1,4-naphthoquinone and juglone were detected. The walnut liqueur under analysis was made of the cultivars ‘Franquette’ and ‘Elit’, on two sampling dates (June 30th and July 7th). A close interaction between cultivar and sampling date was noticed for most of the phenolics analyzed. The content levels of the main phenolic compounds under investigation were highest in ‘Franquette’ at the end of June and lowest in ‘Elit’ on the second or both sampling dates, except for syringic acid. A strong influence of cultivar choice and picking date was observed. The content levels of most phenolics were higher in liqueur prepared from the cultivar ‘Franquette’, than in ‘Elit’.",1
"Breviscapine, is the total flavonoid components (the content of scutellarin > or =85%) extracted from the dried whole plant of Erigeron breviscapus (VANT.) HAND.-MAZZ, and its preparations are generally used in the clinic for the treatment of cerebral and cardio-vascular diseases in China. In this paper, the metabolites of breviscapine in the urine of rats after oral administration were investigated. The ten metabolites were isolated by open-column chromatography and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by MS, NMR spectroscopy including (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and NOESY (nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy), enzymatic hydrolysis and chemical evidence. The ten metabolites were identified as scutellarein-6,7-di-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-1), scutellarein (M-2), 6-O-methyl-scutellarin (M-3), 6-O-methyl-scutellarein (M-4), scutellarein-6-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-5), scutellarein-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-6), scutellarin (M-7), scutellarein-7-O-sulfate (M-8), apigenin-5-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-9), and apigenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide (M-10) respectively. The results of this study indicated that the metabolites of brevisvapine were excreted in rats urine as glucuronidated, sulfated or methylated forms, as well as the aglycone of scutellarin-scutellarein after oral administration, and the metabolic pathways were also proposed.",1

"Collision risks between femoral tunnels during combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction have been reported. However, studies on collision risks between tibial tunnels and optimal ALL tibial tunnel orientation are lacking. To analyze the optimal orientation of the ALL tibial tunnel to minimize collisions with the ACL tibial tunnel while preventing injury to the saphenous nerve in combined reconstruction. Descriptive laboratory study. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postoperative computed tomography (CT) images of patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction using the anteromedial portal technique were analyzed. Only patients with preoperative MRI scans including thin-cut images (<1 mm) were included for 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. Patients who underwent ALL reconstruction or had poorly 3D-reconstructed essential structures were excluded to ensure accurate reproduction of bony attachments and landmarks associated with ALL. Bony structures of the knee joint, including the proximal tibia with the actual ACL tibial tunnel, were reconstructed from the postoperative CT scans. The greater saphenous vein (GSV), which runs together with the saphenous nerve, was reconstructed from the preoperative MRI and subsequently transferred to the CT model, maintaining the appropriate positional relationship. Twelve orientations of the ALL tunnel (at 10° intervals, ranging from 0° to 20° anteriorly and from 0° to 30° distally) were simulated with the final 3D model, starting from the ALL tibial footprint (midpoint between the Gerdy tubercle and the fibular head, 10 mm distal to the joint line), to measure the distances between the ALL tunnel trajectory and other structures (ACL tibial tunnel, GSV) by each orientation. A total of 35 out of 304 patients were included in this study. An anteriorly oriented ALL tunnel decreased the minimum distance to the ACL tibial tunnel (MD-ACL) and increased minimum distance to the GSV (MD-GSV) (all The optimal orientations of the ALL tibial tunnel to avoid collision with the ACL tibial tunnel and prevent saphenous nerve injury are 10° anterior to 30° distal and 20° anterior to 30° distal for far-cortex drilling techniques, starting from the midpoint between the Gerdy tubercle and the fibular head, 10 mm distal to the joint line.",0
"Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) is a unique subtype of immature T-cell ALL that was initially associated with a dramatically inferior prognosis compared with non-ETP T-cell ALL (Not-ETP) when it was first described in 2009. Analyses of larger patient cohorts treated with more contemporary regimens, however, have shown minimal survival differences between ETP and Not-ETP. In this manuscript, we use representative cases to explore therapeutic advances and address common clinical questions regarding the management of children, adolescents, and young adults with ETP-ALL. We describe our recommended treatment approach for a child or adolescent with newly diagnosed ETP-ALL, with an emphasis on the prognostic significance of induction failure and detectable minimal residual disease and the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplant in first remission. We discuss the interplay between the ETP immunophenotype and genomic markers of immaturity in T-cell ALL. Finally, we review novel therapeutic approaches that should be considered when managing relapsed or refractory ETP-ALL.",0
"Significant disparities exist in laparoscopic training opportunities for surgeons in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). ALL-SAFE is an innovative, low-cost training system for LMIC surgeons' laparoscopic development. However, strategies to implement and scale ALL-SAFE are unstudied. We aimed to assess the impact of implementation science strategies on ALL-SAFE uptake in Liberia, a novel and low-resource context. This study used implementation science approaches to evaluate ALL-SAFE uptake in three Liberian hospitals: John F. Kennedy Medical Center, Phebe, and ELWA. Five validated implementation strategies of program orientation, local champions, network weaving, feedback mechanisms, and practical supervision were piloted. All five strategies were implemented at two hospitals, while four strategies, excluding clinician supervision, were implemented at the final site as a pseudo-control, to evaluate the impact of resource-intensive supervision. Participants included surgical consultants, residents, and medical students. Engagement was assessed with mixed methods including participant number, practice hours, module completion rates, and strategy feasibility through end-user interviews. Across three hospitals, 33 participants used ALL-SAFE for 87.8 total training hours (5,268 min). Participant numbers varied across sites (N Our study is one of the first to evaluate implementation science strategies for laparoscopic training in sub-Saharan Africa. The implementation bundles of five validated strategies were considered feasible by Liberian surgeons in both urban and rural hospitals. Mixed methods suggested a positive association between engagement and the resource-intensive practical supervision strategy. Future studies should focus on quantifying individual strategy contributions with rigorous implementation designs and assessing sustainability strategies.",0
"The majority of pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) strains are generally non-pathogenic to chickens; however, they can induce severe illness and high mortality rates in pigeons, leading to substantial economic repercussions. The genomes of 11 PPMV-1 isolates from deceased pigeons on meat pigeon farms during passive monitoring from 2009 to 2012 were sequenced and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction and phylogenetic analysis. The complete genome lengths of 11 isolates were approximately 15,192 nucleotides, displaying a consistent gene order of 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. ALL isolates exhibited the characteristic motif of 112RRQKRF117 at the fusion protein cleavage site, which is characteristic of velogenic Newcastle disease virus. Moreover, multiple mutations have been identified within the functional domains of the F and HN proteins, encompassing the fusion peptide, heptad repeat region, transmembrane domains, and neutralizing epitopes. Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the F gene unveiled that all isolates clustered within genotype VI in class II. Further classification identified at least two distinct sub-genotypes, with seven isolates classified as sub-genotype VI.2.1.1.2.2, whereas the others were classified as sub-genotype VI.2.1.1.2.1. This study suggests that both sub-genotypes were implicated in severe disease manifestation among meat pigeons, with sub-genotype VI.2.1.1.2.2 displaying an increasing prevalence among Shanghai's meat pigeon population since 2011. These results emphasize the value of developing pigeon-specific vaccines and molecular diagnostic tools for monitoring and proactively managing potential PPMV-1 outbreaks.",0
"To determine the frequencies of different cytogenetic abnormalities in patients of Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Northern Pakistan. It was descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Hematology Department of a Tertiary care referral institute from June 2015 to July 2017. All newly diagnosed cases of Acute Leukemia were analyzed. Cytogenetic analysis was performed on bone marrow aspirate samples using Giemsa-trypsin banding technique. Karyotypes were identified and interpreted according to ISCN criteria. A total of 355 newly diagnosed patients of Acute Leukemia were analyzed. Out of these, 180 patients had AML and 175 had ALL. In Acute Myeloid Leukemia chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 28.2 % cases. Of these the common ones included t(8;21),t(15;17),+8, Inversion 16 and Monosomy 7. Other abnormalities included Complex karyotype, Down's syndrome related AML, Hyperdiploidy, del 16q,-8,+Y and t(3p;17q)del 10.

"CD99, a type I transmembrane protein, emerges as a promising therapeutic target due to its heightened expression in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This characteristic renders it a potential marker for minimal residual disease detection and an appealing target for antibody-based treatments. Previous studies have revealed that a mouse monoclonal antibody, mAb MT99/3, selectively binds to CD99, triggering apoptosis in T-ALL/T-LBL cells while preserving the integrity of healthy cells. By targeting CD99, mAb MT99/3 suppresses antigen presentation and disrupts T cell functions, offering promise for addressing hyperresponsive T cell conditions. To facilitate clinical translation, we developed a humanized ScFv variant of mAb MT99/3, termed HuScFvMT99/3 in ""ScFvkh"" design. Structural analysis confirms its resemblance to the original antibody, and the immunoreactivity of HuScFvMT99/3 against CD99 is preserved. The fully humanized version of antibody HuMT99/3 was further engineered, exhibiting similar binding affinity at the 10",0
"This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August (RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied to the olive orchard.",1
"Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is among the most prevalent hematological malignancies in children. Despite an overall cure rate approaching 90%, a subset of patients still experiences relapse, even with advanced therapeutic interventions. Research into the molecular characteristics and prognostic markers of fusion gene-negative (FG-negative) pediatric ALL remains limited. To address this gap, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) on 54 FG-negative ALL cases from our center. Our results indicated that neither specific mutations nor tumor mutational burden significantly influenced relapse risk. Notably, we identified a significant downregulation of CADPS in FG-negative pediatric ALL patients who relapsed. The expression levels and prognostic significance of CADPS were further validated using data from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) cohort, where lower CADPS expression was associated with reduced event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001 for both). Cox regression analyses were subsequently employed to identify OS-related factors and to construct a prognostic prediction model. Notably, this model demonstrated a significant correlation with therapeutic targets. In conclusion, our findings support the potential of CADPS expression as a novel biomarker for prognostic stratification in FG-negative pediatric ALL patients.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of blood cancer in children. Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may set stages for ALL development. LncRNAs are emerging as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for ALL. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the expression of lncRNA GJA9-MYCBP and PVT1 in blood samples of ALL and healthy individuals. As a case-control study, 40 pairs of ALL and healthy individual samples were used. The expression of MYC and each candidate lncRNA was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Any possible association between the expression of putative noncoding RNAs and clinicopathological characteristics was also evaluated. LncRNA GJA9-MYCBP and PVT1 were significantly upregulated in ALL samples compared with healthy ones. Similarly, mRNA levels of MYC were increased in ALL samples than control ones. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated a satisfactory diagnostic efficacy (p-value <.0001), suggesting that lncRNA GJA9-MYCBP and PVT1 may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for ALL. Linear regression analysis unveiled positive correlations between the expression level of MYC and lncRNA GJA9-MYCBP and PVT1 in ALL patients (p-values <.01). In this study, we provided approval for the clinical diagnostic significance of lncRNA GJA9-MYCBP and PVT1that their upregulations may be a diagnostic biomarker for ALL.",0
"Our objective was to identify whether procalcitonin (PCT) and C Reactive protein (CRP) are useful biomarkers for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL) and febrile neutropenia (FN). We included patients ≥ 15 years of age as existing literature on them is limited. In this prospective observational study, high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and PCT were estimated for all patients at baseline, 48 hours, and 96 hours after administration of broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics. The level of these parameters was then correlated with bacteremia, requirement of antibiotic augmentation, septic shock, ICU admission, prolonged hospitalisation, and death. We analysed 33 episodes of FN. Bacteremia was seen in 12% and augmentation of antibiotics was done in 30% of the episodes. Two patients had septic shock; no death or ICU admission was observed. Prolonged hospitalisation was required in 36% of the episodes. The hsCRP and PCT peaked at 48 hours, and the PCT level was significantly higher in the group with bacteremia, antibiotic augmentation, and prolonged hospitalisation. The area under the curve (AUC) for PCT (at 48 hours) was greater than hsCRP for antibiotic augmentation and prolonged hospitalisation. As a supplement to clinical decision making, serial monitoring of PCT should be done. Levels of PCT at 48 hours of starting antibiotic therapy (≥ 0.82ng/ml) can be used for early augmentation of antibiotic therapy to prevent complications of FN in patient undergoing treatment for ALL.",0
"Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.",1
" The formation of phenolic diterpenes in the leaves of rosemary plants grown under Mediterranean climate was investigated. Low precipitation coincided with high solar radiation during the summer, resulting in water and light stress of the plants. The highest concentrations of the major diterpenes carnosic acid and carnosol were found during the winter and the lowest concentrations during the summer, which is likely to be the result of their enzymatic conversion in the presence of singlet oxygen. All other diterpenes followed different trends during the season. The concentration of carnosic acid increased with the relative water content of the leaf but decreased with increasing solar radiation and temperature. 11,12-di-O-Methylisorosmanol was found for the first time in rosemary leaves.",1
"Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage. This information should make it possible to select strawberries with an optimal content of bioactive compounds.",1
"To quantify the rates and identify risk factors for the complications of central venous access devices (CVADs) removal in children. Retrospective (2018-2023) review of children undergoing CVADs removal at a single institution. Data are reported as frequency, percentages and median. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors associated with difficult removal. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to identify the age cut-off and positive likelihood ratio (+LH) for the indwelling time associated with complicated removal. We identified 208 CVAD removals with a median age of 7.2 (0.2-18.4) years including 116 (55.8%) males. The median CVAD placement duration was 1.26 years (0.4-5.7) years. Indications for insertion included acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL; 78/208, 37.5%), lymphomas (31/208, 14.9%), other malignancies (58/208, 27.9%). Removal indications included completion of treatment (144/208, 69.2%), infection (22/208, 10.6%), malfunction (7/208, 3.4%) and other reasons (35/208, 16.8%). There were 20 (9.6%) complications characterised by difficulty removing the CVAD. Complicated removals were more likely to occur in children with ALL as the primary diagnosis ( In our experience, almost 10% of CVAD removals in children result in complications. These findings are associated with an indwelling time >2 years; strategies to prevent complicated removals should be considered in children requiring long-term central venous access.",0
"The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and contents of soluble and total phenolic acids in a wide range of vegetables consumed in Finland. The determinations were performed from the pooled samples (14 potato and 45 other vegetable samples). Soluble phenolic acids were extracted with methanolic acetic acid and a tentative quantification was performed by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were determined by HPLC after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. Chlorogenic acid derivatives were the most dominant soluble phenolic acids, while caffeic acid was the most dominant phenolic acid aglycone in the samples studied. Highest contents of soluble phenolic acids were found in raw and cooked potato peels: 23–45mg/100g fresh weight calculated as aglycones. In addition, pot-grown lettuces, Chinese cabbage, broccoli, carrot, aubergine, Jerusalem artichoke, peanut and most of the boiled and peeled potato tubers contained more than 5mg/100g of soluble phenolic acids calculated as aglycones. Among the best vegetable sources of total phenolic acids were potatoes, with contents varying from 7.9mg/100g (cooked and peeled Rosamunda variety) to 52mg/100g (cooked peel of Van Gogh variety), and red cabbage, carrot, aubergine, Jerusalem artichoke, broccoli, pot-grown lettuce, spinach, radish and red beet, with contents from 11mg/100g (spinach) to 52mg/100g (pot-grown lettuce Lollo Rosso). Variation in the phenolic acid contents of the vegetables was either moderate or considerable and needs further research.",1
"Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) are active contributors in metastasis and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment. At least some of the EVs carry tumor surface molecules such as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and/or checkpoint inhibitors, and potentially could interact with T cells or CAR T cells. Upon contact with T cells, EVs could alter their phenotype and functions by triggering signaling through TCR or CAR reprogramming them to escape immune response. We hypothesize that EVs that possess TAA on the surface will probably interact with CAR T cells which can recognize and bind corresponding TAA. This interaction between EVs and CAR T cells may change the outcome of CAR T-based cancer immunotherapy since it should affect CAR T cells. Also, EVs could serve as adjuvants and antigenic components of antitumor vaccines. Herein, we isolated EVs from B cell precursor leukemia cell line (pre-B ALL) Nalm-6 and demonstrated that recognition and binding of CD19",0
"Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) remains a major clinical challenge, as most patients eventually relapse following standard treatments and are left with limited therapeutic options. Although b-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T cell therapy has recently shown remarkable efficacy in select patients, broader implementation is hindered by its reliance on autologous cells, prolonged manufacturing timelines, high costs, and severe immune-related toxicities. These challenges have prompted an urgent demand for safer, more accessible, and rapidly applicable immunotherapeutic alternatives. CBMC (cord blood mononuclear cells) were cultured with irradiated BMMC (bone marrow mononuclear cells) from RRMM patients in the presence of defined cytokines, aiming to develop a new therapeutic immune cell product for RRMM. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics, including non-MHC-restricted and MHC-restricted cytotoxicity mechanisms, were analyzed using surface marker profiling, cytokine secretion assays, in vitro cytotoxicity assays, functional and blocking assays. Antitumor activity was evaluated in xenograft mouse models using MM.1 S and RPMI-8226 cells. We successfully generated CD8 TPNC represents a novel cytotoxic lymphocyte product generated through tumor-driven priming. Their dual recognition capacity, functional versatility, and favorable safety profile highlight their potential as a scalable and personalized immunotherapy platform for hematologic malignancies.",0
"Twenty-six white wines of “Appellation of Origin of High Quality”, covering all viticultural areas of Greece were assayed for their polyphenolic content, using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector. Further, the antiradical activity and reducing power of the wines were evaluated. In both cases, the antioxidant potency of the wines was correlated with the total polyphenol concentration, as well as with the concentration of the two major classes of white wine polyphenols, hydroxycinnamates and flavanols. It was found that wines contain in average 324.7 mg l−1 total hydroxycinnamates (THC) and 52.2 mg l−1 total non-hydroxycinnamates (TNHC), (catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid). The antiradical activity was correlated principally with total phenols (THC+TNHC) and with THC, but poorly with TNHC. By contrast, TNHC were found to exert sound reducing effect, as opposed to THC which were weakly correlated with the reducing power.",1
"We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) (maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin = 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.",1
"Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits and vegetables. Apart from imparting color to plants, ACs also have an array of health-promoting benefits. In this research, the amounts of major ACs of 15 pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties obtained from Yazd province were determined. The major ACs detected in the studied varieties were as follows: delphinidin 3-glucoside (2.19–16.29 mg/L), delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside (2.36–63.07 mg/L), pelargonidin 3-glucoside (0.26–1.36 mg/L), pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside (0.01–8.11 mg/L), cyanidin 3-glucoside (5.78–30.38 mg/L), and cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside (4.39–166.32 mg/L). The effect of storage time of unprocessed and pasteurized juices on ACs content of four selected varieties was also studied. Average degradation percentage of each AC was between 23.0 and 83.0% during 10 days at 4 °C. Moreover, in pasteurized juices average degradation of ACs was 42.8 ± 0.5% after 10 weeks storage at 4 °C.",1
"Minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) is the most important independent prognostic factor for patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-LL). MRD post therapy has been incorporated into risk stratification and clinical management, resulting in substantially improved outcomes in pediatric and adult patients. Currently, MRD in B-ALL is most commonly assessed by multiparametric flow cytometry and molecular (polymerase chain reaction or high-throughput sequencing based) methods. The detection of MRD by flow cytometry in B-ALL often begins with B cell antigen-based gating strategies. Over the past several years, targeted immunotherapy directed against B cell markers has been introduced in patients with relapsed or refractory B-ALL and has demonstrated encouraging results. However, targeted therapies have significant impact on the immunophenotype of leukemic blasts, in particular, downregulation or loss of targeted antigens on blasts and normal B cell precursors, posing challenges for MRD detection using standard gating strategies. Novel flow cytometric approaches, using alternative strategies for population identification, sometimes including alternative gating reagents, have been developed and implemented to monitor MRD in the setting of post targeted therapy.",0
"High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is a cornerstone of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment but poses a risk for delayed clearance and associated toxicities. While hydration is standard to enhance methotrexate (MTX) excretion, the relationship between urine output (UO) and time to MTX clearance remains underexplored. We conducted a retrospective study of pediatric ALL patients treated with HD-MTX at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between August 2023 and February 2025. Patients were stratified into higher (H-UO) and lower urine output (L-UO) groups using a 5.0 mL/kg/hr cutoff. Clinical outcomes including time to MTX normalization, delayed MTX clearance, hospitalization duration, and use of adjunctive diuretics were analyzed. Thirty-nine patients were included. The H-UO group showed significantly faster MTX clearance (2.0 vs. 4.0 days, P = 0.0035), lower incidence of delayed clearance (18.2% vs. 70.6%, P = 0.0025), and shorter hospital stays (5.0 vs. 7.0 days, P = 0.019). Diuretic use was higher in the L-UO group, primarily as a reactive measure. No significant difference in MTX-related major toxicities was observed. Higher UO is associated with more efficient time to MTX clearance and shorter hospitalization in pediatric ALL patients receiving HD-MTX. Prospective studies are warranted to optimize supportive care protocols.",0
"To evaluate brain MRI findings in children and young adults after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL) and associate results with clinical and neurological symptoms. We reviewed pre- and post-CAR-T cell therapy brain MRIs of B-ALL patients aged 25 years or younger who underwent therapy between April 2015 and October 2023 at a single institution. MRI abnormalities were categorized as no change, exacerbation of preexisting lesion, or newly developed lesion. Clinical CAR-mediated toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) grades, were recorded. Patients were grouped into those with and without 'exacerbated/new lesion,' and clinical and neurological symptoms were compared using Fisher's exact test. Sixteen patients with pre- and post-CAR brain MRIs (median age 16 years [interquartile range, 11-21]; 9 males, 7 females) were included in the analysis. Post-CAR brain abnormalities were observed in 81% (13/16) of patients, including white matter (WM) signal changes (12/16), leptomeningeal enhancement (1/16), and cerebellar embolic infarction (1/16). Of the post-CAR WM lesions, 50% (6/12) were exacerbated, 33% (4/12) were newly developed, and 17% (2/12) remained unchanged compared to pre-CAR brain MRI. No difference in CRS (p = 0.079) or ICANS grades (p > 0.99) was observed between patients with and without 'exacerbated/new lesions'. Children and young adults with B-ALL can develop brain MRI abnormalities after CAR T-cell therapy, predominantly WM signal changes. These brain abnormalities did not show an association with higher CRS or ICANS grade. Question Brain MRI findings after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for B-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (B-ALL) and their association with clinical and neurological symptoms are not well understood. Findings Brain MRI abnormalities, mostly white matter changes, were seen in 81% of patients but were not associated with CAR-mediated toxicities. Clinical relevance Brain MRI abnormalities, commonly observed post-CAR T-cell therapy, do not correlate with the severity of CAR-related toxicities, aiding in the clinical management and monitoring of these patients.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a disease of lymphocyte origin predominantly diagnosed in children. While its 5-year survival rate is high, resistance to chemotherapy drugs is still an obstacle. Our aim is to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to Asparaginase, Daunorubicin, Prednisolone, and Vincristine resistance and identify potential inhibitors via docking. Three datasets were accessed from the Gene Expression Omnibus database; GSE635, GSE19143, and GSE22529. The microarray data was analyzed using R4.2.0 and Bioconductor packages, and pathway and protein-protein interaction analysis were performed. We identified 1294 upregulated DEGs, with 12 genes consistently upregulated in all four resistant groups. KEGG analysis revealed an association with the PI3K-Akt pathway. Among DEGs, 33 hub genes including MDM2 and USP7 were pinpointed. Within common genes, CLDN9 and HS3ST3A1 were subjected to molecular docking against 3556 molecules. Following ADMET analysis, three drugs emerged as potential inhibitors: Flunarizine, Talniflumate, and Eltrombopag. Molecular dynamics analysis for HS3ST3A1 indicated all candidates had the potential to overcome drug resistance, Eltrombopag displaying particularly promising results. This study promotes a further understanding of drug resistance in ALL, introducing novel genes for consideration in diagnostic screening. It also presents potential inhibitor candidates to tackle drug resistance through repurposing.",0
"Grit from different hulled barley cultivars was subjected to extrusion cooking and the effect of extrusion moisture and temperature on the antioxidant properties was studied. A significant decrease in the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) was observed upon extrusion and a further decrease of 8–29% in TPC and 13–27% in TFC was observed when both the feed moisture and extrusion temperature were increased. The antioxidant activity (AOA) increased significantly upon extrusion and this increase was the highest (36–69%) at 150°C and 20% feed moisture. The increase in feed moisture and temperature significantly increased the metal chelating activity. The reducing power decreased significantly upon extrusion as compared to their corresponding control samples. Extrusion lead to a greater increase in non-enzymatic browning (NEB) index however, increasing the moisture content of feed decreased the NEB index by 3–29% (at 180°C) and 1–17% (150°C), while increasing the temperature increased the NEB significantly.",1
"This work determined the phenolic composition of the seed coat and the cotyledon of two varieties of dark peas (Pisum sativum L), Fidelia and ZP-840, by HPLC-PAD and HPLC-MS. High concentrations of glycosides of quercetin, luteolin and apigenin were found in the seed coat of both varieties of peas. Minor concentrations of monomers and dimers of proanthocyanidins were identified. The cotyledon mainly contains hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic compounds and some of the flavone and flavonol glycosides found in the seed coat. Two conjugated compounds with malic acid, trans p-coumaroyl-malic acid and p-hydroxybenzoyl-malic acid were identified in the cotyledon and in the seed coat, and the stilbene trans-resveratrol-3-glucoside, only in the seed coat. These compounds had not been previously reported in peas. The results obtained allow an overview of the distribution of the phenolic compounds in the seeds of these varieties of peas, and contribute to the knowledge of the implications of these compounds in the dietary intake.",1
"To determine the frequency of different types of acute leukaemia and their subtypes along with associated aberrant CD markers. Descriptive study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Immunology Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, National University of Medical Sciences, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from November 2021 to October 2023. All samples received for flow cytometric immunophenotyping with suspicion of acute leukaemia were included in the study. Cells were stained with fluorochrome labelled monoclonal antibodies against lineage-specific cluster of differentiation (CD) markers through a lyse-wash procedure. Acquisition and analysis were done using multi-parameter BD FACS Canto II Flow cytometer and BD FACS Diva software, respectively. Data were entered and analysed using SPSS v 23.0. Over a period of 2 years, a total of 1,115 suspected patients were tested for acute leukaemia. Among them, 728 (65.3%) were males and 387 (34.7%) were females, with mean age 28 ± 21 years, ranging from 1 week to 87 years. Among a total of 875/1115 (78.5%) diagnosed cases of acute leukaemia, AML was the most common leukaemia present in 408/875 (46.6%) patients followed by B-ALL and T-ALL in 384/875 (43.8%) and 70/87 (8%) patients, respectively (p = 0.5712). Aberrant CD markers were detected in 109/875 (12.5%) leukaemias (p = 0.0628). The most common aberrant CD markers in B-ALL were CD13 and CD33 present in 30/384 (7.8%) cases separately. Among AML and T-ALL most common aberrant CD markers were CD7 and CD33 present in 25/408 (6.13%) and 7/70 (10%) cases, respectively. Special consideration should be given to the presence of aberrant CD markers when assigning lineages to acute leukaemias. They may be important diagnostic, prognostic, and management tools for institution of immunotherapy. Aberrant CD markers, Acute leukaemia, CD Markers, Flow cytometry, Immunophenotyping.",0
"Isogarcinol (ISO), a cytotoxic polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinol isolated from the edible fruits of Garcinia multiflora. However, synergistic combination of ISO and dexamethasone (DEX) to overcome leukemia glucocorticoid resistance has never been investigated. Therefore, in this study, the effects of ISO in combination with DEX was conducted on leukemia in vivo and glucocorticoid resistance in vitro. As a result, the combination of the two compounds could efficiently inhibit leukemia progression in mice and reverse DEX resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Jurkat cells. Significantly, our findings indicated that c-Myc may be a potential target of ISO, as it is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by the combination of ISO and DEX in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that ISO and DEX inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and promotes the nuclear translocation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which activates target genes NR3C1 and TSC22D3, leading to apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Hence, our results suggest that ISO, as a safe and effective food-derived agent, can enhance the anti-leukemia effects of DEX.",0
"The use of psychotropic medications in children and adolescents is increasing worldwide. However, caregivers' perspectives regarding the use of these medications in young people remain underexplored. To explore caregivers' perspectives towards the use of psychotropic medications in the treatment of mental disorders in young people. A systematic search was conducted across five databases (MEDLINE (ALL), Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus) using a search strategy encompassing the concepts 'psychotropic medications', 'mental health', 'attitudes', 'young people', and 'caregivers' to identify relevant records published up to 25 March 2024. Records were screened by title and abstract against predefined criteria, followed by full-text review. Data were synthesised and presented in tables. Quality assessment was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. After screening 1,296 records, 17 studies were eligible for inclusion. Findings were categorised into caregiver attitudes ( This review emphasises the importance of acknowledging and addressing caregiver concerns and actively involving them in the decision-making process. The substantial heterogeneity in study designs, measures, and participant characteristics reinforces the need for future research to employ validated instruments alongside both qualitative and interventional approaches to capture caregiver perspectives and the contextual factors that shape them.",0
"In September 2016, ponatinib was approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance/intolerance to prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors and patients with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We conducted a post-marketing all-case surveillance to study the safety and efficacy of ponatinib in clinical practice, focusing on arterial occlusive events. Data from 724 patients were collected for 2 years from the initiation of ponatinib. The arterial occlusive events were reported in 6.49% (47/724) with an exposure-adjusted incidence rate of 6.8/100 person-years. The risks associated with arterial occlusive events were age and comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes. At 104 weeks, the cumulative major molecular response rate in patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia was 67.2% and the complete cytogenetic response in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 80.0%. Furthermore, the estimated 1-year overall survival rate was 98.5% for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and 68.6% for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This surveillance demonstrated that ponatinib has a favorable safety and efficacy profile in Japanese patients and also showed the necessity of closely monitoring arterial occlusive events in older adults and patients with predisposing factors for atherosclerosis.",0
"ALL is the most common childhood cancer globally, accounting for about 25% of cancer diagnoses in children under 15 years old. This study aimed to investigate the temporal trends and disparities in the global burden of ALL following the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study. Data were obtained from the GBD 2021 database, covering 204 countries and territories across five socio-demographic index (SDI) regions. Incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were analyzed, with age-standardized rates (ASRs) calculated for comparability. Joinpoint regression models and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were used to assess temporal trends from 1990 to 2021. Globally, the incidence of ALL increased from 98,149 cases in 1990 to 103,727 cases in 2021, while the prevalence rose from 237,056 to 386,813 cases. However, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) decreased from 1.8 to 1.4 per 100,000 persons (EAPC = -0.64), and the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) increased from 4.1 to 5.4 per 100,000 persons (EAPC = 1.4). Notably, a significant decrease in incidence was observed in high-middle, middle, and high SDI regions During 2019-2021. Deaths and DALYs showed a downward trend, with the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) and age-standardized DALY rate (ASDALYs) decreasing across all SDI quintiles. The highest burden was observed in children under 5 years, with significant disparities between high-middle and middle SDI regions. The study highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global burden of ALL, particularly in high-middle and middle SDI regions. Tailored prevention strategies and improved healthcare access are needed to address disparities and reduce the burden of ALL. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of the pandemic on ALL. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of the pandemic on ALL outcomes and the development of targeted interventions for high-risk populations.",0
"A method is proposed for the extraction and purification of the phenolic acids present in edible vegetable oils. An extract containing the acid compounds of virgin olive oils was investigated by HPLC. Four characteristic peaks were identified: vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid), vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde), p-coumaric acid (trans-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid). These substances were confirmed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. Their determination in some edible vegetable oils was carried out by HPLC with spectrofluorimetric and UV detectors.",1
"In a previous study we evaluated the effects of brewing on compounds potentially involved in the antioxidant defence system. The objectives of this paper were to determine organic acids and to characterize the quantity and quality of phenolic acids in four Italian lager beers. The data obtained on organic acids are in line with the values reported in the literature for malic, pyruvic, lactic, acetic, ketoglutaric, citric, succinic, citramalic and fumaric acid. Phenolic acid composition was determined using two different high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodologies: HPLC-ECD (amperometric electrochemical detection) and HPLC-DAD (photodiode array detection). The most common phenolic acid was found to be m-coumaric followed by ferulic, o-coumaric, p-coumaric and 3-OH-benzoic. Vanillic, chlorogenic, homovanillic, p-OH-benzoic, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic, syringic, gallic, protocatechuic, caffeic and finally, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acids were present in small quantities. The amount of phenolic acids is quite low in absolute terms and in relationship to data available in the literature. Statistically significant differences were not found between the two different analytical methods utilized.",1
"Late effects such as neurocognitive issues and fatigue have been reported in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) survivors. Yet, their association is often poorly understood. In this study, we wished to (1) describe neurocognitive difficulties and fatigue in a well-characterized cohort of long-term cALL survivors and (2) explore the risk of having neurocognitive deficits as a function of fatigue.

"The phenolic composition of commercial virgin olive oils (Picual, Hojiblanca, Arbequina and Cornicabra varieties) was studied by high performance liquid chromatography, sampling oils over 1 year. Oils sold in March displayed the lowest polyphenol concentration, particularly in secoiridoid aglycons. In contrast, lignans and tocopherols concentrations were not affected by sampling date. Among varieties, Picual and Cornicabra oils had slightly higher concentrations of polyphenols than Hojiblanca and Arbequina. Overall, the concentration of polyphenols in commercial Spanish virgin olive oils ranged from 330 to 500 mg/kg oil, which is higher than data reported previously. In contrast, 'olive oil' and 'pomace-olive oil' (mixtures of refined and virgin olive oils) had much lower concentrations in polyphenols than virgin olive oil, although higher than other edible vegetable oils. Thus, olive oil can be considered a good source of natural antioxidants. Moreover, the polyphenol and tocopherol contents of virgin olive oils were also found useful for the classification of the different commercial monovarietal oils when analysing the data by chemometric methods.",1
"The interest in the consumption of pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum L.) is, to a large extent, due to its content of bioactive nutrients and their importance as dietary antioxidants. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to determine the effects of salinity and different ripening states of pepper fruits on several compounds with antioxidant properties. Fruits from plants grown under three saline treatments (0, 15, and 30mM NaCl) were collected at three maturity states (green, turning, and red). Antioxidant activity in the hydrophilic (HAA) and lipophilic (LAA) fractions, lycopene, β-carotene, ascorbic acid, total phenolic compounds and reducing sugars were determined. From the nutritional point of view, the red state was the most appropriate state of maturation, since red peppers had the highest levels of lycopene, β-carotene, and sugars and the highest antioxidant activity for both hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions. The effect of salinity depended on the maturity state of the peppers: it had no effect on HAA, β-carotene or sugars, but decreased ascorbic acid and total phenolic compounds, and increased LAA and lycopene. The use of a moderately-saline water was beneficial when peppers were harvested in the red state, by increasing HAA and LAA in fruits, with no significant effects on other parameters.",1
"Given that liver diseases and subsequent increases in liver enzymes are among the most frequent complications observed in leukemia patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs, this study aimed to assess the impact of oral Lcarnitine supplementation on liver enzyme levels the maintenance phase of treatment for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. In this clinical trial, 100 pediatric patients aged >5 years were divided into two groups after obtaining informed consent. The participants were randomly divided into the Lcarnitine and placebo groups. In the Lcarnitine group, patients received 50 mg/kg of Lcarnitine syrup three times a day (every 8 h). Patients were examined for 2 months to receive Lcarnitine syrup and to measure the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The mean changes in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and GGT during the study period were significant in the group treated with Lcarnitine (P < 0.05), although they were not significant in the placebo group (P > 0.05). Also, the levels of ALP, direct bilirubin, PT, and PTT were not significantly different between the two groups. The incidence of side effects was significantly higher in the Lcarnitine group than in the placebo group (18% vs 4%, P = 0.025). The results of this study suggested that a 60-day Lcarnitine treatment can improve liver enzyme levels and thus prevent the extent of liver damage during the treatment of ALL. Based on the results of our study, Lcarnitine supplementation may have a beneficial effect on liver enzyme levels in pediatric ALL patients during the maintenance phase of treatment. https://irct.behdasht.gov.ir/search/result?query=IRCT20201107049296N2, identifier IRCT20201107049296N2.",0

"Resveratrol has been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease and reduced cancer risk. This phytoalexin has been reported in a number of plant species, including grapes, and may be one of the compounds responsible for the health benefits of red wine. Analytical methods for measuring resveratrol in wine and peanuts were adapted to isolate, identify, and quantify resveratrol in several cultivars of peanuts. Aqueous ethanol (80% v/v) extracts from peanuts without seed coats were purified over alumina/silica gel columns and analyzed by reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column. Peanuts from each market type, Virginia, runner, and Spanish, produced in four different locations contained from 0.03 to 0.14 microg of resveratrol/g. Seed coats from runner and Virginia types contained approximately 0.65 microg/g of seed coat, which is equivalent to <0.04 microg/seed. Quantitative analysis of 15 cultivars representing 3 peanut market types, which had been cold stored for up to 3 years, indicated a range of 0.02-1.79 microg/g of peanut compared to 0.6-8.0 microg/mL in red wines.",1
"We evaluated fine motor skills; precision, motor integration, manual dexterity, and upper-limb coordination according to sex and risk stratification in children with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL). We evaluated twenty-nine children in the maintenance phase aged 6 to 12 years with the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-second edition (BOT-2), and sex and age-specific norm values of BOT-2 were used to compare our results. We found lower scores on the upper-limb coordination subtest, p = 0.003 and on the manual coordination composite, p = 0.008, than normative values. Most boys performed ""average"" on both the subtests and the composites, but girls showed lower scores with a mean difference of 7.69 (95%CI; 2.24 to 3.14), p = 0.009. Girls' scale scores on the upper-limb coordination subtest were lower than normative values, with mean difference 5.08 (95%CI; 2.35 to 7.81), p = 0.006. The mean standard score difference in high-risk patients was lower than normative on the manual coordination composite, 8.18 (95%CI; 2.26 to 14.1), p = 0.015. High-risk children also performed below the BOT-2 normative on manual dexterity 2.82 (95%CI; 0.14 to 5.78), p = 0.035 and upper limb coordination subtest 4.10 (95%CI; 1.13 to 7.05), p = 0.028. We found a decrease in fine motor precision in children with a higher BMI, rho= -0.87, p = 0.056 and a negative correlation between older age and lower manual dexterity, r= -0.41 p = 0.026; however, we did not find any correlation with the weeks in the maintenance phase. Fine motor impairments are common in children with ALL in the maintenance phase; it is important to identify these impairments to early rehabilitation.",0
"Ferulic acid (FA) is a low molecular weight phenolic acid that is a common component of the outer layers of cereal grains. It has been implicated in resistance to both insect and fungal pathogens. The FA concentrations of 18 cultivars of 2-row and 6-row barleys, grown in 2 locations, were quantified by HPLC analysis following acid hydrolysis. The FA concentrations ranged from 365 to 605 μg/g dry weight. The concentration of FA varied significantly among the different cultivars of barley. A genetic basis for FA levels is inferred by the similar ranking of the cultivars in both locations. FA levels were also measured by the absorbance at 340 nm of the acid-hydrolyzed extract, and in situ detection of fluorescence intensity of the ground grain using a UMSP80 microspectrofluorimeter. Both of these methods are more rapid than HPLC and may allow the practical screening of FA concentrations in numerous barley lines.",1
"Three different Lactuca sativa L. varieties (Iceberg, Romaine and Baby head) were analysed in order to determine differences in the antioxidant activity, both hydrophilic and lipophilic, and in the total phenolic content of different leaves (stem, inner, medium and outermost leaves). Romaine showed the highest level of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity, and its phenolic content was also higher than that of Iceberg and Baby head. According to leaf position, lipophilic antioxidant activity increased sharply from stem to outermost leaves, suggesting a protective role for the lipophilic antioxidant in mature or light-exposed leaves, while hydrophilic antioxidant activity shows a non-specific distribution. The phenolic content also increased in Romaine from stem to outermost leaves, although no significant changes were observed in Iceberg or Baby head lettuces in this respect.",1
"The studies aimed at explaining the role of cereals as the source of biologically active compounds. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. Dankowskie Zlote and oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko were used in the study. The content of the following biologically active compounds was determined: inositol phosphates, tocopherols, tocotrienols, reduced glutathione, melatonin, phenolic acids as well as the content of microelements (Cu, Zn, Mn and Se). The behaviour of these compounds under extrusion cooking (process temperatures of 120–160–200°), which was taken as a model of hydrothermal processes, was analyzed. Extrusion caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic ones. A decrease in inositol hexaphosphate, depending on the species of cereal, was from 4 to 50%, in tocopherols and tocotrienols, from 63 to 94%, in reduced glutathione, from 20 to 50%, and in melatonin, from 17 to 63%. An increase in the content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) reached from 200 to 300%.",1
"Dietary phytoestrogens may be involved in the occurrence of chronic diseases. Reliable information on the phytoestrogen content in foods is required to assess dietary exposure and disease risk in epidemiological studies. However, there is little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary phytoestrogens in the UK. These results will allow a more accurate estimation of exposure to dietary phytoestrogens.",1
"The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant power and photochemiluminescence methods.",1

"Polish garlic and white and red onions were subjected to blanching, boiling, frying, and microwaving for different periods of time, and then their bioactive compounds (polyphenols, flavonoids, flavanols, anthocyanins, tannins, and ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activities were determined. It was found that blanching and frying and then microwaving of garlic and onions did not decrease significantly the amounts of their bioactive compounds and the level of antioxidant activities ( P > 0.05). The HPLC profiles of free and soluble ester- and glycoside-bound phenolic acids showed that trans-hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic) were as much as twice higher in garlic than in onions. Quercetin quantity was the highest in red onion among the studied vegetables. The electrophoretic separation of nonreduced garlic and onion proteins after boiling demonstrated their degradation in the range from 50 to 112 kDa.",1
"To analyse the effect of HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 allelic mismatches on the outcomes of unrelated donor haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (URD-HSCT), we collected 258 recipients with haematological disease who underwent HLA-10/10 matched URD-HSCT. HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, -DRB3/4/5, -DQA1, -DPA1 and -DPB1 typing was performed for the donors and recipients using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. After excluding 8 cases with DQA1 or DRB3/4/5 mismatches, we included 250 cases with HLA-14/14 matching for further analysis. Our results showed that the proportion of matched DPA1 and DPB1 alleles was only 10.4% (26/250). The remaining 89.6% of donors and recipients demonstrated DPA1 or DPB1 mismatch. In the DPA1 matched and DPB1 mismatched group, accounting for 18.8% (47/250) of the cohort, DPB1*02:01/DPB1*03:01 allelic mismatches were associated with decreased 2-year OS and increased NRM. DPB1*02:02/DPB1*05:01 and DPB1*02:01/DPB1*05:01 mismatches showed no impact on outcomes. Moreover, the specific allelic mismatches observed were consistent with the DPB1 T-cell epitope (TCE) classification as permissive and non-permissive. We innovatively established an analysis method for DPA1 ~ DPB1 linkage mismatch for cases with both DPA1 and DPB1 mismatched, accounting for 70% (175/250) of the total. DPA1*02:02 ~ DPB1*05:01/DPA1*02:01 ~ DPB1*17:01 linkage mismatches were associated with lower 2-year OS, especially among AML/MDS recipients. DPA1*02:02 ~ DPB1*05:01/DPA1*01:03 ~ DPB1*02:01 linkage mismatches showed no impact on outcomes. In conclusion, applying the DPA1 ~ DPB1 linkage mismatch analysis approach can identify different types of mismatches affecting transplant outcomes and provide valuable insight for selecting optimal donors for AML/MDS and ALL recipients.",0
"The enhanced utilization of native L-asparaginase (L-Asp) aims to improve treatment outcomes for adult patients with non-Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this measurable residual disease 2014 (MRD2014) study, we modified our protocol to include an augmented dose of native L-Asp.

"The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut microbial flora to synthesize equol.",1

"Scutellarin is widely used in treating various cardiovascular diseases. Few data are available regarding its metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. The objectives of this study were to develop methods to identify major metabolites of scutellarin in human urine and plasma and to determine simultaneously the parent drug and its major metabolites in human plasma for pharmacokinetic studies. Four metabolites were detected in urine samples by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS), but only one of them was found in plasma. Its structure was confirmed as scutellarein 6-O-beta-D-glucuronide by MS, NMR, and UV absorbance spectra. The plasma concentrations of scutellarin and the major metabolite were simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. After a single p.o. administration of 60 mg of scutellarin to 20 healthy subjects, the plasma concentrations of scutellarin were very low, and its plasma concentration-time curve was also anomalous. Plasma concentration of the major metabolite was comparatively high, and the peak plasma concentration was 87.0 +/- 29.1 ng/ml. The Tmax was late (7.85 +/- 1.62 h), and part of individual pharmacokinetic profiles showed double peaks, which indicated scutellarin could be absorbed into the intestine after hydrolysis to its aglycone by bacterial enzymes. This was followed by reconjugation in the intestinal cell and/or liver with glucuronic acid catalyzed by the phase II enzyme, which showed regioselectivity and species difference. The regioselectivity of glucuronoconjugation for scutellarin may be of importance for pharmacological activity. Plasma concentration of isoscutellarin can be used as a biomarker of scutellarin intake.",1
"Purification of polar fractions from cacao liquor extracts gave 17 phenolics including four new compounds. The new compounds were characterized as a C-glycosidic flavan, an O-glycoside of a dimeric and two O-glycosides of trimeric A-linked proanthocyanidins, on the basis of spectroscopic data. Isolated polyphenols showed inhibitory effects on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent lipid peroxidation in microsomes and on the autoxidation of linoleic acid. These effects were attributed to the radical-scavenging activity in the peroxidation chain reactions, based on the findings that the cacao polyphenols effectively scavenged the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common disease in pediatric oncology. The history of developmental therapeutics for ALL began in the 1960s with the repetition of ""unreliable"" medical interventions against this lethal disease. By the 1990s, the development of multi-agent chemotherapy and various types of supportive care rendered ALL treatable. Highly sophisticated, molecular, diagnostic techniques have enabled highly accurate prediction of the relapse risk, and the application of risk-adapted treatments has increased the survival rate in the standard-risk group to nearly 100% in most European nations and North America. Incorporation of state-of-the-art, molecularly targeted agents and novel treatments, including cell and immunotherapy, is further improving outcomes even in the high-risk group. On the other hand, the financial burden of treating children with ALL has increased, imperiling the availability of these diagnostic and treatment strategies to patients in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The fundamental treatment strategy, consisting of corticosteroid and classical cytotoxic therapy, has achieved fairly good outcomes and should be feasible in LMICs as well. The present review will discuss the history of developmental therapeutics for childhood ALL in various countries through an extensive literature review with the aim of proposing a model for a treatment backbone for pediatric ALL. The discussion will hopefully benefit LMICs and be useful as a base for future clinical trials of novel treatments.",0
"End-to-End aspect-based sentiment analysis (E2E-ABSA) aims to jointly extract aspect terms and identify their sentiment polarities. Although previous research has demonstrated that syntax knowledge can be beneficial for E2E-ABSA, standard syntax dependency parsing struggles to capture the block-level relation between aspect and opinion terms, which hinders the role of syntax in E2E-ABSA. To address this issue, this paper proposes a block-level dependency syntax parsing (BDEP) based model to enhance the performance of E2E-ABSA. BDEP is constructed by incorporating routine dependency syntax parsing and part-of-speech tagging, which enables the capture of block-level relations. Subsequently. the BDEP-guided interactive attention module (BDEP-IAM) is used to obtain the aspect-aware representation of each word. Finally the adaptive fusion module is leveraged to combine the semantic-syntactic representation to simultaneously extract the aspect term and identify aspect-orient sentiment polarity. The model is evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including Laptop14, Rest _ALL, Restaurant14, Restaurant15, and TWITTER, with F1 scores of 62.67%, 76.53%, 75.42%, 62.21%, and 58.03%, respectively. The results show that our model outperforms the other compared state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all datasets. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the efficacy of BDEP and IAM in improving aspect-level sentiment analysis.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and bispecific T-cell engagers, which redirect T-cells to tumor antigens, have immensely benefitted patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell cancers. How these therapies differ in cardiotoxicity is underexplored. We used the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase, to compare cardiotoxicity profiles between CD19-targeted CAR-T therapy and blinatumomab (a CD19/CD3-targeted bispecific T-cell engager). Safety reports in VigiBase were filtered for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n = 17,479) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL, n = 28,803) for all adverse reactions. Data were further filtered for patients taking CAR-T therapy or blinatumomab. Reporting odds ratios (ROR) and fatality rates were compared between CAR-T cell products (e.g. tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel), and between CAR-T therapy and blinatumomab. Tisagenlecleucel is associated with cardiac failure (IC Tisagenlecleucel is associated with severe and fatal adverse cardiac events, with higher fatality rates for hypotension compared to axicabtagene ciloleucel in DLBCL patients, but similar hypotension fatality rates compared to blinatumomab in pediatric ALL patients. Effective management necessitates experienced physicians, including cardio-oncologists, skilled in interdisciplinary approaches to manage these toxicities. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and blinatumomab are two new types of cancer therapies used to treat blood cancers that fail to respond to conventional chemotherapy. Our goal is to study if there are major differences in how these treatments affect the heart. We analyzed a large, global database of patients who had these treatments. We find that in a blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, two CAR-T cell therapies are linked to heart failure and low blood pressure. In another type of cancer, acute lymphocytic leukemia, CAR-T cell therapy is associated with heart failure and cardiac arrest. The study suggests that given the frequency and severity of these side effects, clinical care should involve an interdisciplinary team experienced in managing these serious side effects.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer, with a significant global burden. This study evaluates global, regional, and national trends in the prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of childhood ALL from 1990 to 2021, providing insights into disparities and progress across different socio-demographic and geographic contexts. Data were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease study. Trends in prevalence, mortality, and DALYs were analyzed by socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, geographic areas, and countries. Estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were used to quantify temporal trends. Between 1990 and 2021, the global number of childhood ALL cases increased by 59.06%, reaching 168,879 cases in 2021, while ALL-related deaths and DALYs decreased by 66.71% and 66.13%, respectively. High- and high-middle SDI regions demonstrated significant improvements, driven by advances in healthcare and early diagnosis. In contrast, low-SDI regions faced persistent challenges, with a slight increase in DALYs observed in 2021. Geographic disparities were pronounced, with East Asia achieving the largest reductions in mortality and DALYs, whereas Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean remained heavily burdened. Despite progress in reducing mortality and DALYs globally, the rising prevalence of ALL and persistent disparities in low-SDI regions highlight the urgent need for equitable access to healthcare, early diagnosis, and effective treatment strategies. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure and fostering global collaboration are critical to further mitigating the burden of childhood ALL and ensuring equitable outcomes worldwide.",0
"The olive fruit intended for oil extraction was inoculated by Lactobacillus plantarum to evaluate the anti-oxidative effect. Results showed that orthodiphenols, in particular dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (Hy-EDA) increased their concentration in oils issued from the olive fruits inoculated by Lactobacillus. Among non-orthodiphenols, the tyrosol increased their concentration. Oil quality issued from inoculated olive fruits had a higher quality. The difference between the acidity, K232 and K270 indices and sensory quality shows clearly the positive effect of Lactobacillus on olive oil quality. Beside, aqueous phase showed a higher concentration of phenolics when the olive fruits were inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum. Storage of the aqueous phase showed that phenolic compounds concentration has decreased.",1
"A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly simplified. The method was applied to the comparison of stabilized and unstabilized lagers, and to the analysis of different barley varieties grown in Ireland.",1
"The antioxidant activities and total phenolics of 28 plant products, including sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, wheat germ, buckwheat, and several fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants were determined. The total phenolic content, determined according to the Folin−Ciocalteu method, varied from 169 to 10548 mg/100 g of dry product. Antioxidant activity of methanolic extract evaluated according to the β-carotene bleaching method expressed as AOX (Δ log A470/min), AA (percent inhibition relative to control), ORR (oxidation rate ratio), and AAC (antioxidant activity coefficient) ranged from 0.05, 53.7, 0.009, and 51.7 to 0.26, 99.1, 0.46, and 969.3, respectively. The correlation coefficient between total phenolics and antioxidative activities was statistically significant.",1
"The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin (EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the antioxidative activity of plasma.",1

"B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common malignancy of childhood. With the introduction of novel cellular therapies, cost of care is a critical component and the financial burden experienced by patients and society requires evaluation. This study aims to assess the utilization and cost of care for chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy for pediatric ALL patients with commercial insurance coverage in the United States. Using de-identified commercial insurance data from the OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, a cohort of 37 patients, aged 1-25 years, with B-ALL treated with CAR-T therapy between Oct 2016 and Dec 2021 in the United States was identified. Cost was evaluated for a 90 day period encompassing CAR-T infusion and by administration and complication characteristics. Among the 37 identified B-ALL patients that received a CAR-T product infusion, 14 patients were female, median age at administration was 13 years. The median 90-day total cost was $620,500 (Mean: $589,108). Inpatient cost accounted for approximately 71% of the total cost with an average of 28 inpatient days per patient. Although inpatient cost was slightly higher in the older age group (aged 10-25 years) and in patients with a code for cytokine release syndrome (CRS), these differences were not statistically significant. This real-world cost analysis shows for the first time the encompassing cost of CAR-T therapy for pediatric B-ALL patients in the US with commercial insurance. This study provides a valuable benchmark that can be used to analyze the financial implications of CAR-T therapy for pediatric B-ALL therapy on health systems.",0
Sensitive methods for the determination of ferulic acid and 4-vinyl guaiacol in beers and worts are described. Samples were analyzed by direct-injection high-performance liquid chromatography using an octadecyl silica column. Detection was by either fluorescence monitoring (for 4-vinyl guaiacol alone) or electrochemical detection (for simultaneous determination of ferulic acid and 4-vinyl guaiacol). The methods were applied mainly to the analysis of production beers but were used also to monitor the decarboxylation of ferulic acid to 4-vinyl guaiacol in wort during a small-scale fermentation deliberately contaminated with a wild yeast strain.,1
"CD10, CD19 and MPO in one flow cytometry tube facilitated distinguishing B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with dim expression of MPO versus B/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemia. B-ALL chemotherapy followed by blinatumomab bridging to allogeneic stem cell transplantation was successful in our patient.",0
"The effect of microwave, boiling and pressure cooking on total antioxidant capacity and total phenolics content of seven vegetables were studied. Total phenolics in raw and cooked vegetables were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu method, whereas the total antioxidant capacity of vegetables extracts was evaluated using the Crocin method. After boiling, four out of seven vegetables (cauliflower, peas, spinach and Swiss chard) showed a significant decrease in their total phenolic content (P < 0.05). No decrease or a smaller decrease was observed for these four vegetables (P < 0.05) after pressure cooking and/or microwaving than after boiling. The total antioxidant capacity of potato and Swiss chard was not significantly affected by cooking procedures, whereas it decreased for spinach and peas, and it increased for tomato and carrots (P < 0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant correlation between total phenolic content and total antioxidant capacity in cooked and uncooked vegetables, but the strength of the correlation increased when separating carotenoid-poor from carotenoid-rich vegetables.",1
"The anthocyanins and colorless phenolics in 11 cultivars and hybrids of sweet cherries were characterized and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. All of the dark-colored cherry genotypes were found to contain 3-rutinoside and 3-glucoside of cyanidin as the major anthocyanins and the same glycosides of peonidin as minor anthocyanins. Another minor anthocyanin, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, was characterized in sweet cherries for the first time. The major colorless phenolics were characterized as neochlorogenic acid and p-coumaroylquinic acid. The total anthocyanin content ranged from 82 to 297 mg/100 g of pitted cherry for the dark cherries and from 2 to 41 mg/100 g of pitted fruit for the light-colored cherries. The neochlorogenic acid ranged from 24 to 128 mg/100 g of pitted cherry and p-coumaroylquinic acid from 23 to 131 mg/100 g, respectively. The relative amounts of the two phenolic acids varied widely across the cherry cultivars examined in this study.",1
"Many in vitro studies demonstrated significant biological effects of trans-resveratrol. Thus, understanding the rate of intestinal absorption and metabolization in vivo of trans-resveratrol is the prerequisite to evaluate its potential health impact. Bioavailability studies mainly in animals or in humans using the pure compound at very high doses were performed. In this work, trans-resveratrol bioavailability from a moderate consumption of red wine in 25 healthy humans has been studied by three different experiments. The wine ingestion was associated to three different dietary approaches: fasting, a standard meal, a meal with high and low amount of lipids. Trans-resveratrol 3- and 4'-glucuronides were synthesized, purified, and characterized as pure standards. Bioavailability data were obtained by measuring the concentration of free, 3-glucuronide and 4'-glucuronide trans-resveratrol by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), both with ultraviolet (UV) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection, in serum samples taken at different times after red wine administration. Free trans-resveratrol was found, in trace amounts, only in some serum samples collected 30 min after red wine ingestion while after longer times resveratrol glucuronides predominated. Trans-resveratrol bioavailability was shown to be independent from the meal or its lipid content. The finding in human serum of trans-resveratrol glucuronides, rather than the free form of the compound, with a high interindividual variability, raises some doubts about the health effects of dietary resveratrol consumption and suggests that the benefits associated to red wine consumption could be probably due to the whole antioxidant pool present in red wine.",1
"The purpose of this study was to investigate biomarkers of the bioavailability and metabolism of hydroxycinnamate derivatives through the determination of the pharmacokinetics of their urinary elimination and identification of the metabolites excreted. Coffee was used as a rich source of caffeic acid derivatives and human supplementation was undertaken. The results show a highly significant increase in the excretion of ferulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic acid (3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid), and vanillic acid postsupplementation relative to the levels presupplementation. Thus, ferulic, isoferulic, and dihydroferulic acids are specific biomarkers for the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary caffeic acid esters. Isoferulic acid is a unique biomarker as it is not a dietary component, however, dihydroferulic acid may well derive from other flavonoids with a structurally related B-ring. 3-Hydroxyhippuric acid has also been identified as an indicator for bioavailability and metabolism of phenolic compounds, and shows a highly significant excretion increase postsupplementation. The results reveal isoferulic acid (and possibly dihydroferulic acid) as novel markers of caffeoyl quinic acid metabolism.",1
"Twelve cultivars of different colored onions (white, golden, and red) were evaluated for fresh bulb yields and for flavonoid contents. The fresh bulb yields ranged from 3.1 to 6.7 kg m−2 as found in golden cultivars “Santana” and “Castillo” respectively. The flavonoids, extracted with methanol/water/acetic acid (50:42:8, v:v:v) from fresh bulbs and characterized by HPLC with a DAD detector, were mainly made up of quercetin and isorhamnetin in the form of aglycones and glycosides. The highest amount of free quercetin was detected in the fresh bulbs of “Tropea rossa tonda” (557.8 mgkg−1) whereas that of total flavonoids was found in “Dorata Density” (979.1 mgkg−1). The golden cultivar “Castillo” resulted in the highest bulb and flavonoid yields (6.7 kg m−2 and 5.2 g m−2 respectively)",1

"Distinguishing T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/T-LBL) from thymomas (especially B1 or B2 type) can be challenging particularly in limited trucut biopsy material where appreciating architecture is difficult or the background epithelial component does not provide tangible evidence for definite diagnosis. As a pathologist, it is important to accurately diagnose these neoplasms because they have entirely distinct management protocols. Recent studies have reported that LIM Domain Only 2 (LMO2) is expressed in neoplastic lymphoblasts of T-ALL/T-LBL and is absent in thymocytes of normal thymuses or thymomas. An observational study was done to test the sensitivity and specificity of LMO2 in differentiating neoplastic lymphoblasts from thymocytes of thymomas/normal thymuses. Our study showed that LMO2 had sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 100% in diagnosing LBL. None of the thymomas (B1 or B2 type) showed expression of LMO2 in the neoplastic cells. LMO2 is a reliable marker of transformed T-cell precursors and should be routinely included in immunohistochemical panel when evaluating thymic/mediastinal neoplasms.",0
"Antioxidant activity of the phenolic fraction of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was measured by means of a chemical and an electrochemical method. Both methods were tested in predicting the oxidative spoilage and stability to oxidation of 22 EVOO samples and resulted correlated with peroxide values and oxidative stability measured by Rancimat. The main phenolic compounds of EVOOs were detected by HRGC. To study the contribution of single polyphenols (PPs) to antioxidant activity of phenolic fraction and oxidative stability of EVOOs, multivariate statistical analyses were applied on HRGC data. An isomer of oleuropein aglycon was shown to affect significantly antioxidant activity of phenolic fraction but not oil stability to oxidation. No individual compounds was identified as the main cause of the overall antioxidant activity, and the total polyphenol determination by the Folin reagent was better correlated to antioxidant activity and oxidative stability than each tested PP or PPs groups such as o-diphenols.",1
"The bone marrow microenvironment plays a critical role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) progression, yet its cellular heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on patient-derived bone marrow aspirates from pediatric B-ALL patients, we identified two distinct mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) populations: early mesenchymal progenitors and adipogenic progenitors. Spatial transcriptomic analysis further revealed the localization of these cell types and identified a third stromal population, osteogenic-lineage cells, exclusively present in the bone biopsy. Functional ex vivo assays using sorted stromal populations derived from B-ALL patient bone marrow aspirates demonstrated that both early mesenchymal and adipogenic progenitors secrete key niche-supportive factors, including CXCL12 and Osteopontin, and support leukemic cell survival and chemoresistance. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that B-ALL cells interact differently with stromal subtypes. Notably, adipogenic progenitors, but not early mesenchymal progenitors, provide support to leukemic cells through interleukin-7 and VCAM1 signaling. Stromal cells from B-ALL patients exhibited an enhanced adipogenic differentiation capacity compared to healthy controls. Moreover, co-culture experiments showed that B-ALL cells induce adipogenic differentiation in healthy MSCs through a cell contact-dependent mechanism. Adipogenic progenitors were also enriched in relapse samples, implicating them in disease progression. These findings highlight the complexity of the B-ALL microenvironment and identify different specialized stromal niches with which the leukemic cells can engage.",0
"Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo actions.",1
"Commercially available curcumin, a bright orange-yellow color pigment of turmeric, consists of a mixture of three curcuminoids, namely, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. These were isolated by column chromatography and identified by spectroscopic studies. The purity of the curcuminoids was analyzed by an improved HPLC method. HPLC separation was performed on a C(18) column using three solvents, methanol, 2% AcOH, and acetonitrile, with detection at 425 nm. Four different commercially available varieties of turmeric, namely, Salem, Erode, Balasore, and local market samples, were analyzed to detect the percentage of these three curcuminoids. The percentages of curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin as estimated using their calibration curves were found to be 1.06 +/- 0.061 to 5.65 +/- 0.040, 0.83 +/- 0.047 to 3.36 +/- 0.040, and 0.42 +/- 0.036 to 2.16 +/- 0.06, respectively, in four different samples. The total percentages of curcuminoids are 2.34 +/- 0.171 to 9.18 +/- 0.232%.",1
"This study was designed to determine the composition in hydroxycinnamic acids and the antioxidant properties of soluble extracts from wheat, rye and buckwheat. Free, soluble and insoluble hydroxycinnamic acids were determined by HPLC-diode array (DAD). Some C-glycosyl flavonoid derivatives were also identified by LC/MS/MS. Total antioxidant capacity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and scavenging of oxygen radicals were used to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity of the cereal soluble extracts. The highest levels of total hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives were found in the wheat bran and rye bran fractions whereas the buckwheat flours had only trace quantities of these compounds. The most abundant compound present in the wheat and rye fractions was ferulic acid but small quantities of diferulic acids, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid and benzoic acid derivatives were also present. The largest proportions of these phenolic compounds were found covalently bound (esters) in the insoluble pellet but between 10% and 30% of the total compounds were solubilized, mostly in water. Most of the antioxidant capacity was found in the water extracts from all the cereal fractions. Overall, buckwheat and wheat germ products exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity whereas the rye products had the lowest antioxidant values. The antioxidant capacity of these complex cereal extracts cannot be explained by simple correlation with the content of total soluble hydroxycinnamic acids. All other soluble compounds present in the extracts, their possible antioxidant activity and interactions need to be elucidated in order to fully explain the final antioxidant capacity of the extracts.",1
"Impaired linear growth is an important morbidity in childhood cancer survivors (CCS); however, chemotherapy-associated factors that affect height outcomes remain elusive. Accordingly, we conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study that included survivors of childhood-onset acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed between 2002 and 2021 who achieved complete remission through chemotherapy alone. Anthropometric parameters and treatment protocols were evaluated based on medical records. Individuals with background disorders or impaired growth were excluded from the study. Associations between anthropometric parameters during chemotherapy and height standard deviation scores (height-SDS) at the current visit were investigated. The results are expressed as the median (interquartile range). Seventy-three individuals (males, N = 44) were included in the study. The median age (years) at diagnosis, end of chemotherapy, and current visit were 4.2 (3.2 to 7.9), 6.3 (5.1 to 10.0), and 15.9 (11.4 to 19.2), respectively. Height-SDS at diagnosis was -0.25 (-0.65 to 0.35), which significantly declined during chemotherapy and recovered thereafter, resulting in a current height-SDS of -0.31 (-0.84 to 0.22). The height-SDS at the investigated time points and its changes during chemotherapy did not differ among the treatment protocols. Multivariate analysis revealed that height-SDS at the current visit was positively associated with changes in body mass index (BMI)-SDS during chemotherapy (β = 0.22, p = 0.01) after adjusting for sex, current age, height-SDS at diagnosis, changes in height-SDS during chemotherapy, and treatment protocols. Since changes in BMI are potentially influenced by nutritional status, our results may underscore the importance of nutritional status during chemotherapy on height outcomes in childhood ALL survivors.",0
"To evaluate seasonal variations in antioxidant components of greenhouse cherry tomatoes, the compositional profile of fruits (“Pomodoro di Pachino”, cv. Naomi F1) harvested at six different times of the year was compared. Among tomato antioxidants, phenolic compounds (naringenin content ranged from 1.84 to 9.04mg/100g, rutin from 1.79 to 6.61mg/100g) and α-tocopherol (40–1160μg/100g) showed the greatest variability. Ascorbic acid (31–71mg/100g), carotenoids (8350–15119μg/100g), phenolics and α-tocopherol concentration did not show definite seasonal trends, nor correlation with solar radiation or average temperature. Nevertheless, tomatoes harvested in mid-summer were characterized by lowered lycopene levels. Greenhouse growing conditions induced the accumulation of relatively high level of antioxidants for most of the year: one serving of raw tomatoes (100g) could provide from 50% to 120% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C, from 13% to 27% of that of vitamin A, from 0.4% to 12% of that of vitamin E, and from 15% to 35% of the flavonoid daily intake estimated for an Italian diet.",1
"Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed development.",1
"The health effects of consumption of isoflavones from soy products are being actively investigated, yet food composition tables often have incomplete values for commercial foods containing soy additives. Therefore, we analyzed 167 processed and fast foods with soy additives (e.g. isolated soy protein, soy protein concentrate, soy flour, and hydrolyzed soy protein) for the isoflavones daidzein, glycitein, and genistein. Total isoflavones were computed by adding these three isoflavones. Additionally, 12 traditional soybean products were analyzed, including soy flour and Asian condiments made from soybeans. Foods were sampled from food stores and fast-food restaurants in Hawaii. Concentrations of total isoflavones, expressed as aglycones, ranged from not detected (ND, for 49 foods) to 149.9mg/100g. Ranges within food groups were: bread and grain products (ND—93.9), gravies and sauces (ND—2.7), meat and poultry products (ND—15.9), meat substitutes (0.3–149.9), nutritional products (0.4–36.5), reduced fat peanut butters (0.1–4.0), seafood products (ND—1.6), and soybean products (2.9–109.3). For 56 foods on our food composition table, we calculated composite isoflavone values reflecting the mean of multiple brands and the proportion of brands containing soy additives. The resulting table now permits more accurate estimates of total isoflavone intakes by participants in our research studies.",1
"It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate cancers are greater than the Japanese.",1
"The transcription factor (TF) Ikaros zinc finger 1 (IKZF1) is essential for B-cell development, and recurrently mutated in human B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). IKZF1 has been ascribed both activating and repressive functions via interactions with coactivator and corepressor complexes, but the relative abundance of IKZF1-associated coregulators and their contribution to IKZF1-mediated gene regulation are not well understood. To address this, we performed an unbiased identification of IKZF1-interacting proteins in pre-B cells and found that IKZF1 interacts overwhelmingly with corepressors and heterochromatin-associated proteins. Time-resolved analysis of transcription and chromatin state identified transcriptional repression as the immediate response to IKZF1 induction. Transcriptional repression preceded transcriptional activation by several hours, manifesting as a decrease in the fraction of transcriptional bursts at the single-molecule level. Repression was accompanied by a rapid loss of chromatin accessibility and reduced levels of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), particularly at enhancers. We identified highly conserved helical motifs within the intrinsically disordered region of IKZF1 that mediate its association with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) corepressor complex through critical ""KRK"" residues that bind the NuRD subunit retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4), a mechanism shared with the TFs FOG1, BCL11A, and SALL4. Functional characterization reveals that this region is necessary for the efficient silencing of target genes and antiproliferative functions of IKZF1 in B-ALL.",0
"Two studies, one with four cultivars grown at four locations during 1989 to 1993, and the second with a transgenic and its non-transformed parent cultivar grown at three locations for three years, were undertaken to explore the variation in total flavonoid content of flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum). Results of the analyses of variance for the first study showed significant cultivar as well as environmental effect on flavonoid content. Cultivar NorLin displayed the highest flavonoid content across the sites with a mean of 71 mg/100 g, and Omega, a yellow-seeded flaxseed cultivar, the lowest with a mean of 35 mg/100 g. There was no significant difference between a transgenic flaxseed and its non-transformed parent for total flavonoid content except for one location in 1991. Flavonoid content was inversely related to the protein content and there was a weak positive correlation between flavonoid and oil levels.",1
"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in illness, deaths and societal disruption on a global scale. Societies have implemented various control measures to reduce transmission of the virus and mitigate its impact. Individual behavioural changes are crucial to the successful implementation of these measures. One commonly recommended measure to limit risk of infection is face covering. It is important to identify those factors that can predict the uptake and maintenance of face covering. We aimed to identify and synthesise the evidence on malleable psychological and psychosocial factors that determine uptake and adherence to face covering aimed at reducing the risk of infection or transmission of COVID-19. We searched various literature sources including electronic databases (Medline ALL, Child Development & Adolescent Studies, ERIC, PsycInfo, CINAHL & Web of Science), web searches, conference proceedings, government reports, other repositories of literature and grey literature. The search strategy was built around three concepts of interest including (1) context (terms relating to COVID19), (2) behaviour of interest and (3) terms related to psychological and psychosocial determinants of COVID Health-Related Behaviours and adherence or compliance with face covering, to capture malleable determines. Searches capture studies up until October 2021. Eligibility criteria included observational studies (both retrospective and prospective) and experimental studies that measure and report malleable psychological and psychosocial determinants and handwashing at an individual level, amongst the general public. Screening was supported by the Cochrane Crowd. Studies titles and abstracts were screened against the eligibility criteria by three independent screeners. Following this, all potentially relevant studies were screened at full-text level by the research team. All conflicts between screeners were resolved by discussion between the core research team. All data extraction was managed in EPPI-Reviewer software. All eligible studies, identified through full-text screening were extracted by one author. We extracted data on study information, population, determinant, behaviour and effects. A second author checked data extraction on 20% of all included papers. All conflicts were discussed by the two authors until consensus was reached. We assessed methodological quality of all included studies using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Quality appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies. Our initial searches yielded 23,587 results, of which 23 were included in this review. The included studies were cross-sectional in design, came from nine countries and had a combined sample of 54,401 participants. The vast majority of studies had samples from the general public, with five of the studies focusing on specific samples. All included studies considered people over the age of 18. The quality of 10 of the studies was rated as unclear, 10 were rated as low, and 3 rated high risk of bias, predominately due to lack of reporting of recruitment, sample characteristics and methodology. Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis and 16 in the narrative synthesis. Findings from the meta-analysis indicated that knowledge of COVID-19 (0.341, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06, 0.530, Understanding the effects of various malleable determinants on COVID-related face covering can aid in the development and implementation of interventions and public health campaigns to promote face covering behaviour in potential new waves of COVID-19 or other respiratory infections. Knowledge of COVID and perceived benefits of face coverings warrant further consideration in future research and policy.",0
"Consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, especially phenolics, in fruits and vegetables are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds for the health benefits. However, the phenolic contents and their antioxidant activities in fruits and vegetables were underestimated in the literature, because bound phenolics were not included. This study was designed to investigate the profiles of total phenolics, including both soluble free and bound forms in common fruits, by applying solvent extraction, base digestion, and solid-phase extraction methods. Cranberry had the highest total phenolic content, followed by apple, red grape, strawberry, pineapple, banana, peach, lemon, orange, pear, and grapefruit. Total antioxidant activity was measured using the TOSC assay. Cranberry had the highest total antioxidant activity (177.0 +/- 4.3 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of fruit), followed by apple, red grape, strawberry, peach, lemon, pear, banana, orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. Antiproliferation activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human liver-cancer cells, and cranberry showed the highest inhibitory effect with an EC(50) of 14.5 +/- 0.5 mg/mL, followed by lemon, apple, strawberry, red grape, banana, grapefruit, and peach. A bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a new alternative biomarker for future epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.",1
"Rapidly progressing ALL, a potentially fatal disease, demands timely diagnosis and treatment. On the other hand, spontaneous remission/regression (SR) is reported in various cancers including aggressive tumors like ALL. Infection or trauma-mediated immune system activation is assumed to cause SR, with the duration in cases of ALL typically being short. Indolent T-lymphoblastic proliferation (i-TLP) exhibits the uniform proliferation of TdT-positive T-cells, despite being a non-neoplastic disease, underscoring the significance of distinguishing it from T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). i-TLP is expected to gain wider recognition and further advancements in understanding its pathology. Here, we present the case of a 59-year-old woman with T-ALL characterized by cycles of progression and SR followed by a rapid blast proliferation. This is the first reported case of T-ALL with repeated SR for more than one year, making this case an extremely rare clinical presentation. This challenging case will enhance comprehension of T-cell tumor pathogenesis.",0
"We have clarified for the first time how cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (C3G), which is a potent antioxidant anthocyanin, is absorbed and metabolized in vivo. Rats were orally administered C3G (0.9 mmol/kg body weight), and C3G rapidly appeared in the plasma. However, the aglycon of C3G (cyanidin; Cy) was not detected, although it was present in the jejunum. Protocatechuic acid (PC), which may be produced by degradation of Cy, was present in the plasma and the concentration was 8-fold higher than that of C3G. These results suggest that plasma PC and C3G may contribute to the antioxidant activity of the plasma. In the liver and kidney, C3G was metabolized to methylated C3G (methyl-C3G), suggesting that C3G and/or methyl-C3G act as antioxidants in the tissues.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) is a rare hematologic malignancy most commonly affecting adolescent and young adult males. Outcomes are dismal for patients who relapse, thus, improvement in treatment is needed. Nelarabine, a prodrug of the deoxyguanosine analog 9-β-arabinofuranosylguanine, is uniquely toxic to T lymphoblasts, compared with B lymphoblasts and normal lymphocytes, and has been developed for the treatment of T-ALL/LBL. Based on phase 1 and 2 trials in children and adults, single-agent nelarabine is approved for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/LBL, with the major adverse effect being central and peripheral neurotoxicity. Since its approval in 2005, nelarabine has been studied in combination with other chemotherapy agents for relapsed disease and is also being studied as a component of initial treatment in pediatric and adult patients. Here, we review current data on nelarabine and present our approach to the use of nelarabine in the treatment of patients with T-ALL/LBL.",0
"Simple and acylated anthocyanins and other phenolics in ten cultivars and hybrids of lowbush and one cultivar of highbush blueberries were extracted, isolated and quantified by reversed phase HPLC and capillary gas liquid chromatography. All cultivars contained nonacylated glucosides and galactosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin. Each anthocyanin also occurred in the acetylated form in eight of eleven cultivars. Total anthocyanins in blueberries ranged from 110 to 260 mg/100g of fresh berries. ‘Blomidon’ berries contained the lowest and ‘Chignecto’ berries the highest level. Acetylated anthocyanins made up to 35% of the total anthocyanins in ‘Chignecto’. Chlorogenic acid was the major colorless phenolic of lowbush and highbush blueberries, at 50–100 mg/100 g fresh fruit.",1
"Vincristine (VCR) is a vital component in numerous treatment regimens for pediatric blood cancer. VCR-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN) represents a type of VCR toxicity influenced by multiple factors, including age, race, genetic traits, dosage, interactions, and administration regimen. However, the dose-response relationship of VIPN remains elusive. VCR is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3 A to generate the major metabolite M1. To date, there is a lack of literature documenting the pharmacokinetics (PK) characteristics of VCR and M1 in Chinese children within a 96 h timeframe. To address the gap, a developed LC-MS/MS method was successfully employed in the PK study of VCR and M1 in Chinese pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. M1 was obtained through in vitro metabolism experiments, and mixed plasma samples of M1 and VCR were prepared. Plasma samples were pre-processed using the solid-phase extraction (SPE) technique. Samples were loaded into ProElut C18 Cartridges, washed with 5% methanol aqueous solution, and eluted with methanol. The eluent was concentrated and reconstituted for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The standard calibration curves for VCR and M1 were 0.1-50 ng/mL and 0.05-5 ng/mL, respectively, with linear coefficients exceeding 0.99. Accuracy and precision of quality control (QC) samples fell within 115%. The analytical approach satisfied the quantitative demands for VCR and M1 in plasma samples within 96 h. VCR was metabolized to M1 at a relatively constant proportion (5.37%-18.06%) of VCR in vivo. No significant differences were observed in PK parameters of VCR in Chinese children compared to other countries and races. Further investigation is required to identify the key factors influencing VIPN in Chinese children.",0
"The influence of four day/night growing temperature combinations (18/12, 25/12, 25/22, and 30/22 degrees C) on phenolic acid, flavonol, and anthocyanin content and their antioxidant activities against peroxyl radicals (ROO(*)), superoxide radicals (O(2)(*)(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), hydroxyl radicals (OH(*)), and singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) in fruit juice of Earliglow and Kent strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) cultivars was studied. Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside (291.3-945.1 microg/g fresh wt.), pelargonidin 3-rutinoside (24.7-50.9 microg/g fresh wt.), and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate (62.2-244.0 microg/g fresh wt.) were the predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit juice. The content of cyanidin-based anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins. Strawberry growth in high temperature conditions significantly enhanced the content of p-coumaroylglucose, dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate in strawberry juice. Plants grown in the cool day and cool night temperature (18/12 degrees C) generally had the lowest phenolic acid, flavonols, and anthocyanins. An increase in night temperature from 12 to 22 degrees C, with the day temperature kept constant at 25 degrees C, resulted in a significant increase in phenolic acid, flavonols, and anthocyanins. These conditions also resulted in a significant increase in antioxidant capacity. The highest day/night temperature (30/22 degrees C) yielded fruit with the most phenolic content as well as ROO(*), O(2)(*)(-), H(2)O(2), OH(*), and (1)O(2) radical absorbance capacity. Fruit of Kent cv. strawberry had higher values of phenolic acid, flavonols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacities than fruit of Earliglow cv. strawberry under all temperature regimes.",1
"The chemical composition of virgin olive oils from Arbequina olives cultivated in Córdoba (Argentina) was studied in relation to the oil extraction system and production year. Significant variations were found between oils obtained by pressure (PEOs) and centrifugation (CEOs) systems. PEOs were characterised by higher values of acidity, pigments and oleic acid, while CEOs showed greater phenol content. Moreover, a significant effect of crop year was observed. Arbequina oils produced in Córdoba contained lower amounts of oleic acid but higher amounts of phenolic compounds than Arbequina oils produced in Spain. A storage stability test was carried out in order to study the combined effects of oil extraction system and storage conditions (packaging material and illumination) on quality indices related to oxidative stability. Multivariate analysis applied to the chemical data emphasised the differences between PEOs and CEOs, indicating that variations due to extraction system were greater than those due to illumination condition and package type. Cluster analysis of oils from each extraction system stressed the influence of illumination condition on the oxidative stability of olive oils, showing increased amounts of secondary oxidation products in oils exposed to light. Glass and tin packages appear to be the most appropriate containers for maintaining the quality of olive oils, but this supposition is strongly dependent on the type of oil (PEO or CEO) and its initial chemical properties",1
"The free and bound phenols have been measured in 20 fruits commonly consumed in the American diet. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with catechin as the standard after correction for ascorbic acid contribution. On a fresh weight basis, cranberry had the highest total phenols, and was distantly followed by red grape. Free and total phenol quality in the fruits was analyzed by using the inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation promoted by cupric ion. Ascorbate had only a minor contribution to the antioxidants in fruits with the exception of melon, nectarine, orange, white grape, and strawberry. The fruit extracts' antioxidant quality was better than the vitamin antioxidants and most pure phenols, suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. Using our assay, fruits had significantly better quantity and quality of phenol antioxidants than vegetables. Fruits, specifically apples and cranberries, have phenol antioxidants that can enrich lower density lipoproteins and protect them from oxidation. The average per capita consumption of fruit phenols in the U.S. is estimated to be 255 mg/day of catechin equivalents.",1
"The nonsteroidal estrogen equol occurs as diastereoisomers, S-(-)equol and R-(+)equol, both of which have significant biological actions. S-(-)equol, the naturally occurring enantiomer produced by 20-30% of adults consuming soy foods, has selective affinity for estrogen receptor-beta, whereas both enantiomers modulate androgen action. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of the diastereoisomers, despite current interest in developing equol as a nutraceutical or pharmaceutical agent.",1
"Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble chalcones.",1
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare disease that causes progressive muscle degeneration resulting in life-threatening cardiac complications. The objective of this systematic literature review was to describe and grade the published evidence of predictors of cardiac disease in DMD. The review encompassed searches of Embase, MEDLINE ALL, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2022, for predictors of cardiac disease in DMD. The certainty of evidence (i.e., very low to high) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. We included 33 publications encompassing 9,232 patients with DMD. We found moderate- to high-quality evidence that cardiac medication (i.e., ACE inhibitors [enalapril and perindopril], β-blockers [carvedilol], and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists [eplerenone]) are significantly associated with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), and left ventricular circumferential strain (LVCS). DMD mutations in exons 51 and 52 were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of cardiomyopathy; deletions treatable by exon 53 skipping and mutations in the Dp116 coding region with improved LVEF and prolonged cardiac dysfunction-free survival; and exons 45-50 and 52 with early left ventricular systolic dysfunction (low/very low-quality evidence). We found high-quality evidence that glucocorticoids (deflazacort) are significantly associated with preserved LVEF and improved fractional shortening (FS), and low-quality evidence that glucocorticoids (deflazacort, prednisone, and/or prednisolone) are associated with improved ejection fraction (EF) and lower risk of cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure-related mortality. Full-time mechanical ventilation was found to be significantly correlated with LVEF (low-quality evidence), muscle strength with FS (low-quality evidence), and genetic modifiers (i.e., LTBP4 rs10880 and ACTN3) with LVEF, lower risk of cardiomyopathy and left ventricular dilation (low-quality evidence). Several sources of cardiac disease heterogeneity are well-studied in patients with DMD. Yet, the certainty of evidence is generally low, and little is known of the contribution of non-pharmacological interventions, as well as the impact of different criteria for initiation of specific treatments. Our findings help raise awareness of prevailing unmet needs, shape expectations of treatment outcomes, and inform the design of future research.",0
"AUTO1 is a fast off-rate CD19-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which has been successfully tested in adult lymphoblastic leukemia. Tscm/Tcm-enriched CAR-T populations confer the best expansion and persistence, but Tscm/Tcm numbers are poor in heavily pretreated adult patients. To improve this, we evaluate the use of AKT inhibitor (VIII) with the aim of uncoupling T-cell expansion from differentiation, to enrich Tscm/Tcm subsets. VIII was incorporated into the AUTO1 manufacturing process based on the semiautomated the CliniMACS Prodigy platform at both small and cGMP scale. AUTO1 manufactured with VIII showed Tscm/Tcm enrichment, improved expansion and cytotoxicity in vitro and superior antitumor activity in vivo. Further, VIII induced AUTO1 Th1/Th17 skewing, increased polyfunctionality, and conferred a unique metabolic profile and a novel signature for autophagy to support enhanced expansion and cytotoxicity. We show that VIII-cultured AUTO1 products from B-ALL patients on the ALLCAR19 study possess superior phenotype, metabolism, and function than parallel control products and that VIII-based manufacture is scalable to cGMP. Ultimately, AUTO1 generated with VIII may begin to overcome the product specific factors contributing to CD19+relapse.",0
"Cyclin D2 (CCND2) is a crucial player in cell cycle regulation. CCND2 polymorphisms contribute to cancer predisposition. To evaluate the association of CCND2 rs3217927 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and its expression levels with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility in Egyptian children and its potential prognostic role. The 5' nuclease allelic discrimination assay was used to evaluate the frequency of CCND2 rs3217927 SNP in 80 newly diagnosed children with ALL and 80 age- and sex-matched controls. CCND2 relative expression levels were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The genotype analysis revealed that the GG genotype and G allele were significantly more prevalent among ALL patients than controls (p ˂ .001). Regression analysis demonstrated that Egyptian children carrying only one G allele had about 31-fold increased risk to develop ALL compared to A allele carriers. CCND2 was overexpressed in ALL patients compared to controls (p < .001). The CCND2 overexpression was associated with the GG genotype and G allele (p < .001). Furthermore, G allele was an independent negative prognostic marker for central nervous system (CNS) involvement (odds ratio [OR] = 4.676; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-18.6), risk stratification (OR = 38; 95% CI: 7.7-188.2), and chemoresistance (OR = 9.864; 95% CI: 5.6-70.3) in ALL patients. G allele of CCND2 rs3217927 SNP might be associated with increased risk for ALL in Egyptian children besides being an independent negative prognostic marker for their risk stratification and therapeutic outcome. CCND2 rs3217927 SNP genotyping might be used to demarcate ALL patients with aggressive disease phenotypes who may be candidate for alternative targeted therapeutic strategies.",0
"Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of anthocyanins to various organs (bladder, prostate, testes, heart and adipose tissue) in rats fed with a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 days. Identification and quantification of anthocyanins were carried out by HPLC-DAD. The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins (native anthocyanins and their metabolites) was low (0.20 +/- 0.03%, n = 8). Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives (methylated anthocyanins and glucurono-conjugated derivatives) differed according to the organ considered. The bladder contained the highest levels of anthocyanins followed by the prostate. Prostate, testes and heart contained native cyanidin 3-glucoside and a small proportion of cyanidin monoglucuronide. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and methylated derivatives were present in adipose tissue. Thus, anthocyanin feeding in rats resulted in a wide distribution of anthocyanin derivatives to several organs. Identification of target tissues of anthocyanins may then help to understand the mechanisms of action of anthocyanins in vivo.",1
"The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L (average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types of wines.",1
"Ten Mauritian vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower, white cabbage, lettuce, Chinese cabbage, mugwort, carrot, onion, tomato and chilli pepper, were analysed for their total phenol, flavonoid, proanthocyanidin and vitamin C contents and antioxidant capacity. Antioxidant activities of the vegetables ranged from 0.43 to 3.68 µmol g−1 fresh weight Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and from 0.60 to 8.47 µmol g−1 fresh weight ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Levels of total phenols in the vegetables varied between 132 and 1189 µg g−1 fresh weight and those of total flavonoids between 45 and 944 µg g−1 fresh weight, while proanthocyanidins were detected at very low levels in only a few vegetables. Vitamin C contents varied between 25 and 748 µg g−1 fresh weight. Quercetin was the dominant flavonoid aglycone in the hydrolysed vegetable extracts, with values in the range of 15–390 µg g−1 fresh weight. There were strong correlations between antioxidant capacity and total phenols (TEAC, r = 0.91; FRAP, r = 0.83) and total flavonoids (TEAC, r = 0.89; FRAP, r = 0.82). Vitamin C contents showed poor correlation with TEAC values (r = 0.33), while no correlation was observed with FRAP values. Highest antioxidant capacities were observed in Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis L), onion (Allium cepa L), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris Cantley) and broccoli (Brassica oleracea L var botrytis L subvar cymosa). Mauritian vegetables therefore represent a significant source of phenolic antioxidants, with quercetin derivatives being most abundant, and this may contribute to their potential health benefits.",1
"Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values (0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation. This study provides direct comparative data on antioxidant capacity and total and individual phenolics contents of the 26 spice extracts.",1
"Focusing on 17 constituents, the polyphenol profiles of juices freshly made from various dessert (n = 4) and cider apple cultivars (n = 7) as well as commercially available apple juices (n = 24) were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and (HPLC)-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI(neg)-MS/MS) analyses. Significant differences in the total polyphenol content as well as the profiles of the apple cultivars under study were observed. For dessert apples the total polyphenol content ranged from 154 to 178 mg/L, whereas for 'old' German cider apple cultivars 261-970 mg/L were determined. Boskoop showed the highest (970 mg/L) and Granny Smith the lowest (154 mg/L) polyphenol content of the freshly prepared samples under study. Hydroxycinnamic acids, with chlorogenic acid as dominating constituent, ranged from 57 to 68 mg/L as well as from 134-593 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that from cider apples, respectively. Dessert apple juices showed lower contents of dihydrochalcones (10-35 mg/L) and flavan-3-ols (50-95 mg/L) compared to that of cider apples (34-171 mg/L and 70-393 mg/L, respectively). Quercetin and its derivatives were found from 0.4-4 mg/L and 0.4-27 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that of cider apples, respectively. Compared with freshly made juices, lower contents of polyphenols were determined in the commercial samples under study. Amounts ranging from 110-459 mg/L, dominated by chlorogenic acid with concentrations from 53-217 mg/L, were determined. Information about cultivar-typical apple polyphenol content and profile is important for bioactivity studies and, consequently, essential for the development of consumer-relevant products with particular nutritional functionalities.",1
"Murine chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the potential immunogenicity of the murine single-chain variable fragment domain may limit the persistence of CAR-T cell, leading to relapse. We performed a clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous and allogeneic humanized CD19-targeted CAR-T cell (hCART19) for R/R B-ALL. Fifty-eight patients (aged 13-74 years) were enrolled and treated between February 2020 and March 2022. The endpoints were complete remission (CR) rate, overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and safety. Overall, 93.1% (54/58) of patients achieved CR or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) by day 28, with 53 patients having minimal residual disease negativity. With a median follow-up of 13.5 months, the estimated 1-year OS and EFS were 73.6% (95% CI 62.1% to 87.4%) and 46.0% (95% CI 33.7% to 62.8%), with a median OS and EFS of 21.5 months and 9.5 months, respectively. No significant increase in human antimouse antibodies was observed following infusion (p=0.78). Duration of B-cell aplasia in the blood was observed for as long as 616 days, which was longer than that in our prior mCART19 trial. All toxicities were reversible, including severe cytokine release syndrome, which developed in 36% (21/58) of patients and severe neurotoxicity, which developed in 5% (3/58) of patients. Compared with our prior mCART19 trial, patients treated with hCART19 had longer EFS without increased toxicity. Additionally, our data also suggest that patients treated with consolidation therapy, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or CD22-targeted CAR-T cell, following hCART19 therapy had a longer EFS than those without consolidation therapy. hCART19 has good short-term efficacy and manageable toxicity in R/R B-ALL patients.

"A fast, precise and selective diode array HPLC method is presented for the extraction and analysis of soy isoflavonoids from foods and from human urine, plasma, and breast milk in support of mechanistic and epidemiologic studies assessing the potential cancer protective role of soya or isoflavones. Solid phase or solvent extraction was chosen for isolation, and enzymatic or acid hydrolysis procedures were used for aglycone production depending on the matrix to be analyzed. C-18 reversed-phase HPLC was applied to selectively separate and quantitate daidzein (1), glycitein (3), and genistein (4), including their malonyl (a) and acetyl (b) esters, and their mammalian metabolites equol (6) and O-desmethylangolensin (7), as well as formononetin (2), biochanin-A (5), and coumestrol (8) using a gradient elution system. UV absorbance scans and authentic standards were applied for identification purposes, additional to fluorometric monitoring, electrochemical detection, and GC/ MS analysis after trimethyl silylation. Detection limits of 20-microl injections were found to be 1.09, 0.53, 3.28, and 1.00 pmoles for daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin (DMA), respectively, by monitoring at the individual compound's absorption maximum. The proposed method was applied to monitor isoflavone levels in soy foods and in human plasma, urine and breast milk after challenge with roasted soybeans. Implications of the presented results on the potential activity of isoflavones to prevent cancer by exposing newborn infants to these agents are discussed.",1
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) stands as the primary contributor to childhood cancer-related mortality on a global scale. The development of the most conventional forms of this disease has been proposed to be conducted by two different steps influenced by different types of risk factors. The first step is led by a genetic insult that is presumably acquired before birth that transforms a healthy cell into a preleukemic one, which is maintained untransformed until the second step takes place. This necessary next step to leukemia development will be triggered by different risk factors to which children are exposed after birth. Murine models that recap the stepwise progression of B-ALL have been instrumental in identifying environmental and genetic factors that contribute to disease risk. Recent evidence from these models has demonstrated that specific environmental risk factors, such as common infections or gut microbiome dysbiosis, induce immune stress, driving the transformation of preleukemic cells, and harboring genetic alterations, into fully transformed leukemic cells. Such models serve as valuable tools for investigating the mechanisms underlying preleukemic events and can aid in the development of preventive approaches for leukemia in child. Here, we discuss the existing knowledge, learned from mouse models, of the impact of genetic and environmental risk factors on childhood B-ALL evolution and how B-ALL prevention could be reached by interfering with preleukemic cells.",0
"Biochips are small-scale devices capable of performing sensitive, real-time multi-analyte detection. In oncodiagnostics, these tools are of great interest due to their rapid response, simple architecture, low cost, and the requirement of small sample volumes. In this context, the present study describes the development and validation of self-assembled biochips using polypyrrole and graphene quantum dots for detection of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The most frequent oncogenes such as ETV6-RUNX1 and TCF3-PBX1, associated with the t(12;21)(p13;q22) and t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) translocations, respectively were targeted, as well as aggressive oncogenes, including KMT2A-AFF1 and TCF3-HLF, linked to t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(17;19)(q22;p13.3). The biochips were fabricated using simple additive manufacturing techniques and consist of a three-electrode electrochemical system. All fabrication steps and bioactivity assays were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Each step was evaluated by atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. During biorecognition assays, electrochemical changes characteristic of detection were observed, including a decrease in anodic peak currents and an increase in system impedance. The biochips achieved detection limits ranging from 9 to 29 copies of the oncogenes using label-free detection in 15 min. Therefore, the biochips developed in this study exhibit promising characteristics for the diagnosis of clinically relevant oncogenes.",0
"Tea flavonols are potent antioxidants and make up 2–3% of the water-soluble solids from tea leaves. In this paper, the conditions necessary for hydrolysing and analysing flavonols in tea leaves and tea infusions are optimised and an isocratic elution system for the determination of the hydrolysed flavonols by high-performance liquid chromotography is presented. Aqueous ethanol was selected as the best solution for hydrolysing flavonoids in tea leaves. The contents of flavonols on a dry weight base in green tea leaves ranged from 0.83–1.59, 1.79–4.05, and 1.56–3.31 g/kg, and in black tea leaves from 0.24–0.52, 1.04–3.03, and 1.72–2.31 g/kg for myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol, respectively. It was observed that the particle size of ground tea leaves significantly influenced the yield of flavonols. The contents of flavonols in different green tea infusions are given.",1
"Avascular necrosis (AVN) is a serious complication of high-dose steroid therapy for pediatric patients with leukemia/lymphoma. AVN affects multiple bones and joints, leading to significant pain in different bone regions, early-onset osteoarthritis, and early joint replacement. Early detection and intervention for AVN may prevent pain and progressive joint collapse. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and characterize the specific AVN locations in a cohort of pediatric and adolescent patients with leukemia/lymphoma using the newly developed Bone Location for AVN from STeroids (BLAST) classification system that considers epiphyseal, metaphyseal, and diaphyseal locations in long bones. An imaging database was queried for patients 25 years old and younger with a diagnosis of AVN and leukemia/lymphoma who required steroid treatment. Patient MRIs were reviewed, and AVN sites were classified using the BLAST system. AVN locations were described using descriptive statistics. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the odds of AVN bilaterality based on location. A total of 84 patients (49/35 males/females) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (B-cell 74%, T-cell 21%) or acute myeloid leukemia (5%) were included in this cohort. The median age was 14.8 years at leukemia diagnosis and 16.5 years at AVN diagnosis. Most AVN locations include the femur (87%), tibia (68%), and humerus (25%). On the basis of the BLAST classification, the most common sites of AVN overall include the proximal tibial metaphysis (61%), distal femoral metaphysis (60%) and epiphysis (60%), and femoral head epiphysis (50%). The most common sites of AVN in the tibia, humerus, and femur are proximal tibial metaphysis (89%), humeral head epiphysis (86%), and distal femoral metaphysis (68%) and epiphysis (68%), respectively. This analysis demonstrates that AVN in leukemia/lymphoma patients on steroid therapy has a clear predilection for specific locations in long bones. Using the BLAST classification, practitioners are better equipped to characterize the location of AVN, monitor high-risk locations for joint collapse, and track early outcomes of preventative treatment. The development of prospective multicenter AVN study groups and screening protocols for early detection will be critical to improve functional outcomes and joint preservation for leukemia/lymphoma survivors and all other patients taking high-dose steroids. Level II-retrospective cohort study.",0
"The study of the effect of the enzymes tannase, α-galactosidase, phytase and viscozyme on the phenolic composition of lentil flours, in a semi pilot scale stirred fermentor, shows that important modifications occur. Among them, hydroxycinnamic compounds and proanthocyanidins are significantly decreased after the enzymatic treatments. However, quercetin 3-O rutinoside and luteolin increase and reach the highest concentration with tannase. The formation of trans-resveratrol was observed by the action of tannase and phytase, and gallic acid by the action of phytase, α-galactosidase and tannase. The antioxidant capacity of the methanolic extracts was determined by their free radical scavenging activity, using the DPPH test, to study the differences in the behaviour of polyphenolics compounds as antioxidants after the different enzymatic treatments. The treatments with viscozyme, α-galactosidase or tannase produce an increase in the antioxidant activity when compared to raw lentils. The results of the analysis of principal components to examine the relationship among antioxidant activity (EC50) (DPPH test) and the concentrations of polyphenolics in all lentils samples, show that the quercetin 3-O rutinoside appears to be the compound with the greatest influence on the EC50 values.",1
"Many studies have been carried out on bioactivities of individual herbs, however, no collective study on their comparative antioxidant and cytoprotective activities against oxidative damage has been reported. We selected 17 common commercial herbs and studied their relative phenolic contents, antioxidant activities, and cytoprotective activities on gap–junction intercellular communication and antioxidative enzymes in vitro under the same conditions. Total polyphenol content ranged from 464 to 870 gallic acid equivalents (GAE) mg/100g and total flavonoid content from 212 to 494 catechin equivalents (CE) mg/100g. Among the samples, chamomile, rosehip, hawthorn, lemon verbena, and green tea contained relatively high total phenolics (769–844mg GAE/100g) and flavonoids (400–4mg CE/100g). Chamomile also showed the highest antioxidant activity with 960mg/100g of vitamin C equivalent (VCE), followed by hawthorn (929mg VCE/100g) and black tea (916mg VCE/100g). Total phenolic and total flavonoids showed a higher correlation with antioxidant activity. Most of herbs enhanced cell viability and showed protective effects against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79-4) cells. Furthermore, herbs used in this study showed higher protective effect on gap–junction intercellular communication (GJIC) as compared to gallic acid and catechin, and also enhanced activity of the antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in a dose-dependent manner.",1
"Despite advancements in chemotherapy and the availability of novel therapies, the outcome of adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of B-ALL. Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) is a poor prognostic factor for multiple cancers. Here, the expression of BRG1 was found to be higher in patients with B-ALL, irrespective of the molecular subtype, than in healthy individuals, and its overexpression was associated with a poor prognosis. Upregulation of BRG1 accelerated cell cycle progression into the S phase, resulting in increased cell proliferation, whereas its downregulation facilitated the apoptosis of B-ALL cells. Mechanistically, BRG1 occupies the transcriptional activation site of PPP2R1A, thereby inhibiting its expression and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to regulate the proto-oncogenes c-Myc and BCL-2. Consistently, silencing of BRG1 and administration of PFI-3 (a specific inhibitor targeting BRG1) significantly inhibited the progression of leukemia and effectively prolonged survival in cell-derived xenograft mouse models of B-ALL. Altogether, this study demonstrates that BRG1-induced overactivation of the PPP2R1A/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays an important role in promoting the progression of B-ALL. Therefore, targeting BRG1 represents a promising strategy for the treatment of B-ALL in adults.",0
"Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 (25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from pistachio consumption.",1
"Pediatric leukemia outcomes are poor in most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and exacerbated by health care systems ill equipped to manage cancer. Effective leukemia management in LMICs involves curating epidemiologic data; providing health care workforce specialty training; developing evidence-based treatments and supportive care programs; safeguarding access to medications and equipment; providing patient and family psychosocial, financial, and nutritional support; partnering with nongovernmental organizations, and ensuring treatment adherence. In 2013, through a partnership between North-American and Mexican institutions, we used the WHO Our approach led to a fully-staffed leukemia service, sustainable training programs, evidence-based and data-driven projects to improve clinical outcomes, and funding for medications, supplies, and personnel through local partnerships. Preimplementation and postimplementation 5-year overall survival for the entire cohort of children with ALL, children with standard-risk ALL, and children with high-risk ALL improved from 59% to 65% ( Using the health systems strengthening WHO",0
"Methanol extracts of seeds from 23 accessions of 3 Phaseolus vulgaris ecotypes (“Sarconi”, “Lamon”, “Zolfino del Pratomagno”), grown in different Italian regions (Basilicata, Veneto, Tuscany) were analyzed for their flavonoid content. Flavonoid glycosides were found in the seed coat from ten accessions of the “Zolfino” ecotype and in one accession of the “Sarconi” ecotype. From highest to lowest concentration these compounds were kaempferol 3-O-glucoside (compound 2), kaempferol 3-O-xylosylglucoside (compound 1) and a not completely identified kaempferol monoglucoside (compound 3). Total flavonol content varied from 0.19 to 0.84g/kg of seed fresh weight. A great variability in the total flavonol content, being between 18% and 50%, and in the relative abundance of different kaempferol derivatives was observed for the same genotypes sampled in the original locations in the 2001–2003 period. Fluctuation in flavonol content suggests that further researches are necessary for an exhaustive comprehension of physiological mechanisms influencing the expression of these phenolic compounds. Obtained results evidenced that some Italian bean ecotypes may be an important source of functional compounds as kaempferol glycosides.",1
"The impact of extraction methodology and polarity of extraction solvents on the assay of phenolic compounds was investigated using parsley (Petroselinum crispum) flakes as a model substrate. This systematic study was undertaken to address substantial variations in the extraction procedures, solvents and conditions as described in the recent literature. Five different extraction procedures [shaking, vortex mixing, sonication, stirring and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE)] and three different solvents (methanol, ethanol and acetone), with five different solvent to water ratios per solvent, were used for extraction. Extracts were analyzed for phenolic content by high-performance liquid chromatography and Folin–Ciocalteu assays. The yields of phenolic compounds extracted with a pressurized liquid extractor were comparable to or better than those of four classical extraction procedures. Optimum extraction efficiency with PLE was obtained when extractions were performed with four extraction cycles using ethanol–water (50:50, v/v). The amount of apiin (4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone 7-apiosylglucoside) and malonylapiin (apigenin malonylapiosylglucoside) isolated from parsley varied with the composition of extraction solvent. Apiin extractability was found to be a maximum when the solvent (ethanol, methanol or acetone) to water ratio was 30:70 (v/v), whereas higher amounts of malonylapiin were isolated with a reverse solvent to water ratio (70:30, v/v). Malonylapiin was not detected when parsley samples were extracted with organic solvent to water ratios of 10:90 (v/v) and 30:70 (v/v)",1
"T lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LBL/ALL) is a highly aggressive hematologic malignancy, with particularly poor outcomes for refractory/relapsed (R/R) patients. This article reports the efficacy and safety of V-CHG regimen (Venetoclax, cytarabine, homoharringtonine, G-CSF) in the treatment of three R/R T-LBL/ALL cases. One 69 years old female patient with T-ALL experienced a twice relapse and achieved morphological complete remission (CR) with one cycle of V-CHG regimen. Another 65 years old female patient with T-LBL progressed to T-ALL after continuous CR for 10 months and failed by two different salvage chemotherapy regimens. She achieved minimal residual disease (MRD) negative CR with a third-line treatment based on V-CHG regimen. The third T-ALL patient was a 26 years old male who resistant to VDCP induction regimen and achieved morphological CR with one cycle of V-CHG regimen, and obtained MRD negative CR after second cycle treatment. All the three patients were well tolerated to the V-CHG regimen. The results of this study indicate that the V-CHG regimen is effective and safe for R/R T-LBL/ALL, warranting further application in the future.",0
"To investigate the efficacy and safety of CD19/CD3 bisecific monoclonalantibody (Blinatumomab) in the treatment of adult patients with relapsed / refractory Ph-negative acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R-B-ALL). Ten adult R/R B-ALL patients were all treated with Blinatumomab. Each treatment cycle was administered for 28 days and stopped for 14 days. The dose was 9 μg/day for the first 7 days of cycle 1, and 28 μg/day for days 8-28 if there were no adverse reactions. From the second cycle onwards, the daily dose was 28 μg. The remission, survival time (EFS and OS) and adverse reactions were observed after treatment. Nine patients with curative effect could be evaluated. Four patients achieved CR after one course, and one patient achieved CR after two courses, the overall remission rate was 55.6%(5/9). The median EFS was 4 months (1-12 months), and the median OS was 6 months (2-44 months). Nine of the 10 patients had fever of different degrees. Serum levels of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and IFN-γ increased. Two patients resumed medication after 1 week of treatment interruption due to neurotoxicity and CRS, respectively. One patient was discontinued due to grade 3 CRS and died of tropical candidiaemia. Blinatumomab has a good response rate in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-ALL patients, but the duration of remission is shorter. Drug-related adverse reactions are mainly CRS and neurotoxicity. Inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-10, IL-17 and IFN-γ can be used as indicators to monitor CRS. The bisspecificity MAbs provide an opportunity for subsequent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in R/R-B-ALL patients. 博纳吐单抗治疗成人复发/难治Ph阴性急性B 淋巴细胞白血病临床研究. 探讨CD19/CD3双抗体博纳吐单抗（blinatumomab）治疗成人难治和复发性Ph阴性急性B淋巴细胞白血病(RR-B-ALL)的疗效及安全性. 共10例成人R/R B-ALL患者接受博纳吐单抗治疗，每治疗周期用药28 d，停14 d。第1个周期的d 1-7 d剂量为9 μg/d，如无不良反应，d 8-28剂量为28 μg/d。从第2个周期开始，每日剂量均为28 μg。观察治疗后白血病缓解情况、生存期(EFS和OS)及不良反应. 可评价疗效患者9例，4例在1个疗程后获得CR，1例在2个疗程后获CR，总缓解率为55.6%（5/9例），中位EFS为4（1-12）个月，中位OS为6（2-44）个月。10例患者中9例出现不同程度的发热；血清IL-6、IL-10、IL-17和IFN-γ等细胞因子水平发现不同程度升高；2例患者分别因神经毒性和CRS中断治疗1周后恢复用药；1例患者因3级CRS停药并死于热带念珠菌血症. 博纳吐单抗用于治疗复发/难治性B-ALL患者获得较好的缓解率，但缓解期维持时间较短。药物相关不良反应主要为CRS和神经毒性，细胞因子IL-6、IL-10、IL-17和IFN-γ可以作为监测CRS的指标。该双特异性单克隆抗体为R/R-ALL患者异基因造血干细胞移植提供了机会.",0
"Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.",1
A simple fractionation method was developed to analyze phenolic compounds other than anthocyanins in red grapes using HPLC. The methanol extract of Concord and de Chaunac grapes was passed through a preconditioned C18 SEP-PAK and phenolic compounds other than anthocyanins were selectively fractionated with ethyl acetate. Anthocyanins were eluted with MeOH-HCl and analyzed by a spectrophotometric method. Phenolics other than anthocyanins were analyzed by HPLC. This technique is easy to use and convenient for phenolic analysis in both white and red grapes.,1
"The effect of time and temperature on the content of vitamin C, total polyphenols and individual phenolic compounds as well as on the antioxidant activity of two commercial orange juices was studied. The polyphenol content was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu and HPLC methods. The two methods, SPE versus direct injection following a simple treatment of samples, were compared to assess two techniques of sample preparation. For antioxidant capacity determination, DPPH and FRAP assays were used. All analyses were carried out for fresh juices and after storage at 18, 28 and 38°C for 2, 4 and 6 months. It was found that vitamin C and free and conjugated hydroxycinnamic acids were the most affected by both duration and temperature of storage. The decrease in the content of polyphenols and vitamin C upon storage was reflected by the decrease in the antioxidant capacity of orange juices. Small changes in flavanone content were observed, indicating high stability of these compounds upon storage.",1
"The phenolic composition of juice derived from fruits of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array and electrochemical detection. Flavonols were found to be the predominating polyphenols while phenolic acids and catechins represent minor components. Of the seven flavonols identified, isorhamnetin 3-O-glycosides were the most important representatives quantitatively. However, because of their structural properties, they were poor radical scavengers as shown by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Phenolic compounds such as quercetin 3-O-glycosides, catechins, and hydroxybenzoic acids with a catechol structure exhibited good antioxidant capacities, but their concentration in sea buckthorn juice was small. These phenolic compounds, determined by HPLC, accounted for less than 5% of the total antioxidant activity of the filtered juice. Ascorbic acid was shown to be the major antioxidant in sea buckthorn juice. Because of its high concentration of 1.22 g/L, it contributes approximately 75% to total antioxidant activity. The remaining difference can be attributed to higher molecular weight flavan-3-ols (proanthocyanidins), which were determined photometrically after acid depolymerization to colored anthocyanidins.",1
"Although the prognosis of Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) has improved with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and stem cell transplantation, prevention of relapse after transplantation remains a concern. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of TKI prophylaxis with imatinib and dasatinib on long-term outcomes after transplantation. Patients with Ph+ ALL who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at first complete remission (CR1) and received TKI prophylaxis after allo-HSCT were included in this retrospective analysis. Two cohorts were established based on the choice of TKI prophylaxis: the imatinib (Ima) and dasatinib (Das) cohorts. The survival and safety outcomes of these cohorts were compared. Ninety-one patients in the Ima cohort and 50 in the Das cohort were included. After a median follow-up of 50.6 months, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse, nonrelapse mortality rate, and overall survival in the Ima and Das cohorts were 16.1% and 12.5%, 5.2% and 9.8%, and 86.5% and 77.6%, respectively, with no statistical differences. The cumulative incidence of mild chronic graft-versus-host disease was higher in the Das cohort. The most common adverse event was neutropenia (64.7% vs. 69.5%). The Das cohort had a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (25.5% vs. 2.3%) and gastrointestinal reaction (48.9% vs. 31.4%) than the Ima cohort. The proportion of patients treated on schedule was significantly lower in the Das cohort than in the Ima cohort, and drug intolerance was the main reason for protocol violation. For patients with Ph+ ALL undergoing allo-HSCT in CR1, imatinib prophylaxis achieved long-term outcomes similar to those of dasatinib.",0
"In a study aimed at elucidation of the possible role of dietary phytoestrogens in the growth of breast cancer, it was necessary to develop a convenient, accurate, and reproducible method for the characterization and quantification of isoflavone metabolites in the serum of MMTV mice that were fed diets containing different amounts of these polyphenols. The analytical method is based on liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode, using deuterated genistein as internal standard. The identified metabolites were genistein and dihydrodaidzein (DHD); their average concentrations in serum were 0.71 and 0.21 microM, respectively, for animals fed 1.5 mg/day of genistein and 0.7 mg/day of daidzein. This method assured a limit of quantification of 0.04 microM for genistein and 0.08 microM for DHD, and a limit of detection of 0.018 microM for genistein and 0.035 microM for DHD. The coefficient of variation was 8.9% for genistein and lower than 15% for DHD. This study provides the first data indicating the presence of dihydrodaidzein in serum of mice fed diets containing soy proteins.",1
"Kale (Brassica oleracea var. Acephala), broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis italica), Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea L. var. gemmifera) and green and white cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) were used to determine their contents of antioxidising agents: vitamin C, carotenoids and polyphenols. The examined vegetables were found to contain between 40.6 and 107mg/100g FW of vitamin C, from 0.04 to 2.7mg/100g FW of carotenoids, and from 144 to 773mg/100g FW of polyphenols. Cauliflower was found to contain the smallest amount of these compounds and kale the largest. The antioxidant activity of the vegetables was determined on the basis of their ability to extinguish the ABTS free radical. The aquathermal processes to which the vegetables were subsequently subjected reduced their antioxidant activity, mainly due to escape of vitamin C and polyphenols into the water environment. These losses were largest in the case of leafy or highly fragmented vegetables.",1
"One of the most frequent genes affected in pediatric ALL is the CDKN2A/2B gene, acting as a secondary cooperating event and playing an important role in cell-cycle regulation and chemosensitivity. Despite its inclusion in combined CNA (copy-number alterations) classifiers, like the IKZF1plus entity and the UKALL CNA profile, the prognostic impact of the individual gene deletions outside the context of a combined CNA evaluation remains controversial. Addressing the CDKN2A/2B deletions' additive prognostic effect in current risk-stratification algorithms, we present a retrospective study of a Greek pediatric ALL cohort comprising 247 patients studied over a 24-year period (2000-2023). Herein, we provide insight regarding the correlation with disease features, MRD clearance, and independent prognostic significance for this ALL cohort treated with contemporary BFM-based treatment protocols. Within an extended follow-up time of 135 months, the presence of the CDKN2A/2B deletions (biallelic or monoallelic) was associated with inferior EFS rates (65.1% compared to 91.8% for the gene non-deleted subgroup,",0
"Physico-chemical characteristics, cooking quality, nutrients, antinutrients, domestic processing effects and protein quality of black bean (Phaseolus) were investigated. The nutrient composition was similar to other conventional legumes with protein content of 29.33%. The antinutritional factors in raw seeds such as tannins (10.71 mg/g), free phenols (2.27 mg/g), phytates (2.16 mg/g), and trypsin inhibitors could be substantially eliminated by soaking, pressure-cooking, discarding the broth after pressure-cooking and decortication. Although the protein quality was lower than the reference protein diet, the grain has promising food value in traditional composite diets.",1
"In order to evaluate the potential of climate change mitigation measures on soil physiochemical properties, an experiment based on the application of five agroecological practices such as the addition of composted olive-mill wastes, recycling pruning residue, cover crops, organic insect manure, and reduced soil tillage, solely or combined, was conducted over two years (2020 to 2022) in a 48-year-old olive plantation. The results showed significant increases in soil water content during the spring and summer periods for the combined treatment (compost + pruning residue + cover crops) (ALL) compared to the control (CONT) by 41.6% and 51.3%, respectively. Also, ALL expressed the highest soil organic matter (4.33%) compared to CONT (1.65%) at 0-10 cm soil depth. When comparing soil nutrient contents, ALL (37.86 mg kg",0
"Monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based therapies targeting CD19, CD20, and CD22 have revolutionized B-ALL treatment, offering precision and reduced systemic toxicity by engaging immune mechanisms to eliminate leukemic cells. This review synthesizes literature from PubMed, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov (2000-2024), focusing on clinical outcomes and resistance mechanisms. Bispecific T-cell engagers (e.g. blinatumomab) and CD22-directed antibody-drug conjugates (e.g. inotuzumab ozogamicin) demonstrate robust efficacy in relapsed/refractory disease. Advances in antibody engineering, such as Fc optimization, nanobodies, and humanization, enhance tumor targeting and therapeutic safety. Persistent challenges include antigen escape, stromal-mediated resistance, and treatment-related toxicities. Combinatorial approaches integrating mAbs with CAR-T cells or checkpoint inhibitors show promise in overcoming resistance pathways. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and deep learning are transforming antibody design by predicting epitope binding, enabling de novo protein engineering, and streamlining affinity maturation. These innovations accelerate the development of next-generation therapies, underscoring the evolving potential of precision immunotherapy of B-ALL.",0
"Lymphocyte depletion chemotherapy CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-modified T (CAR-T) cell immunotherapy is an innovative approach for the treatment of refractory or relapsed B-cell malignancies. This method also has the occurrence of infection, and there has been no systematic analysis of infectious complications. In our study, we intend to analyze the infection in patients between day 0 and day 90 by analyzing the data of 40 patients who received CD19 CAR-T cell therapy collected in our hospital. We assessed risk factors for infection before and after treatment using Poisson and Cox regression, respectively. A cohort study was used, including patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 40 patients were infected for the first time occurred at a median of 6 days after CAR-T cell infusion, and 8 (20%) had 10 infections within 28 days after CAR-T cell infusion, on days 29 and 29. The infection density between 90 days was lower at 0.67. This resulted in an infection density of 1.19 infections per 100 days. Two patients (5%) developed invasive fungal infections and two patients (5%) developed life-threatening or fatal infections. In an adjusted model for baseline characteristics, patients with ALL, ≥4 prior antitumor regimens, and receiving the highest CAR-T cell dose had higher infection densities at 28 days. The incidence of infection was comparable to that observed in clinical trials of salvage associated with infection after CAR-T cell infusion.",0
"Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Ph+ALL) is treated as standard of care (SoC) by imatinib-based treatment combined with induction and consolidation chemotherapy followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first remission. The German Multicenter ALL Study Group for Adult ALL (GMALL) reports about a trial to evaluate the impact of ponatinib-based therapy, blinatumomab treatment for suboptimal responders, and the possibility of omission of SoC Allo SCT in optimal responders entitled GMALL-EVOLVE. Herein, imatinib is randomized versus ponatinib as frontline treatment combined with chemotherapy, optimal responders also get randomized between SCT and chemo-immunotherapy, and suboptimal responders receive immunotherapy before SCT. The trial is registered under the EudraCT number 2022-000760-21. This trial will answer several major questions in the treatment of Ph+ALL.",0
This paper reports the chlorogenic acids content of unroasted chicory root and eleven coffee substitutes which contain either chicory or dandelion. Unroasted chicory root contained CQA and diCQA but at a much lower level than green coffee beans. In the roasted products only 5-CQA was found consistently and 4-CQA occasionally at levels approximately two orders of magnitude lower than in the corresponding roasted coffee products. The roasted substitutes were characterised chromatographically by very large amounts (some 80 to 95% of total chromatogram area) of rapidly eluting material. The chromatograms of most substitutes were characterised by a peak provisionally identified as 5-hydroxymethyl furfural.,1
"Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due to the high intake of soybean products.",1
"Chromosomal translocations involving the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) locus generate potent oncogenic fusion proteins (oncoproteins) that disrupt regulation of developmental gene expression. By profiling the oncoprotein-target sites of 36 broadly representative MLL-rearranged leukemia samples, including three samples that underwent a lymphoid-to-myeloid lineage-switching event in response to therapy, we find the genomic enrichment of the oncoprotein is highly variable between samples and subject to dynamic regulation. At high levels of expression, the oncoproteins preferentially activate either an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) program, enriched for pro-B-cell genes, or an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) program, enriched for hematopoietic-stem-cell genes. The fusion-partner-specific-binding patterns over these gene sets are highly correlated with the prevalence of each mutation in ALL versus AML. In lineage-switching samples the oncoprotein levels are reduced and the oncoproteins preferentially activate granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) genes. In a sample that lineage switched during treatment with the menin inhibitor revumenib, the oncoprotein and menin are reduced to undetectable levels, but ENL, a transcriptional cofactor of the oncoprotein, persists on numerous oncoprotein-target loci, including genes in the GMP-like lineage-switching program. We propose MLL oncoproteins promote lineage-switching events through dynamic chromatin binding at lineage-specific target genes, and may support resistance to menin inhibitors through similar changes in chromatin occupancy.",0
"Catechins, compounds that belong to the flavonoid class, are potentially beneficial to human health. To enable epidemiological evaluation of these compounds, data on their contents in foods are required. HPLC with UV and fluorescence detection was used to determine the levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) in 24 types of fruits, 27 types of vegetables and legumes, some staple foods, and processed foods commonly consumed in The Netherlands. Most fruits, chocolate, and some legumes contained catechins. Levels varied to a large extent: from 4.5 mg/kg in kiwi fruit to 610 mg/kg in black chocolate. (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin were the predominant catechins; GC, EGC, and ECg were detected in some foods, but none of the foods contained EGCg. The data reported here provide a base for the epidemiological evaluation of the effect of catechins on the risk for chronic diseases.",1
"Current therapies, including autologous CAR-T immunotherapy, fail to cure half of infants with KMT2A-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (KMT2Ar-ALL), a disease characterized by frequent central nervous system involvement, poor treatment response, early relapse and lineage switching. More effective treatment strategies, including the availability of 'off-the-shelf' immunotherapies is particularly relevant in infants. PROM1/CD133 is a direct target of KMT2A-fusion oncoproteins and is expressed on leukemic cells. Allogeneic iNKT cells, 'innately' more powerful effectors than T cells can be deployed 'off-the-shelf' without risk of acute graft-versus-host disease. Here, we equip iNKT with CD19- and/or CD133-targeting CARs and investigate their anti-leukaemia activity against KMT2Ar-ALL in relevant in vitro and in vivo models. Compared to mono-specific counterparts and dual, bi-specific CAR-T, bi-specific CD19-CD133 CAR-iNKT have a more potent anti-leukemia activity, effectively targeting both CAR antigen-high and -low leukemia. Bi-specific CAR-iNKT eradicate medullary and, notably, leptomeningeal leukemia and induce sustained remissions without discernible hematologic toxicity. Mechanistically, the more potent anti-leukemia effect of CAR-iNKT over CAR-T cells is mediated by a pronounced CAR- and CAR antigen-dependent upregulation of the innate activating receptor NKG2D on CAR-iNKT and its engagement by its corresponding ligands on KMT2Ar-ALL cells. This ensures effective leukemia targeting even with downregulation of CD133 or CD19. Thus, by engaging with two different types of leukemia-associated antigens i.e., CAR antigens and NKG2D ligands, CAR-iNKT provide a powerful platform for the treatment of KMT2Ar-ALL. This approach can be readily adapted for other high-risk malignancies, including those with otherwise difficult to target leptomeningeal involvement.",0
"Oxidation stability is an important property of olive oil quality and is affected by different antioxidant compounds whose levels may be influenced by cultivar, year and place of production. Polyphenols, tocopherols, carotenoids, chlorophylls and fatty acids levels were correlated to oxidative stability in olive oils from three experiments: cultivar influence (18 cultivars assessed for 4 years in the same place); environmental influence by mesoclimatic (4 cultivars from 17 sites in a single region for 4 years) and macroclimate conditions (3 cultivars from 3 different regions for 3 years). Total polyphenols and saturated on polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio were shown to be the major factors in oil antioxidant stability, according to multivariate regression models. Among the surveyed cultivars, oils from ‘Leccino’ and from three ‘local’, minor cultivars (‘Miniol’, ‘Regina’ and ‘Rossanello’) resulted in higher oxidative stability and oils from cultivars grown in Tuscany (central Italy) showed the highest oxidative stability by comparison with northern and southern regions.",1
"Ordinary cooking of presoaked and unsoaked seeds of six cultivars of moongbean (Vigna radiata L.) lowered phytic acid, polyphenols, trypsin inhibitors and improved in vitro digestibility of protein and starch, and availability of Ca, Fe and Zn when compared to unprocessed seeds. However, the effect was more pronounced on ordinary cooking of presoaked seeds followed by cooking of unsoaked seeds and presoaked seeds alone. A significant increase in vitro digestibility of protein (34–48%), and starch (31–62%) may be ascribed to the reduced content of phytic acid (45–65%) polyphenols (34–70%) and trypsin inhibitor activity (42–55%) after ordinary cooking of presoaked seeds of moongbean cultivars. Therefore, ordinary cooking of soaked seeds was the most effective treatment in improving the nutritional quality of moongbean.",1
"In juice of 5 varieties of sour cherries and one variety of sweet cherries the following compounds have been identified: salicylic, cinnamic, gentisic, quinic, p-coumaric, gallic, and isoferulic acids. Using the method of the internal standard the quantities of these acids were calculated. Except for 2 varieties in all the rest, salicylic acid is contained in the largest quantity. Cinnamic and quinic acids are found in very small quantities.",1
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a breakthrough in hematologic malignancies, such as acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Monitoring this treatment is recommended, although standardized protocols have not been developed yet. This work compares two flow cytometry monitoring strategies and correlates this technique with qPCR method. CAR-T cells were detected by two different flow-cytometry protocols (A and B) in nine blood samples from one healthy donor and five B-ALL patients treated with Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah®, USA). HIV-1 viral load allowed CAR detection by qPCR, using samples from seven healthy donors and nine B-ALL patients. CAR detection by protocol A and B did not yield statistically significant differences (1.9% vs. 11.8% CD3 + CAR+, p = 0.07). However, protocol B showed a better discrimination of the CD3 + CAR+ population. A strong correlation was observed between protocol B and qPCR (r = 0.7, p < 0.0001). CD3 + CAR+ cells were detected by flow cytometry only when HIV-1 viral load was above 10",0
"To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared with UV- and fluorescence detection.",1
"Eugenol and gallic acid are reported from the flower buds of Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merr. & Perry (clove). Both the compounds have been shown to give interesting biological activities and hence serve as biomarkers. We report a simple TLC densitometric method for the quantification of eugenol and gallic acid in clove. The method was validated for precision, repeatability and accuracy. The method was found to be precise with RSD of 0.61 and 1.3 (intraday) and 0.96 and 0.24 (interday) for different concentrations of eugenol and gallic acid respectively. Instrumental precision was 0.24 and 0.21 (% CV) for eugenol and gallic acid respectively. Accuracy of the method was checked by conducting recovery study at two different levels for eugenol and gallic acid and the average percentage recoveries were found to be 99.79% and 97.90% respectively. The contents of eugenol and gallic acid in different samples of clove, as estimated by the proposed method, were found to be in the range of 12.9–14.6% and 0.31–0.61% respectively. The proposed HPTLC method for the estimation gallic acid and eugenol was found to be simple, precise, specific, sensitive and accurate and can be used for routine quality control of clove.",1
"Studies addressing the role of haploidentical as alternative to HLA-matched donors for stem cell transplantation (SCT) often include patients with diverse hematological malignancies in different remission statuses. We compared outcomes of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing SCT in second complete remission (CR2) from haploidentical (n = 25) versus HLA-matched donor (n = 51). Patients were equally distributed across both groups according to age, immunophenotype, time to and site of relapse, relapse risk-group allocation, and minimal residual disease (MRD) before SCT. Incidence of graft failure, acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and other early complications did not differ between both groups. We found no differences in overall survival (58.7% versus 59.5%; These results support the role of haploidentical donor SCT in children with ALL in CR2.",0
"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the predominant hematological malignancy in pediatric populations, originating from B- or T-cell precursors within the bone marrow. The disease exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity, both at the molecular level and in terms of clinical presentation. A complex interplay between inherited and acquired genetic alterations contributes to disease pathogenesis, often resulting in the disruption of cellular functions integral to the leukemogenic process. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 as a gene editing tool has revolutionized biological research, underscoring its potential to modify specific genomic loci implicated in cancer. Enhanced understanding of molecular alterations in ALL has facilitated significant advancements in therapeutic strategies. In this review, we scrutinize the application of CRISPR/Cas9 as a tool for identifying genetic targets to improve therapy, circumvent drug resistance, and facilitate CAR-T cell-based immunotherapy. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and future prospects of CRISPR/Cas9 applications in ALL.",0
"Fresh parsley leaves and dried parsley flakes were analysed for furanocoumarins. This is the first reported isolation of the linear furanocoumarin, saxalin, from parsley. The coumarin, graveolone, has been previously shown to occur in parsley cell suspension culture; however, this is the first description of its isolation from the plant. Psoralen, bergapten, xanthotoxin, isoimperatorin, isopimpinellin, oxypeucedanin, and oxypeucedanin hydrate were also found, and the levels of psoralen, bergapten, xanthotoxin and isopimpinellin were quantified by HPLC in fresh and dried parsley flakes. Fresh parsley leaves were found to have a total of 112 μgg− fr. wt. One brand of parsley flakes had a total of 304 μg g− dry wt of the three major photosensitizing linear furanocoumarins (psoralen, bergapten and xanthotoxin).",1
"Ten apple varieties, harvested at commercial maturity, were analysed, paying special attention to the level of phenolic compounds and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity. The results pointed to great quantitative differences in the composition of the apple varieties, and particularly in their phenolic contents. Their total polyphenol content ranged from 2.3 to 3.6 g/kg. Chlorogenic acid was the main phenolic compound found in the varieties studied, and its concentrations varied from 30 to 430 mg/kg, and were 4–20 times higher than those of catechins. Only in Szampion and Elstar were the concentrations of catechins higher. Amongst the flavanol monomers, the main compound was (–)epicatechin, whose concentration varied from 18 to 89 mg/kg. The (+)catechin concentration ranged from 4 to 21 mg/kg. The dominant proanthocyanidins were oligomers up to trimers. In Warta apples, the concentrations of these oligomers were about 3 times higher than those of monomers. The level of PPO activity ranged from 270 units (U)/g in Szampion to 3120 U/g in Warta. No correlation was found between the concentrations of certain phenolic compounds, nor between PPO activity and phenolic or ascorbic acid concentrations. The results gave important information regarding the best use of the apple varieties investigated, i.e. for direct consumption due to their high nutritional value, or for processing.",1
"Total arabinoxylan (AXt), water-extractable arabinoxylan (WeAX) and ferulic acid (FA) from five cultivars of durum wheat (Triticum durumL.), grown under four different agronomic conditions, were measured. Among the varieties analysed, AXt, WeAX and FA contents ranged between 4·07%–6·02%, 0·37%–0·56% and 0·784 mg/g–7·98 mg/g, respectively. High genetic and agronomic variability was detected for AXt, WeAX and FA. AXt and FA increased sharply in milling products for extraction rates above 60%. FA was quantified in durum wheat milling fractions. High concentrations of FA esterified to cell-wall arabinoxylans were found in the aleurone layer (69% of total FA), germ and seedcoat (26·6% of total FA). Only trace amounts were detected in the starchy endosperm (1·4% of total FA). A highly significant correlation appeared between AXt and FA contents.",1
"The influence of harvest time on the intensity of bitterness and the level of phenol compounds in olive oil from the region of western Istria, obtained from 2 local (Bianchera and Busa) and one introduced, Italian variety (Leccino) was studied. Olive fruits were harvested at 3 different harvesting periods, during 4 successive crops seasons. Immediately after harvesting, the fruits were processed under the same conditions in a pilot plant. Basic quality parameters, the content of total polyphenols, o-diphenols and the intensity of bitterness were determined in oil samples. Samples of oil obtained from the Bianchera and Busa varieties were additionally tested for stability at elevated temperature (98 °C) and under the influence of UV-light. The results elaborated statistically showed the level of phenol compounds and the intensity of bitterness to be significantly influenced by both the harvest time and olive variety, with the influence of harvest time being more pronounced. The applied tests for accelerated deterioration of oil indicated a more rapid increase in the peroxide value in oil samples of both varieties exposed to UV-light than in those exposed to elevated temperature. Both tests showed better stability of the oil obtained from the Bianchera variety.",1
"We found that peptides or amino acids constituted the main fractions of water-soluble nitrogenous compounds in green peas and string beans (44% and 79%, respectively). Their proportion increased after processing, especially in frozen peas and beans (61% and 95%, respectively). The content of phenolic compounds was decreased more after industrial processing (by 40% in peas and 50–70% in beans) than after cooking (by 20% in peas and 0–35% in beans). Antiradical activity against ABTS•+ (2,2′-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid]) was much higher in aqueous extracts of peas and beans (33 and 45 μmol Trolox g−1 d.m., respectively) than in aqueous acetone extracts (approximately 17 μmol Trolox g−1 d.m. in both). In most cases, the activity decreased after processing. Both aqueous and acetone extracts of peas showed equal activity against DPPH• (2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), whereas in the case of beans this activity was four times lower in aqueous than in acetone extracts. Both reductions and increases of these activities were noted after processing.",1
"Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and chlorobenzene, respectively.",1
"Using a direct-injection HPLC method with isocratic elution and UV detection, the isomers of free resveratrol and their glucosides (polydatin) have been assayed in nearly 700 commercial red wines from most of the world's areas of production. The highest concentrations of polydatin were found in wines from the Midi and Rhone Valley of France, Canada, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and South America. In the last three regions, the polydatin concentrations exceeded those of free resveratrol which were the lowest of all categories examined, suggesting that the high sugar content of warm climate grapes may favor the glycosylation of resveratrol. In nine regions, the concentration of cis-polydatin exceeded that of trans-polydatin, the reverse being the case in five, yet in all trans-resveratrol concentrations exceeded those of cis-resveratrol. There was only a weak negative correlation overall between polydatin and resveratrol concentrations when all wines were included in the analysis. The low values for both polydatin and resveratrol in Californian wines are consistent with the notion that, despite high sugar content, some grapes may fail to express resveratrol synthetic enzymes due to genetic characteristics or to lack of environmental stress, and consequently little of the free resveratrol is available for glycosylation. The influence of cultivar was examined in wines from several regions. Among wines from California, Australia, South America and Canada, highest polydatin concentrations were found respectively in those from Zinfandel, Shiraz, Merlot and Pinot noir. Wines from the Northern Rhone Valley (predominantly Shiraz) had lower concentrations than those from the Southern Rhone where Mourvedre, Grenache, Carignane and Cinsault predominate. The high polydatin and very low resveratrol concentrations of Vintage Ports highlight enological techniques, particularly duration of fermentation, as important modulating factors. The concentrations of polydatin present in most red wines are likely to add significantly to the presumed health benefits attributable to resveratrol.",1
"This manuscript reports a rare case of CUX1::NUTM1-positive B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in a 25-year-old female patient who experienced early relapse and a poor clinical outcome. Given the rarity of NUTM1 fusion-positive B-ALL in adults, this case contributes to the growing evidence that such cases may present with a more aggressive clinical course compared to the pediatric population. Our findings suggest the need for a re-evaluation of therapeutic strategies in adult patients with this subtype of B-ALL.",0
We present a technique for the combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction using the superficial layer quadriceps tendon graft. Anatomic reconstruction is achieved with outside-in femoral tunnel drilling. The femoral drill guide has an intra-articular placement at the femoral footprint of the ACL and an extra-articular placement at the femoral ALL attachment. This surgical technique does not need any special instruments and consists of 3 bone tunnels. The long length and customized superficial quadriceps tendon graft is harvested in a minimally invasive manner and allows an accessible and low-cost reconstruction of both ligaments.,0
"Processing of pears as a fresh-cut product could offer added value and introduce a product into the market that offers greater convenience and health benefits for consumers. Cultivar selection is one of the most important considerations for fresh-cut fruit processing because characteristics such as flesh texture, skin colour, and browning potential can vary greatly among cultivars. Four pear cultivars (‘Flor de invierno’, ‘Passe-Crassane’, ‘Ercolini’ and ‘Conference’) and four antioxidant treatments, that is, (NS) 50 g L-1 NatureSeal® AS1 (Agricoat) solution, (AsAc) 20 g L-1 ascorbic acid + 10 g L-1 citric acid + 10 g L-1 calcium chloride solution, (CaAs) 20 g L-1 calcium ascorbate + 10 g L-1 calcium chloride solution and (NaAs) 20 g L-1 sodium ascorbate + 10 g L-1 calcium chloride solution, were tested to obtain a high-quality fresh-cut pear. For the selected cultivar and treatment, the nutritional changes and physicochemical, microbial and sensorial quality were evaluated under conditions that simulated commercial application followed by storage at 4 °C and a simulated cold chain break at 8°C. The ‘Conference’ pear was selected as the best cultivar based on its physicochemical characteristics (high levels of soluble solids content and low acidity), low increase in browning index, and visual acceptance after 7 days of storage. The results demonstrated that CaAs maintained the fresh-cut pear quality after 8 days of storage at 4°C and also after a cold chain break. Furthermore, application of the selected treatment produced an increase in the ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of minimally processed pear samples. These values were reduced during shelf life, but the total phenolic content at the final sampling point was higher than that of fresh-cut pears after processing without treatment.",1
"Postharvest storage conditions of rowanberry (Sorbus aucuparia) fruits were investigated. The influences of temperature and storage time on total phenolic content were observed. Both variables affected phenolic content of rowanberries, and their total phenolic contents significantly reduced during the 20-day storage at 4 and 22C. The loss of total phenolic was found to be almost 50% of its initial amount (3,619.8 mg/kg fresh weight [fw]) at 22C, which was higher than occurred loss (30%) at 4C. An investigation of rowanberry flavonoids showed the presence of rutin, quercetin-3-glucoside and quercetin-3-D-galactoside (Q3DG). Quantitative analysis of berry flavonoids showed Q3DG as a major compound, being 24.55 mg/kg fw. The highest reduction (86% of its initial amount) was also seen in that compound level compared with other ones. Degradation kinetics of flavonoids was studied at 22C over 16 days of storage. Checking of model adequacies indicated that their reductions followed a first-order kinetic.",1
"Isoflavones are soy phytoestrogens that have been suggested to be anticarcinogenic. Our previous study in premenopausal women suggested that the mechanisms by which isoflavones exert cancer-preventive effects may involve modulation of estrogen metabolism away from production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites [16alpha-(OH) estrone, 4-(OH) estrone, and 4-(OH) estradiol] (X. Xu et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 7: 1101-1108, 1998). To further evaluate this hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone feeding study was performed in 18 healthy postmenopausal women. The study consisted of three diet periods, each separated by a washout of approximately 3 weeks. Each diet period lasted for 93 days, during which subjects consumed their habitual diets supplemented with soy protein isolate providing 0.1 (control), 1, or 2 mg isoflavones/kg body weight/day (7.1 +/- 1.1, 65 +/- 11, or 132 +/- 22 mg/day). A 72-h urine sample was collected 3 days before the study (baseline) and days 91-93 of each diet period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Compared with the soy-free baseline and very low isoflavone control diet, consumption of 65 mg isoflavones increased the urinary 2/16alpha-(OH) estrone ratio, and consumption of 65 or 132 mg isoflavones decreased excretion of 4-(OH) estrone. When compared with baseline values, consumption of all three soy diets increased the ratio of 2/4-(OH) estrogens and decreased the ratio of genotoxic: total estrogens. These data suggest that both isoflavones and other soy constituents may exert cancer-preventive effects in postmenopausal women by altering estrogen metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.",1
"The incorporation of pediatric-inspired regimens in the adolescent-young-adult (AYA) and adult populations have resulted improved survival outcomes (Stock et al. Blood 133(14):1548-1559 2019; Dunsmore et al. J Clin Oncol 38(28):3282-3293 2020; DeAngelo et al. Leukemia 29(3):526-534 2015). Nonetheless incorporation of such regimens is limited by increased toxicity to asparaginase. Dosing strategies that reduce the weight-based dose of pegylated-L-asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) utilizing activity monitoring have been shown to result in better tolerability of these regimens. The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of treating adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) ALL with pediatric-inspired regimens that incorporate PEG-asparaginase dose adjustments and asparaginase activity level monitoring. Patients aged 18-65 years initiated on pediatric-inspired regimens utilizing dose-reduced PEG-asparaginase with therapeutic drug monitoring-guided adjustments were included. The screening of 122 patients treated between 2015 and 2021 resulted in the inclusion of 54 patients. The median age of the cohort was 35 years (16-65 years), and median body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m",0
"Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) extracts have demonstrated potency in scavenging reactive oxygen species that are implicated in many human diseases. We evaluated 33 S. melongena accessions and two S. aethiopicum accessions from the AVRDC Solanum collection for superoxide scavenging (SOS) activity with methanol (SOSm) and water (SOSw) extracts, and contents of total phenolics and ascorbic acid. Highly significant differences were detected among accessions for SOS activities with accession means ranging from 26% to 60% nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction inhibition for SOSm, and 40% to 81% NBT reduction inhibition for SOSw. The SOSm and SOSw produced similar results, evidenced by the highly significant linear correlation (0.79**) between the two assays. Environmental differences between the 2 years influenced expression of SOSm, but the ranking of accessions for SOSm activity was very consistent between years. There was no association between fruit colour and high SOS. Accessions S00062 (white with green stripes), S00022 (light purple and mottled fruit), and S00197 (orange-coloured S. aethiopicum accession) displayed high AOA. The SOSm and SOSw were positively correlated with dry matter content (r=0.65** and r=0.80**, respectively) and total phenolics content (r=0.44** and r=0.43**, respectively) and negatively correlated with fruit weight (r=−0.58** and r=−0.67**, respectively). There was no significant linear association between ascorbic acid content and SOSm (r=0.10) but we found a significant but low correlation (r=0.34*) between SOSw and ascorbic acid content. Accession means for total phenolics content averaged over years ranged from 0.74 to 1.43g/100g dry weight basis, although differences were not statistically significant due to a large accession–year interaction mean square. Sufficient genetic diversity exists in S. melongena for SOS and total phenolics to justify evaluation of a larger number of accessions. High AOA varieties will tend to be small-fruited.",1
"Lenalidomide is an effective component of induction and maintenance therapy for multiple myeloma, though with a risk of secondary malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In contrast to therapy-related myeloid neoplasia, lenalidomide-associated lymphoblastic neoplasia remains poorly characterized. We conducted a dual institution retrospective study of 32 ALL cases that arose after lenalidomide maintenance (all B-lineage, 31/32 BCR::ABL-negative). B-cell ALL (B-ALL) was diagnosed at median 54 months (range, 5-119) after first exposure to lenalidomide and after median 42 months of cumulative lenalidomide exposure (range, 2-114). High incidence of TP53 mutations (9/19 evaluable cases) and low hypodiploidy (8/26 patients) were identified. Despite median age of 65 years and poor-risk B-ALL features observed in the cohort, rates of complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery were high (25/28 patients receiving treatment). Median event-free survival was 35.4 months among treated patients (not reached among those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]). Sixteen patients remain alive without evidence of B-ALL after HCT or extended maintenance therapy. We also describe regression of B-ALL or immature B-cell populations with B-ALL immunophenotype after lenalidomide discontinuation in 5 patients, suggesting lenalidomide may drive leukemic progression even after initiation of lymphoblastic neoplasia and that lenalidomide withdrawal alone may be an appropriate first-line intervention in selected patients. Monitoring for early B-ALL-like proliferations may offer opportunities for lenalidomide withdrawal to prevent progression. Established combination chemotherapy regimens, newer surface antigen-targeted approaches, and allogeneic HCT are effective in many patients with lenalidomide-associated B-ALL and should be offered to medically fit patients.",0
"Genomic analyses have redefined the molecular subgrouping of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Molecular subgroups guide risk-stratification and targeted therapies, but outcomes of recently identified subtypes are often unclear, owing to limited cases with comprehensive profiling and cross-protocol studies. We developed a machine learning tool (ALLIUM) for the molecular subclassification of ALL in retrospective cohorts as well as for up-front diagnostics. ALLIUM uses DNA methylation and gene expression data from 1131 Nordic ALL patients to predict 17 ALL subtypes with high accuracy. ALLIUM was used to revise and verify the molecular subtype of 281 B-cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) cases with previously undefined molecular phenotype, resulting in a single revised subtype for 81.5% of these cases. Our study shows the power of combining DNA methylation and gene expression data for resolving ALL subtypes and provides a comprehensive population-based retrospective cohort study of molecular subtype frequencies in the Nordic countries.",0
"Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) due to the treatment and disease itself. This study presents a serial measurement of the HRQOL of children with ALL during cancer treatment and investigates the impact of demographic, socioeconomic, and medical patient characteristics on their HRQOL. A prospective HRQOL longitudinal study of children with ALL was conducted at an academic hospital between 2016 and 2020. HRQOL was measured using PedsQL 4.0 and PedsQL 3.0 at 3 treatment phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. The HRQOL of children 2 to 18 years of age was assessed using a proxy report, and children 5 to 18 years also reported themselves using patient self-report. The comparison scores between subsequent treatment phases of those interviewed in each time measurement were measured using a repeated measures ANOVA test and a post hoc analysis with the Bonferroni test. One hundred thirteen children 5 to 18 years of age and 221 parents participated. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.6±4.0 years. Children had standard-risk ALL (51%) and were boys (56%). The total score of HRQOL and most subscales significantly improved during treatment. Physical health, school functioning, procedural anxiety, and communication were most affected in early treatment. Although all scores improved over time, school functioning and communication remained lower than other subscales. The age classification impacted the improvement of most HRQOL subscales. In conclusion, the HRQOL improved during treatment. Interventions to maintain physical health and reduce procedural anxiety in early treatment are required. Improving health care providers' communication skills and facilitating hospital schooling will ameliorate HRQOL.",0
"A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.",1
"The work is an attempt at a model presentation, using a new multi-criteria mathematical method called the analytical hierarchy process, of polyphenol supply to human organisms from fruit and vegetables. On this basis, plant raw materials which supply polyphenols to the organism to the greatest extent and thus contribute to an improvement in health state of people in Poland were identified.",1
"We present a case of sirolimus-induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome in a stem cell transplant patient. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. A 24-year-old male with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) underwent testicular extraction followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). He presented with pruritic eczematous lesions, which were initially treated with topical steroids. However, he later developed diffuse xerosis, fever, chills, generalized edema, weight gain, eosinophilia, and leukopenia. Skin biopsy showed spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils, suggesting a drug or atopic reaction. Investigations ruled out infections, and the RegiSCAR score indicated drug reaction syndrome with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive drug, was suspected as the cause. Sirolimus was discontinued, and oral steroids were initiated. After 3 weeks of therapy, the patient showed improvement with resolution of symptoms. Although no cases of sirolimus-induced DRESS syndrome have been reported, allergic reactions with eosinophilia induced by everolimus have been documented. In our case, the patient's history characterized by stem cell transplantation and multiple immunosuppressive therapies may have contributed to the development of DRESS syndrome after beginning sirolimus therapy. This case may be the first evidence of sirolimus-induced DRESS syndrome in a stem cell transplant patient.",0
"Although high-dose, multi-agent chemotherapy has improved leukemia survival rates in recent years, treatment outcomes remain poor in high-risk subsets, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in infants. Development of new, more effective therapies for these patients is therefore an urgent, unmet clinical need. To address this challenge, we developed a nanoscale combination drug formulation that exploits ectopic expression of MERTK tyrosine kinase and dependency on BCL-2 family proteins for leukemia cell survival in pediatric AML and",0
"To study the clinical features and prognosis of high hyperdiploid (HHD) childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A retrospective analysis was performed on the medical data of 1 414 children who were newly diagnosed with ALL and were admitted to five hospitals in Fujian Province of China from April 2011 to December 2020. According to karyotype, they were divided into two groups: HHD ( Among the 1 414 children with ALL, 172 (12.16%) had HHD. Compared with the non-HHD group, the HHD group had significantly lower proportions of children with risk factors for poor prognosis at diagnosis (age of onset ≥10 years or <1 year, white blood cell count ≥50×10 The ALL children with HHD have few risk factors for poor prognosis at diagnosis and often have good prognosis. The number of chromosomes and trisomy of specific chromosomes are associated with prognosis in these children.",0
"Information on late complications in patients with acute leukemia who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is limited. We performed a left-truncated analysis of long-term survival in patients with acute leukemia who were alive and disease-free 2 years after HCT. We included 2701 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 9027 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent HCT between 2005 and 2012. The 10-year overall survival (OS) rate was 81.3% for ALL and 76.2% for AML, with the main causes of late mortality being relapse (ALL-33.9%, AML-44.9%) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (ALL-29%, AML-18%). At 10 years, HCT-related mortality was 16.8% and 20.4%, respectively. Older age and unrelated donor transplantation were associated with a worse prognosis for both types of leukemia. In addition, transplantation in the second or third complete remission and peripheral blood HSC for ALL are associated with worse outcomes. Similarly, adverse cytogenetics, female donor to male patient combination, and reduced intensity conditioning in AML contribute to poor prognosis. We conclude that 2-year survival in remission after HCT for acute leukemia is encouraging, with OS of nearly 80% at 10 years. However, the long-term mortality risk of HCT survivors remains significantly higher than that of the age-matched general population. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring transplantation strategies to improve long-term outcomes in patients with acute leukemia undergoing HCT.",0
"The effect of processing on functional compounds in buckwheat was investigated. Extractions of buckwheat flour were carried out before and after roasting or extrusion. Folin–Ciocalteu assays indicated that processing did not cause any change in total phenolic content in buckwheat flour. Roasted (200°C, 10min) dark buckwheat flour exhibited an increase in non-polar compounds as well as polar compounds whereas extrusion exhibited increase only in polar compounds. Antioxidant activity test (DPPH) showed that roasting at 200°C for 10min decreased the antioxidant activity slightly whereas extrusion (170°C) did not cause any change. The results suggest that processing conditions can be optimized to retain the health promoting compounds in buckwheat products.",1
"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been a cornerstone of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment for decades, with significant improvements in patient survival. These advancements are linked to better therapies, refined conditioning regimens, and minimal residual disease monitoring. Despite progress, challenges remain in reducing relapse, treatment-related mortality, and toxicity. This article explores recent advancements in ASCT for ALL, focusing on conditioning regimens, graft engineering, and post-transplant therapies. Key developments include identifying patients who benefit from reduced-intensity conditioning over myeloablative conditioning or reduction in dose of total body irradiation (TBI), leading to improved outcomes and lower toxicity. Innovative graft manipulation strategies, such as Orca-T and Orca-Q, aim to enhance graft-versus-leukemia effects while minimizing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Additionally, post-transplant therapies, including targeted treatments, immunotherapies, and CAR-T cells, are showing promise in preventing relapse. Advances in mismatched donor use and GVHD prophylaxis are broadening donor options and reducing adverse effects, improving ASCT's safety and effectiveness in ALL. ASCT remains a critical treatment for high-risk ALL, with advancements in conditioning, graft engineering, and post-transplant strategies. Future focus will be on optimizing patient selection, use in post-CAR-T consolidation, and refining graft manipulation, aiming to personalize ASCT and enhance survival and quality of life for ALL patients.",0
"BackgroundIn acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), pegaspargase is included in the backbone of numerous chemotherapy regimens. Treatment-related toxicities can be substantial, often resulting in treatment delays, dose reductions, or early discontinuation. This study aimed to evaluate whether differences in efficacy, safety, and economic outcomes exist between standard dosing and modified approaches involving dose-reduced and delayed administration of pegaspargase.MethodsThis retrospective, single-center study evaluated hospitalized adult patients who received pegaspargase as part of CALGB 10403 induction course I. Patients were stratified into two groups: 1) full pegaspargase dose 2500 units/m",0
"Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human health.",1
"The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid (GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.",1
"We determined whether nine common herbs (basil, chili, cilantro, dill, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, oregano, and parsley) and one herb mixture (Italian Herbs) retain the antioxidant capacity (AC) and content of phenolics and characteristic marker compounds during processing to dry and paste forms. Oregano exhibited the highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.",1
"The prognostic impact of PICALM::MLLT10 status in childhood leukaemia is not well described. Ten International Berlin Frankfurt Münster-affiliated study groups and the Children's Oncology Group collaborated in this multicentre retrospective study. The presence of the PICALM::MLLT10 fusion gene was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or RNA sequencing at participating sites. Ninety-eight children met the study criteria. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) predominated 55 (56%) and 39 (40%) patients, respectively. Most patients received a chemotherapy regimen per their disease phenotype: 58% received an ALL regimen, 40% an AML regimen and 1% a hybrid regimen. Outcomes for children with PICALM::MLLT10 ALL were reasonable: 5-year event-free survival (EFS) 67% and 5-year overall survival (OS) 76%, but children with PICALM::MLLT10 AML had poor outcomes: 5-year EFS 22% and 5-year OS 26%. Haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) did not result in a significant improvement in outcomes for PICALM::MLLT10 AML: 5-year EFS 20% for those who received HSCT versus 23% for those who did not (p = 0.6) and 5-year OS 37% versus 36% (p = 0.7). In summary, this study confirms that PICALM::MLLT10 AML is associated with a dismal prognosis and patients cannot be salvaged with HSCT; exploration of novel therapeutic options is warranted.",0
"Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, including coumestrol, were identified. The database will improve phytoestrogen intake estimation in future epidemiological and clinical studies particularly in Western populations.",1
"Genetic alterations play a pivotal role in leukemic clonal transformation, significantly influencing disease pathogenesis and clinical outcomes. Here, we report a novel fusion gene and investigate its pathogenic role in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We engineer a transposon transfection system expressing the TOP2B::AFF2 transcript and introduce it into Ba/F3 cells. Functional studies, including proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays, were conducted to assess the fusion gene's impact. In vitro assays reveal that the TOP2B::AFF2 fusion significantly enhances Ba/F3 cell proliferation and G1/S phase transition while suppressing differentiation and apoptosis. This study identifies TOP2B::AFF2 as a potential oncogenic driver. However, further validation through in vivo studies are warranted to fully elucidate the fusion gene's role in leukemogenesis.",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive type of leukemia caused by accumulation of multiple genetic alterations in T-cell progenitors. However, for many genes it remains unknown how their mutations contribute to disease development. We therefore performed two single-cell CRISPR screens in primary pro-T cells ex vivo to study the transcriptional impact of loss-of-function alterations in T-ALL and correlate this with effects on cell fitness. The various perturbations were clustered based on their effects on E2F/MYC or STAT/NOTCH signatures, which play a defining role in driving T-cell proliferation. Many of the perturbations resulted in positive effects on the STAT and NOTCH signatures and were predicted to behave as haploinsufficient tumor suppressors in T-ALL. Additionally, Spi1 was identified as an essential gene for pro-T-cell survival, associated with deregulation of the MYC signature and epigenetic consequences. In contrast, Bcl11b was identified as a strong tumor suppressor gene in immature T lymphocytes, associated with deregulation of NF-kB and JAK/STAT signaling. We found a correlation between BCL11B expression level and JAK/STAT pathway mutations in T-ALL patients and demonstrated oncogenic cooperation between Bcl11b inactivation and JAK3 hyperactivation in pro-T cells. Altogether, these single-cell CRISPR screens in pro-T cells provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional deregulation caused by genetic alterations in T-ALL.",0
"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis, but a decisive marker and effective treatment for leukaemia stem cells (LSCs) remain unclear. Here, using lineage tracing, limiting dilution assays and in vivo live imaging approaches, we identify rare inhibitory receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)-expressing cells that reside at the apex of leukaemia hierarchy for initiation and relapse in T-ALL. Ablation of PD-1-expressing cells, deletion of PD-1 in T-ALL cells or blockade of PD-1 or PD-1 ligand 1 significantly eradicated LSCs and suppressed disease progression. Combination therapy using PD-1 blockade and chemotherapy substantially extended the survival of mice engrafted with mouse or human T-ALL cells. Mechanistically, PD-1",0
"The phenolic compounds present in 29 samples of olive fruits were analysed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and/or HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS/MS. All samples were collected during the normal picking period for olive oil production, in north and central Portugal, and were obtained from 18 different olive cultivars. Two different extraction methods were necessary for the complete quantification of phenolic compounds, a methanolic extraction and an extraction which included a solid-phase extraction (SPE) cleaning step. The analyses showed that all samples presented a similar profile, which included at least six identified phenolic compounds: hydroxytyrosol, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, oleuropein, rutin, apigenin 7-O-glucoside and luteolin. Several samples also contained 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, verbascoside, quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside. In all samples, hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein were the major compounds identified while, in general, rutin and luteolin 7-O-glucoside were the two main flavonoids. The influences of maturation index, nature of the cultivar and geographical origin are discussed.",1
"Purpose: Resveratrol, a phenolic phytoalexin occurring in grapes, wine, peanuts, and cranberries, has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, phytoestrogenic, and cardioprotective activities. Because little is known about the metabolism of this potentially important compound, the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of trans-resveratrol were investigated. Methods: The in vitro experiments included incubation with human liver microsomes, human hepatocytes, and rat hepatocytes and the in vivo studies included oral or intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol to rats and mice. Methanol extracts of rat urine, mouse serum, human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, and human liver microsomes were analyzed for resveratrol metabolites using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line ultraviolet-photodiode array detection and mass spectrometric detection (LC-DAD-MS and LC-UV-MS-MS). UV-photodiode array analysis facilitated the identification of cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol and its metabolites. Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometric analysis provided molecular weight confirmation of resveratrol metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry allowed structural information to be obtained. Results: No resveratrol metabolites were detected in the microsomal incubations, and no phase I metabolites, such as oxidations, reductions, or hydrolyzes, were observed in any samples. However, abundant trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate were identified in rat urine, mouse serum, and incubations with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase to release free resveratrol was used to confirm the structures of these conjugates. Only trace amounts of cis-resveratrol were detected, indicating that isomerization was not an important factor in the metabolism and elimination of resveratrol. Conclusion: Our results indicate that trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate are the most abundant metabolites of resveratrol. Virtually no unconjugated resveratrol was detected in urine or serum samples, which might have implications regarding the significance of in vitro studies that used only unconjugated resveratrol.",1
"Cytokine-induced memory-like natural killer cells (CIMLNK) represent a novel form of adoptive cellular therapy that is easy to manufacture and readily available. These cells are generated after overnight stimulation of purified natural killer (NK) cells with interleukin-12 (IL-12), interleukin-15 (IL-15), and interleukin-18 (IL-18). While CIMLNK has demonstrated efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML), its potential application in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains unclear. Tafasitamab (TAFA), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against CD19, a surface antigen expressed on B-ALL cells, has been developed to augment anti-tumor efficacy through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a mechanism predominantly mediated by NK cells. Consequently, we sought to assess the susceptibility of B-ALL to the combination of CIMLNK and TAFA using three B-ALL cell lines: NALM6, SUP-B15, and RS4;11. The addition of TAFA significantly augmented the cytotoxic activity, degranulation capacity, and IFN-γ production of CIMLNK. TAFA-induced ADCC was found to be dose-dependent and was abolished after CD16 blockade. Furthermore, TAFA-mediated effects against NALM6 and SUP-B15 were more pronounced in CIMLNK compared to unstimulated NK cells. In vivo, the combination of CIMLNK and TAFA led to a more pronounced survival benefit in leukemia-bearing mice. In summary, our findings suggest that this combination holds promise as a potential alternative treatment option for patients with relapsed refractory B-ALL.",0
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-cell ALL) is a common haematologic cancer in children and adults. About 10 percent of children and 50 percent of adults fail to achieve a histological complete remission or subsequently relapse despite current anti-leukaemia drug therapies and/or haematopoietic cell transplants. Several new immune therapies including monoclonal antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cells are proved safe and effective in this setting. We review data on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immune therapies for B-cell ALL in children and adults including blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, tisagenlecleucel, and brexucabtagene autoleucel. We also summarize pharmaco-dynamics, pharmaco-kinetics, and pharmaco-economics of these interventions.",0
"This study aims to investigate the role of excessive Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-Receptor Type 21 (PTPN21) in the proliferation of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) cells with EGF stimulation. PTPN21 was overexpressed in ALL cell lines by lentiviral transfection. Apoptosis was assayed by Annexin V/7-AAD staining. The proliferation and cell cycle of EGF-treated ALL cells were assessed by MTT and Ki-67/7-AAD staining respectively. The phosphorylation of Src tyrosine kinase and mediators of distinct MAPK pathways were assessed by Western blot. Overexpression of PTPN21 had minimal effect on the apoptosis of ALL cells, but significantly promoted the proliferation and cell cycle progression of ALL cells stimulated with EGF. The activity of Src tyrosine kinase and the MAPK pathways was elevated. Inhibition of MAPK pathways by specific inhibitors mitigated this pro-proliferative effect of excessive PTPN21 on EGF-stimulated ALL cells. PTPN21 may facilitate ALL progression by promoting cell proliferation via the Src/MAPK signaling pathways.",0
"In this study, the influences of processing and pasteurization on color values and total phenolic compounds of pomegranate juices were investigated. Pomegranate juices were produced by different clarification techniques (conventional fining, conventional fining together with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone [PVPP], ultrafiltration). Nonclarified juice was also produced as control. Clarification methods, heat treatments and methods and heat treatments together significantly (P < 0.05) affected the color values of pomegranate juices. Moreover, conventional fining together with PVPP treatment was found to be the most effective method to remove phenolic compounds.",1
"Genomic instability is one of the main drivers of tumorigenesis and the development of hematological malignancies. Cancer cells can remedy chemotherapeutic-induced DNA damage by upregulating DNA-repair genes and ultimately inducing therapy resistance. Nevertheless, the association between the DNA-repair genes, drug resistance, and disease relapse has not been well characterized in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study aimed to explore the role of the DNA-repair machinery and the molecular mechanisms by which it is regulated in early- and late-relapsing pediatric ALL patients. We performed secondary data analysis on the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)-ALL expansion phase II trial of 198 relapsed pediatric precursor B-cell ALL. Comprehensive genetic and epigenetic investigations of 147 DNA-repair genes were conducted in the study. Gene expression was assessed using Microarray and RNA-sequencing platforms. Genomic alternations, methylation status, and miRNA transcriptome were investigated for the candidate DNA-repair genes. We identified three DNA-repair genes,",0
"Rye grain was roller milled into six flour fractions (607 g kg‐1), a short (341 g kg‐1) and a bran (52 g kg‐1) in a Bühler laboratory mill. In the different flours (F1–F6) a progressive increase in ash (4–13 g kg‐1), crude protein (39–87 g kg‐1) and crude fat (5–17 g kg‐1) concentration was found and a corresponding decrease in starch (853–699 g kg‐1) concentration. Total dietary fibre (55–109 g kg‐1) constituents and the lignans, matairesinol (0·05–0·22 mg kg‐1) and secoisolariciresinol (0·21–0·38 mg kg‐1), showed a different distribution with a maximal concentration in F5. The short and bran had higher concentrations of ash, crude protein, crude fat, dietary fibre components and lignans but a lower concentration of starch than the flours. Compared to the short, the bran contained more of all constituents analysed except mixed‐linked β‐glucan and starch. A very high proportion of total dietary fibre components of the rye, such as arabinoxylan (72%), cellulose (76%) and Klason lignin (79%) as well as of matairesinol (87%) and secoisolariciresinol (73%), was found in the short and bran together.",1
"Sixteen sorghum varieties widely cultivated in Zimbabwe were examined for levels of phenolic compounds and kernel characteristics, to help identify those with desirable properties and develop suitable processing methods. Assays for polyphenols included the chlorox test, the vanillin-HCl, the ferric ammonium citrate and the butanol-HCl methods. Free phenolic acids were analysed using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Varieties DC-75, Mutode and Chirmaugute had the highest levels of condensed tannins. The polyphenols in Chibonda were mostly unextractable in methanol. No significant levels of polyphenols were found in 13 varieties. Phenolic acid content was related to pericarp colour. Endosperm texture and pericarp thickness were evaluated using video image analysis. Katandanzara and SV1 had relatively corneous endosperms (<30% floury). Mutode, Chibonda and DC-75 had thick pericarps (>0.060 mm). Endosperm texture was not correlated with phenolic compounds. A positive correlation, however, was observed between pericarp thickness and polyphenol content (r > 0.64). Zimbabwean sorghums lack ideal agronomic and processing physico-chemical characteristics defined in terms of high polyphenols, plus hard endosperm and thin pericarp. Research is required to develop effective methods to process the available polyphenol-rich sorghums.",1
"Four trichothecene-producing strains of Fusarium graminearum were grown on three maize grain fractions, whole grain, degermed grain, and the germ, to determine the effect of natural substrates on mycotoxin production. Monitoring the ergosterol content after 25 days of incubation indicated that fungal growth on all grain fractions was comparable. Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.",1
"Violet cauliflower and red cabbage were analysed for their anthocyanin profiles before and after thermal treatments. Anthocyanins are well-noted as healthy compounds due to their antioxidant properties. Samples were analysed for total anthocyanin content by using a spectrophotometric differential pH method. An MS-based method, combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) was developed, aimed to separate, identify and quantify the main anthocyanin forms. The procedure involves a rapid and efficient pre-treatment of the samples by solid-phase extraction, followed by selective determination of all compounds in a single run analysis using HPLC–MS/MS. Structural information for the identification of compounds was obtained from their fragmentation patterns (MS/MS spectra). The compounds were separated by HPLC and detected in the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM), which provides a high level of selectivity for targeting the analytes in vegetables. Cauliflower and red cabbage showed differences in their anthocyanin profiles: cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside was absent in cauliflower, while it was well represented in red cabbage, together with the characteristic anthocyanin of Brassica genus, cyanidin-3-sophoroside-5-glucoside. The p-coumaryl and feruloyl esterified forms of cyanidin-3-sophoroside-5-glucoside were predominant in cauliflower, while the sinapyl one was mostly present in red cabbage. Besides, the stability of cauliflower’s anthocyanin profile was evaluated in relation to thermal pre-treatments. All thermal treatments, except microwave heating, drastically reduced total cauliflower anthocyanin content. The amount of individual anthocyanins was expressed as the percentage with respect to total anthocyanin amount, spectrophotometrically measured. Significant individual changes were observed after different thermal treatment with an isomer formation.",1
"Tea drinking is associated with an improved antioxidant status in vivo which may contribute to the lowering of the risk of certain types of cancer, coronary heart disease and stroke. The polyphenolic bioactive composition and the antioxidant properties of Mauritian commercial black and fresh tea leaves were evaluated. Hot water infusates contained high levels of total phenols, total proanthocyanidins and total flavonoids. The concentrations of individual compounds, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, (−)-epicatechin 3-gallate, epigallocatechin, (−)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate, gallic acid, and procyanidin dimers B1 and B2 were high. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays were used to assess the antioxidant potential of tea infusates with the following order of potency: Ouvagalia tea>Buccaneer’s choice>Black Label>Red Label>Extra>Corson>Chartreuse>La Flora>3-Pavillons. Linear regression analyses indicated high correlation coefficient with total proanthocyanidin (TEAC r=0.96 and FRAP r=0.95) and total phenol contents (TEAC r=0.90 and FRAP r=0.92) in infusates. Catechins and gallic acid significantly contributed to the overall antioxidant capacity of black tea extracts. In general, the fresh tea leaves had high levels of total phenols, total flavonoids, total proanthocyanidin and exhibited greater antioxidant potentials when compared with black teas. Thus Mauritian black teas and fresh tea leaves can be rich sources of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidants, which may be highly relevant to the maintenance of normal health and disease management, an observation that has led to the commencement of a clinical trial study to assess cardiovascular health in Mauritius.",1
"A rapid and sensitive method has been developed for the determination of trans-resveratrol in wine. This method consists of a solid phase extraction step followed by a rapid HPLC quantification step (30 min). The improvement of this method consists of the washing step of the solid phase extraction method carried out at pH 8.0 (12% ethanol in a phosphate buffer solution), thus permitting a more efficient removal of the interfering phenolic compounds in conjunction with the required low volume of tested sample. Trans-resveratrol content was determined for 29 red Greek wines of appellation of origin. The concentrations found varied between 0.550 and 2.534 mg/l. The wines produced by grape varieties grown in the Greek islands (Rhodes, Crete and Paros) were richer in trans-resveratrol. The grape variety Mandilaria, in particular, was the Greek variety with the highest trans-resveratrol content.",1
"Green leafy vegetable extracts of six genotypes of kale (Brassica oleracea acephala) were evaluated for ascorbic acid, carotenoids, total phenolics and antioxidant activity. Ascorbic acid ranged from 142 mg per 100 g in Wappal Hakh to 164 mg per 100 g fr wt in Knol khol. Wild genotypes Wappal and Pumb, had significantly high phenolic content (285 and 227 mg per 100 g fr wt) and possessed highest antioxidant activities (840 and 780 µmol FRAP per g fr wt) than cultivated genotypes. A positive and strong correlation (R2 = 0.807) between total phenolic content and antioxidant activity suggests that kale has enormous potential to enhance the antioxidant potential of our daily food supply. Wild genotypes, Wappal and Pumb can be incorporated into the breeding programmes in order to increase the antioxidant potential of cultivated varieties.",1
"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a common childhood blood cancer. Human Parvovirus B19 (PV-B19) mainly replicates in bone marrow erythroblasts and can persist long after initial infection. ALL patients frequently exhibit PV-B19 viremia, arising from either viral reactivation or coincidental infection amid acute leukemia.  Aims of the Study: This study aimed to determine the prevalence PV-B19 infection in ALL patients, investigate its association with hematological parameters at presentation, and monitor these parameters and disease progression in relation to PV-B19 infection. This case-control study included 30 newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and 30 healthy blood donors as controls. Patients' data were collected through interviews or records. Plasma levels of anti-PV-B19 IgG and IgM antibodies were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and viral DNA quantification was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The IgG and IgM prevalence in patients was 36.67% and 3.33%, respectively, compared to 33.33% and 0% in controls. The molecular assay revealed 63.33% of patients were PV-B19 DNA positive, significantly higher than the 6.67% in controls. Patients had a significantly higher mean log10 viral load (5.17±1.39 copies/ml) than controls (2.64± 0.28 copies/ml) (P= 0.019). PV-B19 had no significant association with hematological parameters before chemotherapy; however, after chemotherapy, viral infection was significantly associated with reduced chemotherapy response and increased blood transfusion rate. PV-B19 infection seems to have more pronounce role in ALL after treatment initiation, where it associates with increased rate of blood transfusion and reduced response to chemotherapy. Therefore, PV-B19 should be considered in acute leukemia patients.",0
"The antioxidative substances contained in cacao liquor, which is one of the major ingredients of chocolate, were separated by column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Three major compounds were purified and two of them were identified by 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectra as (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (CA). Their antioxidative activity was measured by monitoring the peroxide value of linoleic acid and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance values of erythrocyte ghost membranes and microsomes. EC and CA had strong antioxidative effects in all three methods, but one unidentified peak was found to be less effective. Additionally, we analyzed the polyphenol concentration of cacao liquor extractions produced in several countries. The total polyphenol concentration was 7.0 to 13.0%, catechin concentration was 0.31 to 0.49%, and epicatechin concentration was 0.35 to 1.68% in the extractions. It is believed that chocolate is stable against oxidative deterioration on account of the presence of these polyphenolic compounds, and it is also expected to have a protective role against lipid peroxidation in living systems.",1
"Third-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells (CARTs) might improve clinical outcome of patients with B cell malignancies. This is the first report on a third-generation CART dose-escalating, phase-1/2 investigator-initiated trial treating adult patients with refractory and/or relapsed (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thirteen patients were treated with escalating doses of CD19-directed CARTs between 1 × 10 For all patients, CART manufacturing was feasible. None of the patients developed any grade of Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) or a higher-grade (≥ grade III) catokine release syndrome (CRS). CART expansion and long-term CART persistence were evident in the peripheral blood (PB) of evaluable patients. At end of study on day 90 after CARTs, ten patients were evaluable for response: Eight patients (80%) achieved a complete remission (CR), including five patients (50%) with minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR. Response and outcome were associated with the administered CART dose. At 1-year follow-up, median overall survival was not reached and progression-free survival (PFS) was 38%. Median PFS was reached on day 120. Lack of CD39-expression on memory-like T cells was more frequent in CART products of responders when compared to CART products of non-responders. After CART administration, higher CD8 + and γδ-T cell frequencies, a physiological pattern of immune cells and lower monocyte counts in the PB were associated with response. In conclusion, third-generation CARTs were associated with promising clinical efficacy and remarkably low procedure-specific toxicity, thereby opening new therapeutic perspectives for patients with r/r ALL.

"Liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS) with positive and negative ion detection was used for the identification of flavonoids in Hakmeitau beans, a black seed cultivar of cowpea (Vigna sinensis). Gradient elution with water and acetonitrile, both containing 2% formic acid, was employed in chromatographic separation. The peaks were identified by comparison of the retention times and the UV-vis spectroscopic and mass spectrometric data with authentic standards and/or literature data. The identified flavonoids included six anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, cyanidin 3-O-glucoside, delphinidin 3-O-glucoside, malvidin 3-O-glucoside, peonidin 3-O-glucoside, and petunidin 3-O-glucoside) and four flavonol/flavonol glycosides (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-6' '-acetylglucoside). The tentatively identified flavonoids included two anthocyanins (malvidin 3-O-acetylglucoside and peonidin 3-O-malonylglucoside) and three flavonol glycosides (myricetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin 7-O-glucoside, and quercetin-3-O-diglucoside). These flavonoids are present in seed coats, and the contents of anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides were 20.7 and 2.0 mg/g, respectively.",1

"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is one of the most valuable independent prognostic factors in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Bone marrow (BM) aspiration, however, is an invasive process. Previous studies have shown that microRNAs (miR) and extracellular vesicle (EV)-related miRs show different expression profiles at the presence of malignant cells compared to healthy controls. In our previous project, we have reported that two miRs previously described to be overexpressed in blasts were significantly decreased over the first week of the therapy of patients with ALL in the platelet free plasma fraction (PFP) of peripheral blood samples (PB). The aim of the current study was to assess the relation between day 15 flow cytometry (FC) MRD and expression of miR-128-3p and miR-222-3p miRs in exosome-enriched fraction (EEF) of PFP to evaluate whether their expression in EEF correlates with day 15 FC MRD more precisely. PB was collected from 13 patients diagnosed with pediatric pre-B ALL at 4 time points. Expression of miR-128-3p and miR-222-3p was measured by qPCR in PFP and EEF. Positive correlation was found between changes of miR-128-3p expression in EEF or PFP by day 8 of chemotherapy and day 15 FC MRD (r Our results show that circulating miRs are potential biomarkers of ALL MRD, asmiR-128-3p level both in PFP and EEF predicts day 15 FC MRD. In addition, the assessment of the EEF gave a more promising result.",0
"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a life-threatening malignancy characterized by its aggressive progression and detrimental effects on the hematopoietic system. Early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to optimizing therapeutic interventions and improving clinical outcomes. This study introduces a novel diagnostic framework that synergizes the EfficientNet-B7 architecture with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies to address challenges in performance, computational efficiency, and explainability. The proposed model achieves improved diagnostic performance, with accuracies exceeding 96% on the Taleqani Hospital dataset and 95.50% on the C-NMC-19 and Multi-Cancer datasets. Rigorous evaluation across multiple metrics-including Area Under the Curve (AUC), mean Average Precision (mAP), Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score-demonstrates the model's robustness and establishes its superiority over state-of-the-art architectures namely VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, DenseNet50 and AlexNet . Furthermore, the framework significantly reduces computational overhead, achieving up to 40% faster inference times, thereby enhancing its clinical applicability. To address the opacity inherent in Deep learning (DL) models, the framework integrates advanced XAI techniques, including Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Class Activation Mapping (CAM), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Integrated Gradients (IG), providing transparent and explainable insights into model predictions. This fusion of high diagnostic precision, computational efficiency, and explainability positions the proposed framework as a transformative tool for ALL diagnosis, bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and practical clinical deployment.",0
"In the phase 3 ponatinib-3001 trial (PhALLCON, NCT03589326), ponatinib demonstrated superior efficacy over imatinib with comparable safety in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). This post hoc analysis evaluated the net benefits of ponatinib using a quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or toxicity (Q-TWiST) approach. Overall survival (OS) time for patients from PhALLCON was partitioned into three health states: TOX (time with grade 3+ treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs] before disease progression), TWiST (time without toxicity before progression), and REL (time from progression until death or end of follow-up). Q-TWiST was calculated as the sum of health utility-weighted restricted mean durations of the three states. A relative Q-TWiST gain of ≥ 10% was considered clinically important. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying TOX and REL utilities, follow-up time, and the TOX definition (using grade 2+ TEAEs or patient-perceived treatment tolerability assessed by the FACT-GP5). Among all randomized patients (ponatinib n = 164, imatinib n = 81), restricted mean OS was similar between arms (1082.2 vs. 1024.8 days; p = 0.373). In the base-case analysis, mean TWiST was 214.5 days longer with ponatinib versus imatinib (95% CI 70.3-358.7; p = 0.004), REL was shorter by 175.9 days (325.4-26.5; p = 0.021), and TOX was not significantly different between arms (p = 0.228). The relative Q-TWiST gain (10.98%) was clinically important. Sensitivity analyses consistently supported the robustness of the base-case findings. Ponatinib may prolong quality-adjusted survival compared with imatinib, supporting the benefit-risk profile of ponatinib as a front-line treatment for Ph+ ALL. NCT03589326.",0
"The effects of soaking, boiling, and steaming processes on the phenolic components and antioxidant activity of black beans were investigated. All processed beans exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower antioxidant activities than raw beans in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). Steaming processes resulted in a greater retention of TPC and ORAC values than the boiling processes. Pressure boiling shortened processing time compared to regular boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, but significantly increased in ORAC as compared to the regular boiling method. Pressure steaming resulted in significant decreases in TPC, DPPH, while significantly increased in ORAC compared to regular steaming. Greater TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values were detected in boiling water than in the soaking and steaming water. Mass balance analysis showed that boiling caused more dry solid loss than steaming. All of these results indicated that processing methods significantly changed contents and activities of antioxidant components of black beans. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in appearance and texture of the cooked product, shortening processing time, and in greater retention of TPC and antioxidant activities. Steam processing may be used to develop high-quality health-promoting black bean products.",1
"The acid hydrolysis method was applied for analyzing flavonoid aglycones in Angelica keiskei. The experiment examined the leaves and stalks of the plant separately. HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) with diode array detection was used to identify of five major flavonoids; quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, luteolin and apigenin. Quercetin and luteolin were found in the leaves, and only quercetin was found in the stalk. The hydrolysis conditions of the two flavonoid aglycones in the leaves were optimized by varying acid concentrations and reaction periods. The range of each parent flavonoid content was determined by optimized hydrolysis conditions. The samples were harvested from two areas of Korea between February and August 2002. Quercetin content was 90 mg at the lowest and 809 mg at the highest per kg of fresh leaves. The content of luteolin ranged between 82 mg and 579 mg per kg of fresh leaves. The quercetin content in the stalk was much lower than in the leaves, and luteolin was not detected in the stalk. The correlation between flavonoid content and sunshine durations was also presented.",1
"While the prognostic role of immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH) rearrangement in minimal residual disease (MRD) in pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) has been reported, the contribution of light chain loci (IGK/IGL) remains elusive. This study is to evaluate the prognosis of IGH and IGK/IGL rearrangement-based MRD detected by next-generation sequencing in B-ALL at the end of induction (EOI) and end of consolidation (EOC). IGK/IGL rearrangements identify 5.5% of patients without trackable IGH clones. Concordance rates for IGH and IGK/IGL are 79.9% (cutoff 0.01%) at EOI and 81.0% (cutoff 0.0001%) at EOC, respectively. Patients with NGS-MRD < 0.01% at EOI or <0.0001% at EOC present excellent outcome, with 3-year event-free survival rates higher than 95%. IGH-MRD is prognostic at EOI/EOC, while IGK-MRD at EOI/EOC and IGL-MRD at EOI are not. At EOI, NGS identifies 26.2% of higher risk patients whose MRD < 0.01% by flow cytometry. However, analyzing IGK/IGL along with IGH fails to identify additional higher risk patients both at EOI and at EOC. In conclusion, IGH is crucial for MRD monitoring while IGK and IGL have relatively limited value.",0
"Risk stratification is crucial to the successful treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although numerous risk factors have been identified, an optimal prognostic model for integrating variables has not been developed. We used individual patient data from 4 contemporary academic national clinical trials, UKALL14, NILG-ALL10/07, GIMEMA-LAL1913, and PETHEMA-ALL-HR2011, to generate and validate the European Working Group for Adult ALL prognostic index (EWALL-PI), which is based on white blood cell count, genetics, and end of induction minimal residual disease (MRD). Individual patient risk scores were calculated for 778 patients aged 15 to 67 years in complete remission using the validated UKALL-PI formula, applying minor modifications to reflect differences between pediatric and adult ALL. Per-trial analysis revealed that EWALL-PI correlated with relapse and death. Regression analysis revealed that each unit increase in EWALL-PI increased the risk of relapse or death by ∼30% with no evidence of heterogeneity across trials or patient subgroups. EWALL-PI-defined risk models outperformed the stratification algorithms used by each trial. Threshold analysis revealed an EWALL-PI threshold that divided patients with B cell and T cell into standard (EWALL-PI <2.50) and high (EWALL-PI ≥2.50) risk groups, respectively. Per-trial analysis showed that patients at high risk had a significantly increased relapse rate and inferior survival compared with patients with standard risk (subdistribution hazard ratio for relapse, ranged from 1.85 to 3.28; hazard ratio for death, 1.73 to 3.03). Subgroup analysis confirmed the robustness of these risk groups by sex, age, white blood cell count, and lineage. In conclusion, we validated an integrated risk model across 4 independent adult ALL clinical trials, demonstrating its utility defining clinically relevant risk groups.",0
"Due to the lack of one universally applicable and commonly used reference method, sample preparation in isoflavone (IF) analysis has been performed by many different methods which renders comparison and quality assessment of published IF contents in foodstuffs difficult. In the present work, the impact of different experimental parameters on the IF concentrations determined in soybeans, tofu, soy drink and textured vegetable protein by different extraction and hydrolysis methods was assessed and IF contents obtained by optimized orthogonal methods were compared. Chromatographic analysis was performed by HPLC-UV-ESI-MS. If possible sources of error - which are also pointed out in this work - are avoided, IF contents obtained by extraction, acid-, base- and enzymatic hydrolysis are similar. However, these sample preparation methods differ in the amount of time, standard compounds and instruments required, ruggedness, and in their applicability to analysis of complex composite samples containing soy as minor ingredient. Enzymatic hydrolysis with Helix pomatia juice after extraction by sonication with first 50, then 80% aqueous acetonitrile in the presence of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and after adjustment to </=10% organic solvent turned out to be the method of choice if only aglucone equivalent contents are required. The advantages of this method are short chromatographic run times, smallest danger of coelution, lowest achievable limits of quantitation and therefore best suitability for work-up of complex composite samples and that only aglucone standards are needed for quantitation.",1
"The iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages was determined by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The influence on FRAP due to the degree of roasting (light, medium, and dark), species (Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta), and caffeine content (regular and decaffeinated) was investigated using ground and soluble coffee samples. The concentration of specific chlorogenic acids and caffeine in the beverages was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and related to FRAP using Pearson correlation coefficients. All measurements were expressed per unit of soluble solids. Beverages prepared with ground coffee had, on average, 27% higher FRAP values than those prepared with soluble coffee (p < 0.05). In the former beverages, FRAP of C. robusta samples was significantly higher (on average, 50.3%) when compared to that of C. arabica samples, and FRAP values decreased with increasing degree of roasting (p < 0.05). A strong correlation (r > 0.91) was found between FRAP and the total content of chlorogenic acids, particularly that of the caffeoylquinic acid isomers. The iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages was not influenced by caffeine.",1
"The oxidative stability and minor constituents of three cold-pressed low erucic acid rapeseed oils and three virgin olive oils were compared. The rapeseed oils were more easily oxidized, in part due to their higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The rapeseed oils were rich in γ-tocopherol and had low initial peroxide values (PVs), but their hydrophilic phenol content was low, only 3–4 ppm. Olive oils contained α-tocopherol and 40–100 times more hydrophilic phenols compared to the rapeseed oils. The initial PVs of fresh olive oils were much higher than those of rapeseed oils. Lutein and β-carotene were present in all oils but chlorophylls (pheophytin a) only in the olive oils. The phenolic extract from the olive oils protected both bulk and emulsified methyl linoleate (MeLo) from oxidation at the 100 ppm level. The extracts obtained from the rapeseed oils had either moderate or no antioxidative effect in MeLo. Testing of the extracts for their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity yielded similar results. We conclude that phenolic compounds contribute significantly to the oxidative stability of cold-pressed oils.",1
"Alterations of FLT3 are among the most common driver events in acute leukaemia with important clinical implications, since it allows patient classification into prognostic groups and the possibility of personalising therapy thanks to the availability of FLT3 inhibitors. Most of the knowledge on FLT3 implications comes from the study of acute myeloid leukaemia and so far, few studies have been performed in other leukaemias. A comprehensive genomic (DNA-seq in 267 patients) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq in 160 patients) analysis of FLT3 in 342 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients was performed. Mutations were functionally characterised by in vitro experiments. Point mutations (PM) and internal tandem duplications (ITD) were detected in 4.3% and 2.7% of the patients, respectively. A new activating mutation of the TKD, G846D, conferred oncogenic properties and sorafenib resistance. Moreover, a novel alteration involving the circularisation of read-through transcripts (rt-circRNAs) was observed in 10% of the cases. Patients presenting FLT3 alterations exhibited higher levels of the receptor. In addition, patients with ZNF384- and MLL/KMT2A-rearranged ALL, as well as hyperdiploid subtype, overexpressed FLT3. Our results suggest that specific ALL subgroups may also benefit from a deeper understanding of the biology of FLT3 alterations and their clinical implications.",0
"A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid (FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites (sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.",1
"Some leafy vegetables were studied for their nutritional composition, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. The aerial parts of Coriandrum sativum, Spinacia oleracea, Trigonella corniculata and Trigonella foenum-graecum showed lower inhibitory concentration values (4.1-7.9 mg/ml), efficiency concentration values (178-321 mg/mg DPPH) and higher values of anti-radical power (0.31-0.51) as compared with their seeds. Thermal treatment reduced the total phenolic contents, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities. The leaves of C. sativum were found with good amounts of caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and chlorogenic acid.",1
"Cuproptosis is a brand-new copper-dependent type of cell death that has been linked to various tumors. However, the relationship between cuproptosis and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains to be further elaborated. In ALL, 12 cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) were analyzed at genetic and single-cell levels. Two molecular clusters were identified using ""ConsensusClusterPlus"". With the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, a prognostic signature was built based on cuproptosis. The prognosis, clinical parameters, biological function, immune cell infiltration, therapy sensitivities, and transcription factor regulation of the clusters and risk subsets were further compared. Kaplan Meier curves, time-ROC curves, and nomogram were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the signature. Lastly, qRT-PCR was used to detect prognostic genes in cell lines and clinical samples. CRGs exhibited extensive genetic variations and heterogeneous expression profiles in ALL. Single-cell analysis demonstrated that CRGs were strongly correlated with the biological characteristics of cancer cells. Two clusters and risk subgroups with distinct clinicopathological features, prognoses, biological functions, and drug sensitivities were identified. The cuproptosis signature was crucial in characterizing tumor immune landscape and cancer cell self-renewal ability. Furthermore, we explored that subtype A and high-scoring groups were more sensitive to immunotherapy. Multiple drugs with higher sensitivity among high-risk subgroups have been predicted. Nomograms demonstrated the clinical applicability of cuproptosis in risk assessment. The model was further validated in the verification cohort, our clinical specimens, and cell lines. The cuproptosis-based model can characterize the tumor microenvironment, forecast survival results, and aid in improving risk assessment and personalized therapy options in ALL.",0
"Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, used to treat childhood hematological malignancies (acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL] and acute myelocytic leukemia [AML]) can negatively affect oral tissues and organs. This study aimed to evaluate the oral health-related quality of life in children with ALL/AML. A total of 99 children, including 49 undergoing ALL/AML (41 with ALL and eight with AML) and 50 healthy volunteers, were included in this cross-sectional study. The mean age of the entire study group was 78.63 ± 34.41 months. The mean age of the ALL/AML and control groups was 87.12 ± 35.04 and 70.95 ± 34.85 months, respectively. The Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (SOHI), the Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth (DMFT/dmft) index, and the Turkish version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS-T) were administered to all children. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 22.0). The Pearson chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare demographic data. The age and gender distributions of the two groups were similar. According to ECOHIS-T, the children in the ALL/AML group had significantly more loss of function (eating, drinking, sleeping, etc.) than those in the control group. Oral health and self-care were negatively affected by childhood ALL/AML and its treatment.",0
"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most common type of cancer found in children. Although the overall survival rates are now >80%, 15%-20% of pediatric patients relapse, with survival rates subsequently dropping to 5%-10%. Cmpd10357, 3-amino-5-arylamino-6-chloro-N- (diaminomethylene) pyrazine-2-carboximide, is a highly potent, cell-permeant compound recently shown to have cytotoxic effects on solid tumors, including human breast cancer and high-grade gliomas, independent of their proliferative status. Cmpd10357 demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in two human B-ALL cell lines, JM1 and Reh, at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC",0
"CREB binding protein (CREBBP) is a key epigenetic regulator, altered in a fifth of relapsed cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Selectively targeting epigenetic signaling may be an effective novel therapeutic approach to overcome drug resistance. Anti-tumor effects have previously been demonstrated for GSK-J4, a selective H3K27 histone demethylase inhibitor, in several animal models of cancers. To characterize the effect of GSK-J4, drug response profiling, CRISPR-Dropout Screening, BH3 profiling and immunoblotting were carried out in ALL cell lines or patient derived samples. Here we provide evidence that GSK-J4 downregulates cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and CREBBP in B-cell precursor-ALL cell lines and patient samples. High CREBBP expression in BCP-ALL cell lines correlated with high GSK-J4 sensitivity and low dexamethasone sensitivity. GSK-J4 treatment also induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL dependency and apoptosis. This study proposes H3K27 demethylase inhibition as a potential treatment strategy for patients with treatment-resistant ALL, using CREBBP as a biomarker for drug response and combining GSK-J4 with venetoclax and navitoclax as synergistic partners.",0
"A method was developed for simultaneous analysis of natural antioxidants in beer using multichannel electrochemical detection with a CoulArray detector, which enables selective and sensitive antioxidant detection in gradient HPLC and facilitates the identification of analytes based on the ratios of signals recorded at different potentials applied to the detection cells arranged in series. The separation conditions were optimised for 27 phenolic compounds including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides identified in beer samples. Separation selectivities of 11 columns with different stationary phase chemistries were compared, and the pH and gradient programs were optimised for the individual columns to provide best resolution and high number of resolved peaks, using the window-diagram approach. The effects of pH on the sensitivity of electrochemical coulometric detection were considered in the optimisation approach. The optimised conditions were applied to the analysis of real beer samples.",1
"In children, respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza share similar clinical signs and symptoms. Here we compared the performance of a rapid antigen diagnostic test using a self-collected anterior nasal swab (COVID-VIRO ALL IN TRIPLEX) and multiplex RT-PCR. From October to December 2022, in the emergency pediatrics unit of Orleans Hospital, France, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the triplex test. For the 263 children, sensitivity of the test was 88.9% (95%CI 51.8-99.7), 79.1% (95%CI 64.0-90.0), and 91.6% (95%CI 84.1-96.3), for SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza, respectively. Specificity was 100% for each virus. For RT-PCR with cycle threshold < 32, sensitivity was 100.0% [95%CI 59.0-100.0], 87.2% [95%CI 72.6-95.7] and 92.3% [95%CI 84.896.9] for SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and influenza respectively. This easy-to-perform triplex test is a considerable advance, allowing clinicians to obtain an accurate diagnosis in most cases of respiratory infection. More data are needed to validate this test in different contexts and across several seasons.",0
"Curcumin, derived from the rhizome curcuma longa, is one of the primary ingredients in turmeric and curry powders that are used as spices in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, especially on the Indian subcontinent. More recently, laboratory studies have demonstrated that dietary curcumin exhibits various biological activities and significantly inhibits colon tumorigenesis and tumor size in animals. Curcumin displays both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, giving it the potential to be considered in the development of cancer preventive strategies and applications in clinical research. Experimental studies have shown the biological activities of the compound, but much more information on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and food content are needed. Whether the amount of curcumin in turmeric and curry powders is sufficient to suggest effects on biological activities and cancer risk is unknown. To determine and compare the quantitative amounts of curcumin that are present in several brands of turmeric and curry powders, a high performance liquid chromatography technique was used to analyze 28 spice products described as turmeric or curry powders and two negative controls. Pure turmeric powder had the highest curcumin concentration, averaging 3.14% by weight. The curry powder samples, with one exception, had relatively small amounts of curcumin present, and the variability in content was great. The curcumin content of these seasoning products that are consumed as a component of the diet should be considered in evaluating baseline tissue concentration and response to curcumin supplementation, which is under study in chemoprevention trials.",1
"Fresh strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), raspberries (Rubus idaeus Michx.), highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) were stored at 0, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C for up to 8 days to determine the effects of storage temperature on whole fruit antioxidant capacity (as measured by the oxygen radical absorbing capacity assay, Cao et al., Clin. Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.",1
"Although initial central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rarely detected in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), risk-adapted CNS-directed therapy is essential for all patients. Treatment intensity depends on the initial CNS status. In the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 trial, patients with cytomorphologic detection of leukemic blasts in initial cerebrospinal fluid were classified as CNS2 or CNS3 and received five intrathecal doses of methotrexate (MTX) in induction therapy compared to patients with CNS1 status (no blasts detected) who received three doses. The impact of additional intrathecal (IT) MTX on systemic toxicity in induction therapy is unknown. Between June 1st 2010 and February 28th 2017, a total of 6,136 ALL patients aged 1-17 years were enrolled onto the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 trial. The effect of three versus five doses of IT MTX during induction therapy on the incidence of severe infectious complications was analyzed. Among 4,706 patients treated with three IT MTX doses, 77 (1.6%) had a life-threatening infection during induction as compared to 59 of 1,350 (4.4%) patients treated with five doses (P<0.001; Odds Ratio 2.86 [95% Confidence Interval 1.99-4.13]). In a multivariate regression model, treatment with additional IT MTX proved to be the strongest risk factor for life-threatening infections (Odds Ratio 2.85 [1.96-4.14]). Fatal infections occurred in 16 (0.3%) and 38 (1.6%) patients treated with three or five IT MTX doses, respectively (P<0.001). As the relevance of additional intrathecal MTX in induction for relapse prevention in CNS2 patients is unclear, doses of intrathecal therapy have been reduced for these patients.

"Flavonoids and related plant compounds in fruits and vegetables are of particular importance as they have been found to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. The HPLC-based quantitative procedure, with improved extraction and hydrolysis, was used to analyze the content of the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 10 black currant cultivars from organic farms and in 5 cultivars from conventional farms. Myricetin was the most abundant flavonol, and its amount varied significantly among cultivars, from 8.9 to 24.5 mg x 100 g(-1) (fresh weight). The quercetin levels in black currant also varied widely among the cultivars, from 5.2 to 12.2 mg x 100 g(-1). The kaempferol levels in black currant cultivars were low, ranging from 0.9 to 2.3 mg x 100 g(-1). The sum of these major flavonols varied widely among black currant cultivars. No consistent differences in the contents of flavonols were found between the same black currant cultivars grown in organic and conventional ways. The high variability in the levels of flavonols in different cultivars offers possible avenues for identifying and selecting cultivars rich in certain flavonols for the special production of berries for industrial use.",1
"Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (s-ALL) comprises up to 10% of ALL patients. However, data regarding s-ALL outcomes is limited. To answer what is the role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in s-ALL, a matched-pair analysis in a 1:2 ratio was conducted to compare outcomes between s-ALL and de novo ALL (dn-ALL) patients reported between 2000-2021 to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. Among 9720 ALL patients, 351 (3.6%) were s-ALL, of which 80 were in first complete remission (CR1) with a known precedent primary diagnosis 58.8% solid tumor (ST), 41.2% hematological diseases (HD). The estimated 2-year relapse incidence (RI) was 19.1% (95%CI: 11-28.9), leukemia-free survival (LFS) 52.1% (95%CI: 39.6-63.2), non-relapse mortality (NRM) 28.8% (95%CI: 18.4-40), GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) 39.4% (95%CI: 27.8-50.7), and overall survival (OS) 60.8% (95%CI: 47.9-71.4), and did not differ between ST and HD patients. In a matched-pair analysis, there was no difference in RI, GRFS, NRM, LFS, or OS between s-ALL and dn-ALL except for a higher incidence of chronic GvHD (51.9% vs. 31.4%) in s-ALL. To conclude, patients with s-ALL who received HCT in CR1 have comparable outcomes to patients with dn-ALL.",0
"To study the safety and short-term effectiveness of blinatumomab in the treatment of childhood relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R-ALL). Six children with R/R-ALL who received blinatumomab treatment from August 2021 to August 2022 were included as subjects, and a retrospective analysis was performed for their clinical data. Among the six children, there were three boys and three girls, with a median age of 10.5 (5.0-13.0) years at the time of inclusion. Of all six children, one had refractory ALL and did not achieve remission after several times of chemotherapy, and 5 relapsed for the first time, with a median time of 30 (9-60) months from diagnosis to relapse. Minimal residual disease (MRD) before treatment was 15.50% (0.08%-78.30%). Three children achieved complete remission after treatment, among whom two had negative conversion of MRD. Five children had cytokine release syndrome (CRS), among whom 3 had grade 1 CRS and 2 had grade 2 CRS. Four children were bridged to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with a median interval of 50 (40-70) days from blinatumomab treatment to transplantation. The six children were followed up for a median time of 170 days, and the results showed an overall survival rate of 41.7% (95% Blinatumomab has good short-term safety and effectiveness in the treatment of childhood R/R-ALL, and its long-term effectiveness needs to be confirmed by studies with a larger sample size.",0
"The water-soluble ellagitanin punicalagin has been reported to be toxic to cattle. Taking into account that this antioxidant polyphenol is very abundant in pomegranate juice (> or =2 g/L), the present study evaluated the possible toxic effect of punicalagin in Sprague-Dawley rats upon repeated oral administration of a 6% punicalagin-containing diet for 37 days. Punicalagin and related metabolites were identified by HPLC-DAD-MS-MS in plasma, liver, and kidney. Five punicalagin-related metabolites were detected in liver and kidney, that is, two ellagic acid derivatives, gallagic acid, 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one glucuronide, and 3,8,10-trihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one. Feedstuff intake, food utility index, and growth rate were lower in treated rats during the first 15 days without significant adverse effects, which could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet together with a decrease in its palatability (lower food intake). No significant differences were found in treated rats in any blood parameter analyzed (including the antioxidant enzymes gluthatione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) with the exception of urea and triglycerides, which remained at low values throughout the experiment. Although the reason for the decrease is unclear, it could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet with respect to the standard rat food. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney corroborated the absence of toxicity. In principle, the results reported here, together with the large safety margin considered, indicate the lack of toxic effect of punicalagin in rats during the 37 day period investigated. However, taking into account the high punicalagin content of pomegranate-derived foodstuffs, safety evaluation should be also carried out in humans with a lower dose and during a longer period of intake.",1
"L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) remains a vital chemotherapeutic agent for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), primarily due to its mechanism of depleting circulating asparagine essential for leukemic cell proliferation. However, existing ASNases (including pegylated ones) face limitations including immunogenicity, rapid clearance, and off-target toxicities. Earlier, we have shown that the conjugation of L-ASNase with the polyamines and their copolymers results in significant enhancement of the antiproliferative activity due to accumulation in tumor cells. We suggested that this effect is probably mediated by polyamine transport system (PTS) receptors that are overexpressed in ALL cells. Here, we investigated the effect of competitive inhibitors of PTS receptors to the L-ASNase interaction with cancer cells (L5178Y, K562 and A549). L-ASNase from",0
"The amounts of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were analyzed in 16 red and 2 white berry and grape wines after acid hydrolysis using an RP-HPLC method with diode array detection. The red berry wines analyzed were made mainly from black currant, crowberry, and bog whortleberry, i.e., berries rich in flavonols. The red grape wines were made mainly from Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot grapes in several countries. The white wines studied were gooseberry and white currant wines and Chardonnay and Riesling wines. The amount of myricetin ranged from 3.8 to 22.6 mg L(-1) in red berry wines and from 0 to 14.6 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. The amount of quercetin was from 2.2 to 24.3 mg L(-1) red berry wines and from <1.2 to 19.4 mg L(-1) in red grape wines. Low levels of kaempferol were found in all red berry wines and in 9 red grape wines. The total concentration of these flavonols was from 6 to 46 mg L(-1) (mean 20 mg L(-1)) in red berry wines and from 4 to 31 mg L(-1) (mean 15 mg L(-1)) in red grape wines. Small amounts of quercetin were found in white currant and gooseberry wines, whereas no flavonols were detected in white grape wines. These results demonstrate that the contents of flavonols in red",1
"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurs when there is immune recovery after a prolonged period of leucopenia as a response to an underlying latent or chronic infection due to a proinflammatory cascade. It can occur in a child on chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with underlying chronic disseminated candidiasis (CDC). We present a 7-year-old girl with pre-B ALL on chemotherapy who had prolonged febrile neutropenia and CDC with microabscesses in the liver, spleen, and kidney and a prolonged intensive care unit stay. Upon neutrophil recovery, she continued to have high-grade fever (blood and urine cultures negative). She also presented severe myositis of bilateral thigh muscles and developed unusual granulomas in the subcutaneous region of the lower back and right thigh. Although IRIS was suspected, she could not be initiated on steroids due to right upper lobe collapse consolidation due to multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumanni, which was treated with sensitive antibiotics. Treatment with steroids resolved her fever and normalized inflammatory markers. She is currently well on maintenance chemotherapy. IRIS can complicate the treatment of ALL in children. Diagnosing it while having a concurrent bacterial infection is challenging. Rarely CDC can present with subcutaneous granulomas. Treatment with steroids at the right time is very crucial.",0
"Although the overall survival rate of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in childhood is more than 80%, it is merely 30% in refractory/relapsed and adult patients with B-ALL. This demonstrates a need for improved therapy targeting this subgroup of B-ALL. Here, we show that the ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) protein, a dioxygenase involved in DNA demethylation, is overexpressed and plays a crucial oncogenic role independent of its catalytic activity in B-ALL. Consistent with its oncogenic role in B-ALL, overexpression of TET1 alone in normal precursor B cells is sufficient to transform the cells and cause B-ALL in mice within 3 to 4 months. We found that TET1 protein is stabilized and overexpressed because of its phosphorylation mediated by protein kinase C epsilon (PRKCE) and ATM serine/threonine kinase (ATM), which are also overexpressed in B-ALL. Mechanistically, TET1 recruits STAT5B to the promoters of",0
"It is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary flavonols to understand their role in disease prevention. Lightly fried onions containing 275 micromol flavonols, principally quercetin-4'-glucoside and quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, were fed to healthy human volunteers and plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Samples were analysed by HPLC with diode array and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Five flavonol metabolites, quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide, a quercetin diglucuronide and a quercetin glucuronide sulphate, were detected in plasma in quantifiable amounts with trace quantities of six additional quercetin metabolites. Sub-micromolar peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were observed 0.6-0.8 h after ingestion. In contrast, the Cmax of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 2.5 h. The elimination half-lives (t1/2) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were 1.71, 2.33 and 1.76 h respectively, while the t1/2 of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide was 5.34 h and that of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 4.54 h. The profile of metabolites excreted in urine was markedly different to that of plasma with many of the major urinary components, including quercetin-3'-glucuronide, two quercetin glucoside sulphates and a methylquercetin diglucuronide, absent or present in only trace amounts in the bloodstream indicative of substantial phase II metabolism. Total urinary excretion of quercetin metabolites was 12.9 micromol, corresponding to 4.7 % of intake. If these samples had been subjected to hydrolysis, as in many previous studies, only quercetin and isorhamnetin would have been detected and quantified. The bioactivity of these metabolites should be considered.",1
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a highly invasive hematological malignancy originated from T-lineage progenitor cells. The clonal proliferation and aggregation of primordial cells in bone marrow inhibit normal hematopoietic function, resulting in a series of hematocytopenia and infiltration symptoms. SET-NUP214 fusion is a recurrent event that is common in adult male T-ALL patients. It originates from chromosome del(9)(q34.11; q34.13) or t(9; 9)(q34; q34). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can significantly improve the survival rate of these patients. Due to the poor prognosis of patients and high relapse rate after remission, more effective strategies need to be proposed to improve prognosis and prevent relapse. Chidamide is a novel oral benzamide histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) that can exert anti-tumor effects through multiple mechanisms. Here we report chidamide maintenance therapy after allo-HSCT in patients with SET-NUP214 fusion positive T-ALL. Both patients improved effectively during follow-up, confirming the efficacy of chidamide in improving the condition of these patients and may provide valuable clinical information for the treatment of this rare and understudied disease.",0
"The content of total phenolic compounds (TPC) and chlorogenic acid (CA) and the antioxidant activity in the methanolic extracts of edible parts of three early and two late Italian artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) varieties were determined and compared. TPC content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activity by the DPPH method. CA quantification was carried out by HPLC and GC/MS using CA methyl ester as internal standard. Results showed that artichoke varieties differ considerably in their TPC (7.31-13.05 mg/g fresh weight) and CA (1.36-2.46 mg/g fresh weight) content, as well as in their antioxidant activity. No significant correlation was observed between TPC content and DPPH scavenging activity. Boiling the inner bracts of the heads led to a 46% loss of CA.",1
"The management of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common pediatric malignancy, critically relies on thiopurine therapy, such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), during the maintenance phase. However, significant inter-individual response variety and high risk of myelosuppression often disrupt therapy efficacy. Pharmacogenetics offer crucial strategies to personalized therapy. While thiopurine methyltransferase (",0
"Vincristine is a mainstay treatment for paediatric cancers, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with common toxicity including vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy (VIPN). The present study comprehensively assessed VIPN outcomes in patients receiving vincristine treatment for ALL. Children diagnosed with ALL commencing vincristine treatment were prospectively evaluated (baseline, post-induction, pre-reinduction, post-reinduction, follow-up). VIPN was examined clinically using the Balis sensory/motor scale, neurophysiologically using axonal excitability techniques and quality-of-life using Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Thirty-one patients were recruited to this study (age = 6.8 ± 4.4; 61.3% female). Incidence of motor VIPN (motor Balis grade > 0) symptoms were higher than sensory VIPN (sensory Balis grade > 0) at post-induction (92.0% vs 36.0%) and post-reinduction (81.8% vs 22.7%) vincristine treatment. Neurophysiological assessment also demonstrated greater change in motor axonal excitability parameters compared to sensory parameters including changes in depolarising threshold electrotonus (P < 0.0125), superexcitability and subexcitability parameters (all P < 0.0125). Follow-up assessment demonstrated persisting VIPN symptoms with reduced quality-of-life scores compared to baseline. Clinical and neurophysiological evaluation of VIPN suggests vincristine produces a motor-prominent sensorimotor neuropathy in children which persisted at follow-up. VIPN signs and symptoms develop early in the treatment course, in line with axonal excitability profiles. Early detection of significant nerve changes may support timely implementation of neuroprotection strategies.",0
"Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP) has been shown to produce significant antitumor activities, but its effect on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains elusive. Herein were confirmed that DOP contains six major glycosidic bonds with pharmacological activities. We explored the therapeutic targets and mechanisms of DOP using network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation. By analyzing the data from publicly available databases and RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) profiles of DOP-treated Jurkat cells, we identified 13 common targets shared by DOP and T-ALL. Using STRING for protein-protein interaction network construction and CytoHuba for target identification, 13 hub targets including CARD11 and CCND1 were identified. GO and KEGG pathway analyses showed that these hub targets were involved in regulation of cell apoptosis and proliferation through the key pathways related to cancer, cell cycle, PI3K-AKT, and NF-κB signaling. The clinical relevance of these targets was verified by UALCAN and GEPIA2. Molecular docking analyses indicated significant interactions between glycosidic structures of DOP and the key targets. Experimental validation with Jurkat cells demonstrated that DOP treatment induced cell cycle arrest in S phase, increased cell apoptosis rates compared to cytosine, and caused changes in expression levels of 13 genes, which supported the antitumor effects of DOP against T-ALL. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of DOP against T-ALL and highlight its multifaceted role in targeting diverse therapeutic pathways.",0
"To identify the major metabolites of resveratrol in rat, rat urine samples were pretreated by using solid-phase extraction technique (SPE) with polyamide cartridges. And a LC-MS/MS method with electrospray ionisation (ESI), negative ion mode and collision induced dissociation (CID), was used to elucidate the structures of the major metabolites of resveratrol. According to the results of our experiment, we found that the main metabolites of resveratrol were resveratrol monoglucuronide (M1), dihydroresveratrol monosulfate (M2), resveratrol monosulfate (M3) and dihydroresveratrol (M4).",1
"Twenty-four plant lignans were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in bran extracts of 16 cereal species, in four nut species, and in two oilseed species (sesame seeds and linseeds). Eighteen of these were lignans previously unidentified in these species, and of these, 16 were identified in the analyzed samples. Four different extraction methods were applied as follows: alkaline extraction, mild acid extraction, a combination of alkaline and mild acid extraction, or accelerated solvent extraction. The extraction method was of great importance for the lignan yield. 7-Hydroxymatairesinol, which has not previously been detected in cereals because of destructive extraction methods, was the dominant lignan in wheat, triticale, oat, barley, millet, corn bran, and amaranth whole grain. Syringaresinol was the other dominant cereal lignan. Wheat and rye bran had the highest lignan content of all cereals; however, linseeds and sesame seeds were by far the most lignan-rich of the studied species.",1
"Experts from the European Leukemia Net (ELN) working group for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia have identified an unmet need for guidance regarding management of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from diagnosis to aftercare. The group has previously summarized their recommendations regarding diagnostic approaches, prognostic factors, and assessment of ALL. The current recommendation summarizes clinical management. It covers treatment approaches, including the use of new immunotherapies, application of minimal residual disease for treatment decisions, management of specific subgroups, and challenging treatment situations as well as late effects and supportive care. The recommendation provides guidance for physicians caring for adult patients with ALL which has to be complemented by regional expertise preferably provided by national academic study groups.",0
"The quercetin and kaempferol contents of 13 varieties of lettuce were determined. Leaf lettuce varieties contained 2-54 mg of quercetin/kg, while head lettuce varieties contained 1-28 mg/kg, more in the outer leaves than in the inner leaves. These samples also contained 0-2 mg of kaempferol/kg. Chives contained 55 mg of kaempferol and 9 mg of quercetin per kg in green proteins and lesser amounts in white portions, while leek contained 20 mg of kaempferol/kg in green portions and no detectable quercetin in either portion. Two varieties of kale contained 7-20 mg of quercetin and 13-30 mg of kaempferol per kg. Other vegetables examined contained lesser amounts of these flavonols. No myricetin was detected in these samples.",1
"Childhood leukemia (CL) is the most prevalent form of pediatric cancer on a global scale. However, there is a limited understanding of the dynamics of CL incidence in South America, with a specific knowledge gap in Colombia. This study aimed to identify trends in CL incidence and to analyze the effects of age, period, and birth cohort on the risk of leukemia incidence in this population. Information on all newly diagnosed leukemia cases (in general and by subtype) among residents aged 0-18 years and living in the serving areas of population-based cancer registries of Cali (2008-2017), Bucaramanga (2000-2017), Manizales (2003-2017), and Pasto (1998-2018). Estimated annual percent changes (EAPC) in incidence over time and potential changes in the slope of these EAPCs were calculated using joinpoint regression models. The effects of age, period, and cohort in CL incidence trends were evaluated using age-period-cohort models addressing the identifiability issue through the application of double differences. A total of 966 childhood leukemia cases were identified. The average standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of leukemia was calculated and expressed per 100,000 person-years - observing ASIR of 4.46 in Cali, 7.27 in Bucaramanga, 3.89 in Manizales and 4.06 in Pasto. Concerning CL trends there were no statistically significant changes in EAPC throughout the different periods, however, when analyzed by leukemia subtype, statistically significant changes were observed in the EAPC for both ALL and AML. Analysis of age-period-cohort models revealed that age-related factors significantly underpin the incidence trends of childhood leukemia in these four Colombian cities. This study offers valuable insights into the incidence trends of childhood leukemia in four major Colombian cities. The analysis revealed stable overall CL incidence rates across varying periods, predominantly influenced by age-related factors and the absence of cohort and period effects. This information is useful for surveillance and planning purposes for CL diagnosis and treatment in Colombia.",0
"It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.",1
"Childhood cancers are an important cause of premature mortality and long-term disability worldwide, yet most global estimates stop at broad diagnostic groups. A clearer picture by subtype and its social determinants is needed to guide the World Health Organization (WHO) target of at least sixty percent survival for all children with cancer by 2030. In this population-based registry study, we analysed incidence and mortality data for 185 countries in 2022 using the GLOBOCAN database, and redistributed unspecified tumours according to subtype proportions derived from 670 high-quality population-based registries in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents XII. For unspecified subtype cases, we assumed they most likely belonged to main subtypes and proportionally reallocated them to specified categories. Age-standardised rates (ASRs) were calculated with the World Standard Population. Multivariable linear regression examined associations between subtype-specific incidence and national socioeconomic and health-system indicators, adjusting for multicollinearity. An estimated 211,080 new cases and 78,441 deaths due to childhood cancers occurred globally in 2022. Leukaemia was the most common cancer, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) comprising 66.73% of leukaemia cases, and an ASR of 2.04 per 100,000 population. Brain tumours account for 45.00% of brain and central nervous system cancers, with an ASR of 0.56 per 100,000 population. Burkitt lymphoma represented 17.64% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases, with the highest number of incidence cases observed in sub-Saharan Africaand an ASR of 0.32 per 100,000 population. Across most subtypes, incidence was higher in boys than girls. Countries with higher Universal Health Coverage service indices and better healthcare infrastructure had significantly higher reported incidence rates for multiple subtypes, including ALL ( Subtype-specific childhood cancer incidence varies substantially across regions, reflecting disparities in data quality, healthcare access, and diagnostic capacity. Interpretation should be cautious given limitations in registry coverage, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and the small number of cases for certain subtypes and regions, which may affect accuracy and comparability. Strengthening childhood cancer registration systems is essential to improve surveillance, research, and policy planning.

"Carotenoids and flavonoids are the main tomatoes antioxidants, having an important role for human health. This study investigates the effects of different water regime and of the industrial processing on the concentration of these compounds in tomato fruits and in tomato products. Two biotypes of Corbarini small tomatoes were cultivated in the Sarno valley (Salerno, Italy) using three different water regimes. A biochemical characterization of the fresh and of the corresponding canned products was performed. Results show that water regime influenced the antioxidant profile of tomato fruits, with marked differences between the two biotypes. Data obtained highlight that water regime markedly influenced the productivity and the quality of the tomatoes. Results also demonstrated that industrial process increased carotenoids content without causing a significant flavonoids degradation.",1
"Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P = 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.",1
"Commercially important edible nut seeds were analyzed for chemical composition and moisture sorption. Moisture (1.47-9.51%), protein (7.50-21.56%), lipid (42.88-66.71%), ash (1.16-3.28%), total soluble sugars (0.55-3.96%), tannins (0.01-0.88%), and phytate (0.15-0.35%) contents varied considerably. Regardless of the seed type, lipids were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (>75% of the total lipids). Fatty acid composition analysis indicated that oleic acid (C18:1) was the main constituent of monounsaturated lipids in all seed samples. With the exception of macadamia, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the major polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the case of walnuts, in addition to linoleic acid (59.79%) linolenic acid (C18:3) also significantly contributed toward the total polyunsaturated lipids. Amino acid composition analyses indicated lysine (Brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, pine nut, and walnut), sulfur amino acids methionine and cysteine (almond), tryptophan (macadamia, pecan), and threonine (peanut) to be the first limiting amino acid as compared to human (2-5 year old) amino acid requirements. The amino acid composition of the seeds was characterized by the dominance of hydrophobic (range = 37.16-44.54%) and acidic (27.95-33.17%) amino acids followed by basic (16.16-21.17%) and hydrophilic (8.48-11.74%) amino acids. Trypsin inhibitory activity, hemagglutinating activity, and proteolytic activity were not detected in the nut seed samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms (Aw range = 0.08-0.97) indicated a narrow range for monolayer water content (11-29 mg/g of dry matter). No visible mold growth was evident on any of the samples stored at Aw < 0.53 and 25 degrees C for 6 months.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer in the world. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in miRNA and genes encoding proteins of the miRNA synthesis complex (SC) may affect the processing of drugs used in the treatment of ALL, resulting in treatment-related toxicities (TRTs). We investigated the role of 25 SNVs in microRNA genes and genes encoding proteins of the miRNA SC, in 77 patients treated for ALL-B from the Brazilian Amazon. The 25 SNVs were investigated using the TaqMan",0
"This work was carried out to investigate the pulp composition of four mango cultivars (Haden, Tommy Atkins and Ubá) at the ripening stage in relation to three components with antioxidant potential (total phenolics, carotenoids and ascorbic acid). Total phenolic compound content was estimated by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and total carotenoid content by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. The contents of beta-carotene and total vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid) were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Differences were found among the four mango cultivars in all the components analyzed. The content of phenolic compounds ranged from 48.40 (Haden) to 208.70 mg/100 g (Ubá); total carotenoid from 1.91 (Haden) to 2.63 mg/100 g (Palmer); beta-carotene from 661.27 (Palmer) to 2,220 microg/100 g (Ubá) and total ascorbic acid ranged from 9.79 (Tommy Atkins) to 77.71 mg/100 g (Ubá). These results corroborated previous information that mangoes are a good source of antioxidants in human diet.",1
"Thanks to an improved therapeutic regimen in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), 5 year-overall survival now exceeds 90%. Unfortunately, the 25% of children who relapse have an initial poor prognosis, potentially driven by pre-existing or emerging molecular anomalies. The latter are initially and essentially identified by cytogenetics. However, some subtle alterations are not visible through karyotyping. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array is an alternative way of chromosomal analysis allowing for a more in-depth evaluation of chromosomal modifications such as the assessment of copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). This method was applied here in retrospective diagnosis/relapse paired samples from seven children with BCP-ALL and in a prospective cohort of 38 newly diagnosed childhood cases. In the matched study, compared to the initial karyotype, SNP array analysis reclassified two patients as poor prognosis cases. Modulation during relapse was seen for 4 CNA and 0.9 LOH. In the prospective study, SNP reclassified the 10 patients with intermediate karyotype as 7 good prognosis and 3 poor prognosis. Ultimately, in all the children tested, SNP array allowed to identify additional anomalies compared to conventional karyotype, refine its prognostic value and identify some druggable anomalies that could be used for precision medicine. Overall, the anomalies detected could be segregated in four groups respectively involved in B-cell development, cell proliferation, transcription and molecular pathways. SNP therefore appears to be a method of choice in the integrated diagnosis of BCP ALL, especially for patients initially classified as intermediate prognosis. This complementary method of both cytogenetics and high throughput sequencing allows to obtain further classified information and can be useful in case of failure of these techniques.",0
"This work established the profile of caffeoyilquinic, ferulloylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acids in twenty different Brazilian herbal infusions using areversedphase high performance liquid chromatography method. The herbs analysed were: 'Alecrim', 'Boldo', 'Camomila', 'Carqueja', 'Cavalinha', 'Chá preto', 'chá mate tostado', 'Chapéu-de-couro', 'Cidreira', 'Erva-doce', 'Espinheirasanta', 'Ginkgobiloba', 'Ginseng', 'Guaco', 'Hortelã', 'Pata-de-vaca', “Porangaba”, 'Quebra-pedra', 'Sálvia' and 'Sene'. The 3-caffeoylquinic acid was found in 75 % of the infusions (18 to 5,200 mg Kg-1), while the 5-caffeoylquinic acid was found in 80 % of them (34 to 9,990 mg Kg-1). The highest concentrations of these were found in 'Chá mate tostado'. The 4-caffeoylquinic acid appeared in 55 % of the herbs (23 to 1,600 mg Kg-1), with 'Chapéu-de-couro' and 'Carqueja' being the richer ones. The 4-ferulloylquinic acid was found in 35 % of the infusions (51 to 1,800 mg Kg-1 of herbs) and the 5-ferulloyl quínic acid was detected in 45 % of them (39 to 1,300 mg Kg-1). In spite of the low concentrations (30 to 560 mg Kg-1), the 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid appeared in 50 % of the herbs. The distribution of the other dicaffeoylquinic isomers in the infusions was poor. The 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid was detected in 20 % of them (190 to 1,700 mg Kg-1), while only 15 % of the herbs comprised the 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic isomer. Considerable amounts of this last isomers were found just in 'Sálvia' (1,100 to52,700 mg Kg-1).",1

"Acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally, with increasing incidence rates observed in Saudi Arabia. Despite advances in treatment, there is a lack of localized, sex-specific forecasts to guide public health interventions. This study aims to forecast the future incidence of acute lymphoid leukaemia in males and females using ARIMA models. Saudi national cancer registries data from 1990 to 2019 were used. The dataset was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. ARIMA models were developed for male and female incidence, with model parameters determined using ACF and PACF plots. Stationarity was assessed using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, and model accuracy was validated using MAE, MSE, and MAPE. Forecasts included point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. For males, the ARIMA (3, 3, 3) model forecasted an increase in ALL incidences from 957 cases in 2020 to 2181 cases in 2029. For females, the ARIMA (4, 3, 0) model projected an increase from 1019 cases in 2020 to 2159 cases in 2029. The models demonstrated high accuracy, with MAE of 1.19895 and 2.749188, MSE of 62.33 and 31.83, and MAPE of 0.6805807 and 1.443453 for males and females, respectively. Forecasts indicate a substantial rise in ALL incidence among both sexes, highlighting the urgent need for improved surveillance, early detection, and healthcare capacity planning. Incorporating ARIMA modelling into routine monitoring could support proactive resource allocation. Further studies should integrate additional predictive variables to enhance model precision.",0
"High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by acid hydrolysis of the extracts.",1
"Although Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemia (Ph + -ALL) has been revolutionized with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), resistance and mutation are universal events during treatment with first-generation and second-generation TKIs. The present third-generation TKI has a dose-dependent, increased risk of serious cardiovascular events and the sensitivity is poor for patients with ≥2 mutations accompanied by the T315I mutation. Thus, novel and well-tolerated TKIs should be explored. This study analyzes the efficacy and advert effects of olverembatinib, a novel third TKI, in the treatment of newly diagnosed adult Ph + -ALL in induction therapy. Four adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph + -ALL were treated with olverembatinib as the first-line treatment. For induction therapy, these patients received 40 mg of oral olverembatinib quaque omni die for 28 days, 1 mg/kg/d of prednisone for 14 days, then tapered and stopped at 28 days and vindesine 4 mg/d at days 1, 8 and 15. After induction therapy, these patients received median or high-dose of cytarabine and methotrexate combined with oral olverembatinib as consolidation therapy. Then the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was performed. All patients reached complete remission with a complete cytogenetic response after induction therapy. Two patients reached major molecular remission and one with complete molecular remission. Before allo-HSCT, all the patients achieved complete molecular remission. All the patients have survived disease-free for 3-6 months. No severe advert effects were observed. It is well-tolerated and effective for olverembatinib in the treatment of newly diagnosed adult patients with Ph + -ALL. A prospective study should be performed to further testify the role.",0
"We performed a prospective study to determine the efficacy and safety of rituximab including chemotherapy in CD20-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with newly diagnosed ALL, aged ≥ 15 years, were eligible for the study if their leukemic blast cells in bone marrow expressed CD20 ≥ 20% at the time of diagnosis. Patients received multiagent chemotherapy with rituximab. After achieving complete remission (CR), patients received five cycles of consolidation with concomitant rituximab. Rituximab was administered monthly from day 90 of transplantation for patients who received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. In patients with Philadelphia (Ph)-negative ALL, 39 of 41 achieved CR (95.1%), the 2- and 4-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were 50.4% and 35.7%, and the 2- and 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 51.5% and 43.2%, respectively. In the group with Ph-positive ALL, all 32 patients achieved CR, the 2- and 4-year RFS rates were 60.7% and 52.1%, and the 2- and 4-year OS rates were 73.3% and 52.3%, respectively. In the Ph-negative ALL group, patients with higher CD20 positivity experienced more favorable RFS (p < 0.001) and OS (p = 0.06) than those with lower CD20 positivity. Patients who received ≥ 2 cycles of rituximab after transplantation had significantly improved RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; p = 0.049) and OS (HR, 0.29; p = 0.021) compared with those who received < 2 cycles. The addition of rituximab to conventional chemotherapy for CD20-positive ALL is effective and tolerable (Clinicaltrials. gov NCT01429610).",0
"The optimal induction strategy for mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is unknown, though retrospective data has shown improved remission rates and overall survival with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-based regimens. At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), the most utilized induction regimen for MPAL is high dose cytarabine plus mitoxantrone (""ALL-2""), though outcomes with this regimen are not well described. In this study, outcomes to first-line induction chemotherapy in 24 patients at MSKCC with MPAL classified by 2016 World Health Organization criteria are reported. The overall response rate was 94 % (16 of 17) in patients receiving ALL-2, including 86 % (6 of 7) in patients with extramedullary disease. Thirteen patients who received ALL-2 induction proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT). The most common toxicity associated with ALL-2 was febrile neutropenia, documented in 12 patients. With a median follow-up of 37 months, median overall survival was not reached in the ALL-2 cohort, and 3-year overall survival was 62 %. In multivariate analysis, age ≥ 60 years and MPAL with isolated extramedullary disease were associated with significantly worse overall survival (P = .009 and P = .01, respectively). These results support further prospective investigation of ALL-2 as a front-line induction regimen for adults with MPAL.",0
"To study the shared genetic structure between autoimmune diseases and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and identify the shared risk loci and genes and genetic mechanisms involved. Based on large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level data sets, we observed genetic overlaps between autoimmune diseases and B-ALL, and cross-trait pleiotropic analysis was performed to detect shared pleiotropic loci and genes. A series of functional annotation and tissue-specific analysis were performed to determine the influence of pleiotropic genes. The heritability enrichment analysis was used to detect crucial immune cells and tissues. Finally, bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were utilized to investigate the casual associations. Our research highlighted shared genetic mechanisms between seven autoimmune disorders and B-ALL. A total of 73 pleiotropic loci were identified at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10 Our research proved shared genetic architecture between autoimmune disorders and B-ALL and shed light on the potential mechanism that might involve in.",0
"A HPLC method coupled with coulometric electrode array detection for determination of daidzein and genistein in soy milk, soy-based infant food and nutritional supplements is described. The samples were spiked with bisphenol A (internal standard), extracted and hydrolyzed in an acid ethanolic solution. After purification of the extract on a C-18 cartridge the compounds were separated on a C-18 reversed phase column (50 mM sodium acetate adapted to pH 4.8 with glacial acetic acid/methanol at 450/550, v/v).

"The antioxidant activity of phenolic extracts from olives and olive oil has been assessed by scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and by studying the effects on the stability of stripped olive oil in the absence and presence of ferric chloride. The olive extracts contained a much higher concentration (1940–5800 mg kg−1) of phenolic components than the olive oil extract (180 mg kg−1). Some olive extracts were more effective than the olive oil extract in scavenging DPPH radicals, but the three varieties of olives examined showed relatively large differences in both polyphenol concentration and antioxidant activity of extracts. α-Tocopherol and extracts from both olives and olive oil were effective antioxidants in stripped olive oil at 60 °C. Ferric chloride reduced the stability of stripped olive oil, but the olive extract studied was significantly more effective as an antioxidant in the presence of the metal salt than the olive oil extract or α-tocopherol. Ferric ions catalysed the oxidation of caffeic acid, oleuropein and phenolic components of the olive and olive oil extracts in aqueous solution (pH 5.4). The olive extract oxidised more rapidly than the olive oil extract in aqueous solution.",1
"The effect of prior inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) treatment on brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) outcomes remains unclear in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of 189 patients with relapsed/refractory ALL treated with brexu-cel. Over half of the patients received InO before brexu-cel (InO exposed). InO-exposed patients were more heavily pretreated (P = .02) and frequently had active marrow disease before apheresis (P = .03). Response rate and toxicity profile after brexu-cel were comparable for InO-exposed and InO-naïve patients; however, consolidation therapy after brexu-cel response was used at a higher rate in InO-naïve patients (P = .005). With a median follow-up of 11.4 months, InO-exposed patients had inferior progression-free survival (PFS; P = .013) and overall survival (OS; P = .006) in univariate analyses; however, prior InO exposure did not influence PFS (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-2.03) in multivariate models. Within InO-exposed patients, InO responders had superior PFS (P = .002) and OS (P < .0001) relative to InO-refractory patients. The timing of administering InO did not affect brexu-cel outcomes, with comparable PFS (P = .51) and OS (P = .86) for patients receiving InO as bridging therapy or before apheresis. In conclusion, although InO exposure was associated with inferior survival outcomes after brexu-cel in unadjusted analyses, these associations were no longer significant in multivariate analyses, suggesting it is unlikely that InO negatively affects brexu-cel efficacy. Our data instead imply that InO-exposed recipients of brexu-cel tend to be higher-risk patients with intrinsic adverse leukemia biology.",0
"The phenolic composition, aroma compounds, and organic acid content of 83 vinegars have been determined. Multivariate analysis techniques have been used to classify these vinegar samples according to raw material (white wine, red wine, apple, honey, alcohol, balsamic, and malt) and production process (with and without aging in wood). Cluster analysis grouped the samples according to production process. Only apple and balsamic vinegars were separated from wine vinegars. Alcohol, honey, and malt vinegars were grouped with no aged wine vinegars. Linear discriminate analysis allowed a 88% differentiation according to raw material and 100% according to aging in wood. Besides, from the results obtained, a major role of the volatile compounds in the differentiation of the vinegar samples according to their aging period in wood can be seen.",1
"Over the past 40 years, the 5-years-overall survival rate of pediatric cancer reached 75-80%, and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), exceeded 90%. Leukemia continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity for specific patient populations, including infants, adolescents, and patients with high-risk genetic abnormalities. The future of leukemia treatment needs to count better on molecular therapies as well as immune and cellular therapy. Advances in the scientific interface have led naturally to advances in the treatment of childhood cancer. These discoveries have involved the recognition of the importance of chromosomal abnormalities, the amplification of the oncogenes, the aberration of tumor suppressor genes, as well as the dysregulation of cellular signaling and cell cycle control. Lately, novel therapies that have already proven efficient on relapsed/refractory ALL in adults are being evaluated in clinical trials for young patients. Tirosine kinase inhibitors are, by now, part of the standardized treatment of Ph+ALL pediatric patients, and Blinatumomab, with promising results in clinical trials, received both FDA and EMA approval for use in children. Moreover, other targeted therapies such as aurora-kinase inhibitors, MEK-inhibitors, and proteasome-inhibitors are involved in clinical trials that include pediatric patients. This is an overview of the novel leukemia therapies that have been developed starting from the molecular discoveries and those that have been applied in pediatric populations.",0
"T-cell receptor (TCR) loci undergo complex V(D)J rearrangements during T-cell maturation. However, errors in this process can cause TCR promoters and enhancers to aberrantly fuse with oncogenes, leading to their overexpression and the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Unexpectedly, in a retrospective study of 97 pediatric B-ALL cases, all diagnosed according to WHO criteria at a single institution, we identified a subgroup of B-ALL harboring TCR fusion. These fusions involved diverse partner genes, including LINC01656, TBC1D10B, TCL1A/TCL1B, CDKN2A, CEBPB/G, and AHI1. Patients with TCR fusions showed a gene expression profile enriched in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) signatures and frequently carried other adverse genomic markers, such as CDKN2A/B alterations and RAS pathway activation. Clinically, TCR-rearranged B-ALL patients were associated with increased risk (P = 0.005) and had higher minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 19 (P = 0.034), and may benefit from MRD-based risk-directed therapy. Our study highlights frequent TCR fusions in B-ALL, suggesting a stem cell-derived leukemia with potential differentiation into both B-cell and T-cell lineages.",0
"It is generally assumed that the higher the total polyphenols content of a beverage, the greater is its antioxidant activity. Our previous experiments on laboratory animals and clinical investigations showed that the content of total polyphenols is higher in white wine than in beer, but beer possessed a higher antioxidant activity. In order to find the sources, which determine the degree of the antioxidant activity the comparative content of some important phenolics in beer, red and white wines was examine. Total polyphenols, procyanidins, epicatechin, quercetin, ferulic p-coumaric and gallic acids were determined in these beverages. The content of total polyphenols was significantly higher in red wine than in white wine and beer (p < 0.0025 in both cases). Similar relationship was found for procyanidins, epicatechin, and quercetin, ferulic, p-coumaric and gallic acids (p < 0.0005 in most cases. The contents of total polyphenols and quercetin were significantly higher in white wine than in beer (p < 0.0125 and 0.01, respectively). But the contents of procyanidins, epicatechin and ferulic acid were statistically significant higher in beer than in white wine (p < 0.005, p < 0.05 and p < 0.0025 respectively). The higher contents of procyanidins, epicatechin and ferulic acid in beer is a possible explanation of the marked antioxidant activity of diets supplemented with this beverage rather than with white wine in our experiments on laboratory animals.",1
"A highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ED) was developed for the determination of isoflavones. Electrochemical behaviour of daidzein and genistein was studied on carbon paste electrode (CPE) by adsorptive transfer stripping square wave voltammetry. The obtained electrochemical results were used for the development of HPLC-ED method. Furthermore, isoflavones were separated on an Atlantis dC18 column using a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.15M acetate buffer of pH 5.5 (solvent B) at a flow rate 0.4 mL/min. A linear gradient profile (solvent B) was at 0-2 min 87%; 22 min 60%; 27 min 50%; 31 min 45%; 47 min 87%. Full scan of multi-channel coulometric detection was tested and optimal potential at 450 mV was chosen for our purposes. Calibration curves were linear (daidzein R(2) = 0.9993 and genistein R(2) = 0.9987). The detection limit for daidzein/genistein was 480/394 pg/mL (1.8/1.5 nM) and per column 2.4/1.9 pg. Isoflavones extracted from soybean products (farina, meat, milk) by the accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) procedure and isoflavones present in human urine were determined by the HPLC-ED method.",1
"The association between individual-level poverty and relapse in children receiving maintenance treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains unclear. In a secondary analysis of COG-AALL03N1, we used data from US Census Bureau to categorize patients living below year-specific federal poverty thresholds, calculated using self-reported annual household income and size of household. Participants with federal poverty thresholds above 120% of their yearly household income were categorized as living in extreme poverty. Hazard of relapse was estimated using multivariable proportional subdistributional hazards regression for patients living in extreme poverty while receiving ALL maintenance therapy after adjusting for relevant predictors. Among 592 patients in this analysis, 12.3% of the patients were living in extreme poverty. After a median follow-up of 7.9 years, the cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years from study enrollment among those living in extreme poverty was significantly higher (14.3%) than those not living in extreme poverty (7.6%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that children living in extreme poverty had a 1.95-fold greater hazard of relapse than those not living in extreme poverty; this association was mitigated after the inclusion of race/ethnicity in the model, likely because of collinearity between race/ethnicity and poverty. A greater proportion of children living in extreme poverty were nonadherent to mercaptopurine (57.1% vs 40.9%); however, poor adherence did not completely explain the association between poverty and relapse risk. Future studies need to understand the mechanisms underlying the association between extreme poverty and relapse risk. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00268528.",0
"Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside (cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively. C3R contributed 92% of the total antioxidant capacity of the anthocyanin fraction. Fruits of the Mission variety contained the highest levels of polyphenols, flavonoids, and anthocyanins and exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity.",1
"The dietary polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to have chemopreventive activity against cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers in model systems, but it is not clear whether the drug reaches the proposed sites of action in vivo after oral ingestion, especially in humans. In this study, we examined the absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of 14C-resveratrol after oral and i.v. doses in six human volunteers. The absorption of a dietary relevant 25-mg oral dose was at least 70%, with peak plasma levels of resveratrol and metabolites of 491 +/- 90 ng/ml (about 2 microM) and a plasma half-life of 9.2 +/- 0.6 h. However, only trace amounts of unchanged resveratrol (<5 ng/ml) could be detected in plasma. Most of the oral dose was recovered in urine, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis identified three metabolic pathways, i.e., sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation of the phenolic groups and, interestingly, hydrogenation of the aliphatic double bond, the latter likely produced by the intestinal microflora. Extremely rapid sulfate conjugation by the intestine/liver appears to be the rate-limiting step in resveratrol's bioavailability. Although the systemic bioavailability of resveratrol is very low, accumulation of resveratrol in epithelial cells along the aerodigestive tract and potentially active resveratrol metabolites may still produce cancer-preventive and other effects.",1
"The antioxidant activity (AA) of acetone extracts of sage (Salvia officinalis L.), sweet grass (Hierocloë odorata Wahlnb.), sea buckthorn leaves (Hipophaë rhamnoı̈des L.), costmary (Balsamita major Desf., syn. Chrysanthemum balsamita L.), Roman camomile (Anthemis nobilis L.), and tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) were tested in refined, bleached and deodorised rapeseed oil at 40°C. The concentrations of the extracts added were in the range from 0.02 to 0.20% (w/w). The rate of oxidation was assessed by the measurement of peroxide value (PV) and calculation of such characteristics as induction period (IP), when PV reaches 20 meq kg−1, protection factor (PF), which is the ratio of IP of the sample with additive with IP of the sample without additive, and AA (the ratio of IP increase of the sample with extract with the IP increase of the sample with butylated hydroxytoluene). Sage and sweet grass extracts were found to be most effective in stabilising rapeseed oil, followed by tansy, Roman camomile, costmary and sea buckthorn in a decreasing order. The IP of rapeseed oil increased with extract concentration. AA's of the extracts added at different concentrations were the following: sage, sweet grass (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2%) and tansy (0.2%) — very high, (PF>3); tansy and Roman camomile (0.1%) — medium (PF=2–2.5), tansy (0.05%), Roman camomile (0.02 and 0.05%) and sea buckthorn (0.1 and 0.2%) — low (PF=1.5–2.0), tansy (0.02%) — very low (PF=1.0–1.5). The extracts of sea buckthorn (0.02 and 0.05%) slightly increased the formation of peroxides in rapeseed oil as compared with pure oil.",1
"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that has a profound impact on the host immune system. Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection modulates neonatal immune cell compartments, yet the full impact of in utero exposure on developing fetal immune cells remains poorly characterized. A series of recent studies have identified a potential link between cCMV infection and the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood. Here, we review the emerging evidence linking CMV and ALL risk, discuss what is known about the causes of childhood ALL, and propose how CMV infection in early life may confer increased ALL risk.",0
"Cereal brans such as wheat and rice are abundant sources for obtaining bioactive phenolic compounds such as ferulic and coumaric acids, in turn these can be bio-transformed into high value flavour compounds such as vanillin. Aspergillus niger CFR 1105, found to induce greater amounts of cell wall degrading enzymes, was inoculated into wheat and rice brans, and grown for 24, 48, 72 and 96h to understand the degradation pattern of non-starch polysaccharides and phenolic acid complexes. Native wheat bran polysaccharides mainly consisted of arabinose, xylose, galactose, and glucose, in % of 27:39:2:30, with traces of mannose, whereas rice bran consisted of arabinose, xylose, galactose, and glucose in % of 9:27:31:32, respectively. Both the cereal bran arabinoxylans were degraded extensively by A. niger at 96h, whereas the degradation of 1,3/1,4-β-d-glucans and cellulose was negligible. Bound phenolic acids of rice and wheat brans identified by HPLC were found to be mainly ferulic, coumaric, syringic acids in % of 93.6:6.3:0 (wheat), 34.7:55.8:9.5 (rice) and were drastically degraded/utilized at 96h. The above results have indicated preferential degradation of arabinoxylans of wheat bran by A. niger, which can be exploited to obtain bioactive compounds such as ferulic acid.",1
"In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries ( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in several studies.",1
"Heavy metals and metalloids are recognized as environmental threats, which are considered highly toxic and carcinogenic. Epidemiologically, their association with leukemia is under debate. We aim to clarify the association between the heavy metal(loid)s in serum and leukemia via a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases for all related articles. The standardized mean difference and its 95% confidence interval was used to evaluate the association of leukemia with heavy metal(loid)s in serum. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and Among 4,119 articles related to metal(loid)s and leukemia, 21 studies met our inclusion criteria, which are all cross-sectional studies. These 21 studies involved 1,316 cases and 1,310 controls, based on which we evaluate the association of heavy metals/metalloids in serum with leukemia. Our results indicated positive differences for serum chromium, nickel, and mercury in leukemia patients, while a negative difference for serum manganese in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Our results suggested an elevated trend of serum chromium, nickel, and mercury concentrations in leukemia patients while descending trend of serum manganese concentration in ALL patients. The result of sensitivity analysis between lead, cadmium, and leukemia and publication bias of association between chromium and leukemia also needed attention. Future research work may focus on the dose-response relationship between any of these elements and the leukemia risks, and further elucidation of how these elements are related to leukemia may shed light on the prevention and treatment of leukemia.

"The main phenolic compound in six studied lettuce cultivars (five green and one red) was identified as dicaffeoyl tartaric acid. Quantitative but not qualitative differences were found in the phenolic profiles among green cultivars. The red oak leaf cultivar contained twofold more dicaffeoyl tartaric acid and 10-fold more chlorogenic acid than the green cultivars. Total phenolics ranged from 8.4 to 12.9 mg g−1 dry weight in green varieties and reached 27.8 mg g−1 dry weight in red oak leaf. Carotenoids and vitamins E and C were also quantified. Lutein was the main carotenoid found in all cultivars, together with another xanthophyll. The period of harvesting had only a marginal influence on total phenolic levels, whereas carotenoid and vitamin E levels were higher at the second period of harvesting. Vitamin C levels ranged between 6.1 and 9.9 mg per 100 g fresh weight. We investigated the total antioxidant power in lettuce. Total phenolics accounted for more than 60% of the total antioxidant capacity. Dicaffeoyl tartaric acid accounted for 55%. ",1
"A modified HPLC method for the determination of trans-resveratrol in peanuts and peanut butter has been developed. The method used acetonitrile/water (9:1, v/v) as an extraction solvent followed by solid phase extraction on column packed with Al2O3 and AccuBandII SPE ODS C18. Eluate was evaporated under nitrogen stream and the residue was dissolved in LC mobile phase. Analytical data include the trans-resveratrol content of 15 different cultivars of raw peanuts produced from Korea, four roasted peanuts and seven peanut butter consumed in Korea. The trans-resveratrol content of the raw peanuts, roasted peanuts and peanut butter ranged from 0.09 to 0.30 μg/g, trace amount to 0.13 and 0.27 to 0.70 μg/g, respectively. Analytical method validation parameters including linearity, accuracy, precision, limits of detection and quantitation were determined. Overall recovery from peanut and peanut butter was close to 100% (n=10).",1
"Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.",1
"Two methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids in herb extracts. The methods were based on liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The methods were compared in terms of their linearity, repeatability, selectivity, sensitivity and the speed of the analysis. The sensitivity was good for both methods, with limits of detection of <80 ng/ml for most of the compounds. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas were on average 7.2% for the LC-TOFMS method and 1.4% for the GC-MS method. Both methods were found to be suitable for the determination of the target analytes, although GC-MS was better suited to the quantitative determination of compounds present at low concentrations.",1
"A HPLC method was developed for the analysis of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides in milled defatted flaxseed flour. Direct extraction by 1 M NaOH for 1 h at 20 degrees C resulted in a higher yield than that obtained by hydrolysis of alcoholic extracts. An internal standard, o-coumaric acid, was used and the method was found to be easy, fast, and with good repeatability. On dry matter basis, different samples of flaxseeds varied considerably in their content of (+)-SDG (11.9-25.9 mg/g), (-)-SDG (2.2-5.0 mg/g), p-coumaric acid glucoside (1.2-8.5 mg/g), and ferulic acid glucoside (1.6-5.0 mg/g).",1
"It is important to understand the outcomes of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients at different facilities as treatment paradigms change. Our primary objective was to determine adult ALL overall survival (OS) by facility volume and type. Secondary objectives included identifying sociodemographic factors that may have impacted outcomes and analyzing treatment patterns by facility volume and type. This was a retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) that included patients ≥40 years diagnosed with ALL between 2004 and 2016. A total of 14 593 patients were included in this study. Univariate OS was greatest at low volume (LV) and community programs (CPs) and the least at high volume (HV) and academic programs (AP). This difference was lost after multivariable Cox proportional hazards model analysis, which found no difference in survival by facility volume or type, however, survival was significantly influenced by age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, insurance, and residence location (p < 0.05). Patients treated at HV and APs compared to LV and CP received more anti-neoplastic directed therapy. Our results suggest treatment facility volume and type do not impact older adult ALL patient (≥40 years) survival, however confounding sociodemographic differences do impact survival outcomes, despite more aggressive and novel treatment approaches provided at HV and APs.",0
"Specific and quantitative analyses of the bioactive components and their metabolites in body fluids are essential to assess the interaction between groups of compounds in dietary supplements and preparations of psychoactives. Reverse-phase LC separations combined with tandem mass spectrometry provide the necessary specificity and sensitivity.

"Leukemia can arise at various stages of the hematopoietic differentiation hierarchy, but the impact of developmental arrest on drug sensitivity is unclear. Applying network-based analyses to single-cell transcriptomes of human B cells, we define genome-wide signaling circuitry for each B cell differentiation stage. Using this reference, we comprehensively map the developmental states of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), revealing its strong correlation with sensitivity to asparaginase, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent. Single-cell multi-omics analyses of primary B-ALL blasts reveal marked intra-leukemia heterogeneity in asparaginase response: resistance is linked to pre-pro-B-like cells, with sensitivity associated with the pro-B-like population. By targeting BCL2, a driver within the pre-pro-B-like cell signaling network, we find that venetoclax significantly potentiates asparaginase efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate a single-cell systems pharmacology framework to predict effective combination therapies based on intra-leukemia heterogeneity in developmental state, with potentially broad applications beyond B-ALL.",0
"The effect of different roasting conditions on antioxidant capacity of phenolics of cashew nuts and their testa was evaluated using several food and biological model systems. Total phenolic content (TPC) of cashew extracts was determined and accelerated oxidative stability of stripped corn oil in the presence of cashew extracts evaluated. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the extracts was assessed in a β-carotene-linoleate and a cooked comminuted pork model system. Inhibition of oxidation of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and stand breaking of supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was also investigated. The TPC ranged from 5 to 791mg gallic acid equivalents/g crude extract. In general, whole cashew nuts and testa extracts demonstrated stronger antioxidant activity than that of the cashew kernel. The inhibition percentage of LDL cholesterol oxidation, as evaluated by conjugated dines formation, of cashew kernels was higher than that of testa and was 69% at the end of 24h incubation. Extracts of roasted cashew nut showed considerable antioxidative efficiency in model systems employed in this study, however, the effect was not significantly (P⩽0.05) different from that of their raw counterparts, except for the accelerated oxidative stability assay. The results suggest that whole cashew nut and testa extracts could be used as a potential source of natural antioxidants in certain food applications and for disease risk reduction.",1

"Anthocyanins and derived components of red wines were determined by microHPLC using a 1 mm ID HPLC column coupled on-line with an MS detector equipped with an ESI (ElectroSpray Ionisation) source. The use of microcolumn HPLC greatly enhanced detection performance, allowing direct identification of components present in the fraction. Nineteen anthocyanins were detected. Fifteen were identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and quantification of components present in a very small amounts.",1
"Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.",1
"Chimeric antigen-receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) is characterised by early phase data at the time of registration, high upfront cost and a complex manufacturing and administration process compared with standard therapies. Our objective was to compare the performance of different models to assess the cost effectiveness of CAR-T using a state-transition model (STM), partitioned survival model (PSM) and discrete event simulation (DES). Individual data for tisagenlecleucel for the treatment of young patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were used to populate the models. Costs and benefits were measured over a lifetime to generate a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Model performance was compared quantitatively on the outcomes generated and a checklist developed summarising the components captured by each model type relevant to assessing cost effectiveness of CAR-T. Models generated similar results with base-case analyses ranging from an incremental cost per QALY of $96,074-$99,625. DES was the only model to specifically capture CAR-T wait time, demonstrating a substantial loss of benefit of CAR-T with increased wait time. Although model type did not meaningfully impact base-case results, the ability to incorporate an outcome-based payment arrangement (OBA) and wait time are important elements to consider when selecting a model for CAR-T. DES provided greater flexibility compared with STM and PSM approaches to deal with the complex manufacturing and administration process that can lead to extended wait times and substantially reduce the benefit of CAR-T. This is an important consideration when selecting a model type for CAR-T, so major drivers of uncertainty are considered in funding decisions.",0
"Pseudo-Chediak-Higashi granules are large cytoplasmic inclusions commonly encountered in myeloblasts or other myeloid precursors in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. However, pseudo-Chediak-Higashi granules are rarely found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We present the case of an 8-year-old boy who was diagnosed with ALL with pseudo-Chediak-Higashi granules in the initial diagnosis and relapse, acting like a characteristic marker.",0
"Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents a continuous challenge for the clinician. Despite recent advances in treatment, the risk of relapse remains significant. The clinical, biological, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics may be different at the time of relapse. Current comprehensive genome sequencing studies suggest that most relapsed patients, especially those with late relapses, acquire new genetic abnormalities, usually within a minor clone that emerges after ALL diagnosis. We report the case of a 23-year-old young woman diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after complete remission. Despite having favorable prognostic factors at diagnosis, the disease relapsed early after allo-HSCT. The cytogenetic and molecular exams at relapse were positive for the Philadelphia chromosome, respectively for the Bcr-Abl transcript. What exactly led to the recurrence of this disease in a more aggressive cytogenetic and molecular form, although there were no predictive elements at diagnosis?",0

"Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO) has helped to change the treatment paradigm in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) but real-world data are limited. The INO-CD22 study is a multicenter retrospective cohort study of adult patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL treated with IO in 24 Italian centers from 2014 to 2019, with the aim of assessing the response, survival, and toxicity of IO. Data for 73 eligible patients were obtained: the median age at the start of IO treatment was 52.7 years (I-III quartiles, 51.9-53.5 years), the median number of previous lines was three (I-III quartiles, two to four), and prior exposure to induction standard chemotherapy and blinatumomab occurred in 85% and 57.5% of cases, respectively. IO was administered following the label schedule. A 74.0% overall response rate was achieved, with a 69.8% complete remission rate and a 4.1% complete remission with incomplete hematologic reconstitution rate. The median duration of response was 4.4 months (I-III quartiles, 2.3-11.2 months). With a median follow-up of 37.2 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 7.9 months (95% CI, 6.08-12.42 months) with a 3- and 5-year OS of 21.2% (95% CI, 11.9%-32.3%) and 5.3% (95% CI, 9.6%-29.8%), respectively. Overall, 37% of patients were able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Eight patients (11.0%) experienced veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome; the most frequent grade ≥3 nonhematologic adverse events were liver toxicities and pneumonia (two grade 4 and one grade 5, respectively). Despite the limitations of retrospective studies, the INO-CD22 study highlights the favorable safety profile and clinical activity of IO within a real-world context.",0
"The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of a PGF Differentiated HMGECs were exposed to latanoprost (0.05 to 50 µg/ml), BAK (0.2 to 200 µg/ml), or combined latanoprost-BAK (0.05-0.2 to 50-200 µg/ml). EP- and FP-type receptors, the cognate receptors of PGE Latanoprost and BAK were found to be lethal to HMGECs at the highest concentrations (p < 0.001 for both). The cytotoxicity of latanoprost was mediated through FP- and EP-independent mechanisms. Both latanoprost and BAK significantly modulated the lipidomic expression of several cholesteryl esters (8% and 30%, respectively) and triacylglycerols (10% and 12%, respectively). The combined latanoprost-BAK agent appeared to be no more toxic and to only negligibly alter the lipid profile relative to its individual components. The use of latanoprost and BAK in glaucoma may alter the viability of the meibomian glands and their lipid expression in vivo. Sublethal concentrations of BAK appear to modulate meibum lipid expression, particularly in relation to sterol biosynthesis. Non-preserved latanoprost had less cytotoxicity at lower doses and fewer lipidomic effects compared to BAK, further strengthening the argument in favor of BAK-free pharmaceutical preparations.",0
"Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various health effects. However their mechanisms of absorption are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of glucose on anthocyanin absorption in rats. We first studied anthocyanin bioavailability in rats that received by gastric intubation approximately 53 micromol cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) equivalents from a red orange extract with or without 2.51 mmol glucose. Neither 24-h urinary anthocyanin excretion nor plasma anthocyanin concentration was significantly affected by simultaneous ingestion of glucose. The influence of glucose (12, 42 or 72 mM) on intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc (pure or from a red orange extract; approximately 12.3 microM) was further studied using an in situ intestinal perfusion model. Absorption of pure Cy 3-glc from the intestinal lumen was not significantly affected by the amount of glucose. However, intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc from the red orange extract (6.49 +/- 1.44%, n = 6) was significantly less than that of pure Cy 3-glc (17.5 +/- 1.3%, n = 7) (p < 0.01) suggesting that the red orange extract contained other components that were able to interfere with Cy 3-glc intestinal absorption. This study has thus shown that glucose did not interfere with anthocyanin glucoside absorption.",1
"The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of high pressure treatments and conventional thermal processing on antioxidant activity, levels of key antioxidant groups (polyphenols, ascorbic acid and anthocyanins) and the colour of strawberry and blackberry purées. Bioactive compounds (cyanidin-3-glycoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activity were measured in strawberry and blackberry purées subjected to high pressure treatment (400, 500, 600 MPa/15 min/10–30 °C) and thermal treatments (70 °C/2 min). Samples were assessed immediately after processing. Different pressure treatments did not cause any significant change in ascorbic acid (p>0.05). In contrast, following thermal processing (P70≥2 min) ascorbic acid degradation was 21% (p<0.05) as compared to unprocessed purée. However, no significant changes in anthocyanins were observed between pressure treated and unprocessed purées (p>0.05), whereas conventional thermal treatments significantly reduced the levels (p<0.05). In general, antioxidant activities of pressure treated strawberry and blackberry purées were significantly higher (p<0.05) than in thermally processed samples. Colour changes were minor (ΔE) for pressurised purées but the differences were slightly higher for thermally treated samples. Redness of purées was well retained in high pressure treated samples. Therefore processing strawberry and blackberry by high pressure processing could be an efficient method to preserve these products quality. Hence high pressure processing (HPP) at moderate temperatures may be appropriate to produce nutritious and fresh like purées.",1
"Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin content, their antioxidant activity, the activity of the fraction containing flavonoids, as well as the activity of l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were studied in the fruit of the hot pepper Capsicum annuum L., var. Cyklon and Bronowicka Ostra. For analyses, pericarps of fruit at two stages were used: before the beginning of maturation — green; and mature — red. The fruit of the cv. Bronowicka Ostra was characterized by a higher PAL activity, capsaicinoid level and higher antioxidant activity than that found in Cyklon. It was found that red fruit of both cultivars had higher antioxidant activity in the capsaicinoid and flavonoid fractions. The PAL activity was as much higher in the red than in the green (unripe) fruits. The antioxidant activity under the same experimental conditions was similar in both capsaicinoid and flavonoid fractions of cv. Bronowicka Ostra.",1

The disease was refractory to the first cycle of induction chemotherapy. However, after the second induction, cytological remission was achieved. Nevertheless, minimal residual disease (MRD) positivity persisted (IGH rearrangement detected by PCR) after the first consolidation therapy, giving indication for a stem cell transplantation (SCT). Thirty days post-transplant, no MRD was detected, and complete chimerism was measured for the months following transplantation. However, the patient died in the context of severe graft-versus-host disease and infectious complications 6 months after the SCT. This case highlights the importance of detailed molecular analysis in the initial diagnostics of ALL.

"The total contents of phenolic acids measured by high-performance liquid-chromatography were 5–8 mg/litre in beers brewed in Ireland whereas 16–40 mg/litre were present in four other beers. In all beers the predominant phenolic acids were vanillic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids. Free phenolic acids were extracted from Emma barley grains and malt in very small amounts (15–28 mg/kg) but larger quantities (191 mg/kg) were released on mashing the malt. Little change occurred in the contents of phenolic acids on processing a lager wort through to the finished beer. Treatment with excess Polyclar AT removed astringent flavour and phenolic acids from an experimental ale but this flavour loss could not be accounted for by the adsorption of phenolic acids. The flavour threshold for a nine-component phenolic acid mixture in lager was between 50 mg/litre and 100 mg/litre.",1

Little change occurs in the quantities of these compounds in immature, threshhold mature and mature fruit during storage at 0°C with subsequent ripening at 20°C. HPLC analysis determined that small but significant changes occur in the quantities of epicatechin in the threshold mature and mature fruit during storage and in the quantities of cyanidin in the immature fruit.

"L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) is crucial in treating pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but its use is hampered by side effects from the immunogenicity and L-glutaminase (L-GLNase) co-activity of FDA-approved bacterial L-ASNases, often leading to treatment discontinuation and poor outcomes. The toxicity of these L-ASNases makes them especially challenging to use in adult cancer patients. To overcome these issues, we developed EBD-200, a humanized guinea pig L-ASNase with low Km and no L-GLNase activity, eliminating glutamine-related toxicity. EBD-200 showed comparable anti-cancer effects to PEGylated L-ASNase in ASNS",0
"The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.",1
"Acute leukemia is a bone marrow-related disease characterized by fast progression and the production of immature blood cells rather than normal ones that are classified as either acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chemotherapy as a conventional treatment has many side effects, thus new medications that target intracellular molecules and cell surface markers on leukemic cells have been developed in the last decades. This review focuses on antibody-based targeted treatments, which so far, have been shown to improve the treatment outcomes, including the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), monoclonal antibodies, and bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTE). Other classes are small molecule inhibitors (as a new generation of chemotherapeutic drugs in targeted therapies) that are discussed herein include SMIs of intracellular target molecules, including tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, BCL-2, and smoothened (SMO). These inhibitors have been very effective in dealing with certain genetic changes besides blocking the important cell molecules in acute leukemia responsible for the failure of the immune system. A focus is made on assessing the use of antibody-mediated therapies in combination with SMIs for treating acute leukemia. Given the distinct mechanisms and objectives of these two therapeutic modalities that have the potential to synergistically enhance one another, along with the findings from clinical trial investigations, it appears that combination therapy may yield superior efficacy compared to monotherapy, representing a progressive advancement in the treatment of acute leukemia.",0
"To explore the clinical characteristics, treatment, and prognosis of patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm(BPDCN).

"To investigate the possible risk factors for death at post-treatment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A multivariate competing risk analysis was performed to retrospectively analyze the data of children with ALL who died after treatment with CCCG-ALL-2015 in China and to determine the possible risk factors for death at post-treatment in children with ALL. Age at the first diagnosis of ≥10 years; final risk level of high-risk; D19 minimal residual disease (MRD) (≥0.01%) and D46 MRD (≥0.01%); genetic abnormalities, such as KMT2A-rearrangement, c-Myc rearrangement, and PDGFRB rearrangement; and the presence of CNS3 (all P values, <0.05) were identified as independent risk factors, whereas the risk level at the first diagnosis of low-risk (LR) and ETV6::RUNX1 positivity was considered as independent protective factors of death in children with ALL. Among the 471 cases of death, 45 cases were treated with CCCG-ALL-2015 only, and 163 (34.61%) were treatment-related, with 62.42% due to severe infections. 55.83% of treatment-related mortality (TRM) occurred in the early phase of treatment (induction phase). TRM has a significant impact on the overall survival of pediatric patients with ALL.

"Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity.

Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed plums.",1
"The potential influence of a preoperative anterolateral ligament (ALL) lesion seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the mid- and long-term surgical outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is still controversial. To evaluate the clinical outcomes and failure rate of isolated ACL reconstruction at a minimum 5-year follow-up in patients with and without ALL injury diagnosed preoperatively using MRI. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. A prospective cohort of patients with acute ACL injury was divided into 2 groups based on the presence (ALL injury group) or absence (control group) of ALL injury on preoperative MRI. This is a longer-term follow-up study of a previously published study that had a minimum 2-year follow-up. Both groups underwent anatomic isolated reconstruction of the ACL. The Lysholm and subjective International Knee Documentation Committee scores, KT-1000 arthrometer and pivot-shift tests, reconstruction failure rate, incidence of contralateral ACL injury, presence of associated meniscal injury, and presence of knee hyperextension were evaluated. The evaluation at the 5-year follow-up was also compared with the same patient's evaluation at 2 years of follow-up. A total of 156 patients were evaluated. No significant differences were found between the groups in the preoperative evaluation. In the postoperative evaluation, patients in the ALL injury group had a higher reconstruction failure rate (14.3% vs 4.6% for the control group; Combined ACL and ALL injuries were associated with significantly less favorable outcomes than were isolated ACL injuries at a minimum follow-up of 5 years after isolated ACL reconstruction with hamstring autograft. Patients with concomitant ALL injury showed a higher failure rate and worse functional scores. Also, knee stability tended to slightly worsen from 2 to 5 years in cases of associated ALL injury.",0
"Total and free phenolic contents of 16 commonly consumed fruits (comprising 9 apples, 4 pears, and one each of peach, plum, and kiwi fruit cultivars) were measured by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Total phenol contents varied from 272 to 475 mg of CtE/100 g of fresh weight. Of the apple cultivars studied, Braeburn and Empire had the highest and lowest total phenol content, respectively. The apple cultivars ranked in the following decreasing order: Braeburn > Red Delicious > Crisp Pink > Granny Smith > Royal Gala > Bramley > Golden Delicious > Fuji > Empire. Among pear cultivars, the order was Forelle > Taylor's > Peckham's > Conference. Peach and plum equally had high contents. The percentage of conjugated phenolics ranged between 3 (Red Delicious) and 77% (Empire) of the total phenols. Comparison of different cultivars of the same fruit and between different fruits showed broad variations in both phenolic content and in vitro antioxidant activity; a weak correlation (R(2) = 0.58) was observed between the phenolic content of the fruits and the total antioxidant activity, as estimated by the FRAP assay. The calculated dietary intake of total, free, and conjugated phenols from average per capita consumption of apples and pears in different regions of the U.K. varied between 104-126, 53-64, and 51-62 mg of CtE/day, respectively.",1
"The effects of industrial tomato paste processing and long-term (12 months) ambient storage on the content and stability of quercetin, kaempferol, ascorbic acid (AA), dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA), β-carotene and lycopene were evaluated in a commercially produced tomato paste.",1
"Buckwheat seeds (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) were milled into 23 fractions: seven fine flours, three coarse flours, four small semolina, two big semolina, six bran, and one husk fraction. A considerable variation in gross chemical composition was found among the milling fractions. The protein content varied from 4.4 to 11.9% (db) in flours and from 19.2 to 31.3% in bran fractions; starch varied from 91.7 to 70.4% in flours and from 42.6 to 20.3 in bran. The percentage of soluble dietary fiber contained in total dietary fiber was higher in flours than in semolina and bran fractions. Ash, Fe, P, tannin, phytate content, and color were also investigated. A unique distribution of phytate was found in starch. Correlation is significantly positive in husk, bran, and semolina fractions, while correlation is significantly negative in flour fractions. Depending on technological or nutritional demands, appropriate fractions may be chosen to achieve the desired end-use product.",1
"Biochanin A (BCA) is a dietary isoflavone present in legumes, most notably red clover, and in many herbal dietary supplements. BCA has been reported to have chemopreventive properties and is metabolized to the isoflavone genistein (GEN), BCA conjugates, and GEN conjugates. The metabolites may contribute to the chemopreventive effects of BCA. The absorption, metabolism, and disposition of BCA have not been determined in rats. Our objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered BCA by intravenous injection (1 and 5 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal injection (5 and 50 mg/kg), and orally (5 and 50 mg/kg). Plasma and bile samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed in vitro to determine conjugate concentrations for BCA and GEN. Equilibrium dialysis was used to determine protein binding. The BCA and GEN concentrations in plasma, urine, and bile were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters of BCA were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. Significant levels of BCA conjugates and GEN conjugates were detected in plasma and bile. Both BCA and GEN were found to have a high clearance and a large apparent volume of distribution; the bioavailability of both was poor (<4%). Reentry peaks were evident after oral administration of both BCA and GEN, suggesting enterohepatic cycling. The free fraction of BCA in rat plasma was 1.5%. A 2-compartment model that included both linear and nonlinear clearance terms and enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first evaluation of the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats.",1
"A sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has been developed and validated for the quantification of taxifolin in rat plasma. Following liquid/liquid extraction by ethyl acetate, the analytes were separated on a Sunfire (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 3.5 microm) column and analyzed in the selected ion recording with a negative electrospray ionization mode. The method was linear over the concentration range of 6-6750 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precisions were all within 8% and accuracy ranged from 92.9% to 105.1%. The lower limit of quantification was 6 ng/mL. The present method was successfully applied to the estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of taxifolin following intravenous and oral administration to rats. The absolute bioavailability of taxifolin was 0.17% in rat.",1
"Leukaemias and lymphomas are among the most prevalent and significant cancers in Australasia and Oceania. This study aims to examine the burden of leukaemias/lymphomas and its temporal trend in Australasia and Oceania from 2010 to 2019. Epidemiological study METHODS: Data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 were used to examine the burden of leukaemia/lymphoma key subtypes (acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), Hodgkin-lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)) by sex and 5 year age groups (from <5 years to 85 years+), in terms of incidence, prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths. Estimated average percentage changes were calculated to assess the temporal trends of leukaemia/lymphoma burden (incidence/prevalence/DALYs/deaths) from 2010 to 2019 in Australasia and Oceania. AML and NHL were the leading causes of leukaemia/lymphoma burden in both regions. Age-standardised rates (ASRs) for AML versus NHL in Australasia were: incidence 4.72 versus 19.06, DALYs 89.01 versus 161.68 and deaths 4.15 versus 8.02 per 100 000 population. ASRs for AML versus NHL in Oceania were: incidence 1.36 versus 1.08, DALYs 49.16 versus 38.30 and deaths 0.91 versus 0.98 per 100 000 population. From 2010 to 2019, Australasia observed an increasing trend in incidence/prevalence/deaths across most leukaemias/lymphomas and increasing/stable trend in DALYs for AML/CLL/NHL, while Oceania observed increasing trends in incidence/prevalence/DALYs for CLL/NHL and stable trends in all outcomes (except for prevalence (stable)) for AML. Contrasting mortality trends for ALL/CML/HL were observed between the two regions (increasing/stable in Australasia and decreasing in Oceania). Statistically significant differences were observed in disease burden trends between sexes, with males experiencing a greater increase (or smaller decrease) in the burden for AML in both regions. Different temporal trends in leukaemia/lymphoma burden observed in two closely situated geographic regions with different sociodemographic indices highlight the necessity for region-specific intervention strategies to enhance the access to innovative disease treatments, reducing leukaemia/lymphoma burden.",0
"Total body irradiation (TBI) is a pivotal part of conditioning prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), yet evidence is sparse regarding the effect of TBI delivery techniques on acute and late toxicities. In a national cohort of pediatric HSCT-recipients, we compared three TBI schedules; 12 Gray (Gy) delivered as (i) 4 Gy daily fractions from 2008 to 2011 (n = 12); (ii) 2 Gy fractions twice daily with two-dimensional (2D) planning technology from 2012 to 2015 (n = 16); and (iii) 2 Gy twice daily with three-dimensional (3D) planning intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) from 2016 to 2020 (n = 14). The 5-year event-free survival was 75.0%, 81.3%, and 81.3% in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Acute toxicity assessed as maximum ferritin and C-reactive protein during the first 3 months post HSCT did not differ between cohorts, nor did the time to first hospital discharge (median 28, 32, and 31 days, p = .25). The incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (66%, 56%, 71%) and chronic GvHD (25%, 31%, 14%) were comparable. Pulmonary function assessed by spirometry did not differ significantly. The 5-year cataract-free survival was 33.3%, 79%, and 100% in Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We found a nonsignificant tendency toward more endocrinopathies in Cohort 1 compared to Cohorts 2 and 3. The change of modality did not result in more relapses. More fractionation led to improvement with a lower incidence of cataract and a tendency toward fewer endocrinopathies. The effect of 3D-planning-IMRT technology requires further evaluation in larger studies.",0
"Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.",1
"Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a life-threatening neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency, commonly associated with alcoholism but also observed in malnourished pediatric cancer patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. WE remains underdiagnosed in children, with many cases only confirmed postmortem. We report a 6-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who developed WE secondary to treatment-resistant nausea and vomiting. The patient presented with acute gait disturbance, ophthalmoparesis, and paraparesis following persistent vomiting and significant weight loss. Initial diagnostic evaluations, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging, suggested alternative diagnoses such as cerebellitis and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. However, progressive neurological deterioration, the emergence of encephalopathy, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of hyperintense lesions in the periventricular, periaqueductal, and cerebellar regions supported the diagnosis of WE. The overlapping features with other neurological conditions contributed to a delay in recognizing WE and initiating thiamine therapy. Despite initiating high-dose intravenous thiamine, symptom resolution was significant but partial. Unfortunately, the patient later developed lymphomatous meningitis and sepsis and ultimately succumbed to complications. This case highlights the importance of early clinical recognition of WE in pediatric leukemia patients with prolonged vomiting, as delayed diagnosis can lead to irreversible neurological damage or death. Given the limitations of early neuroimaging findings, clinical suspicion should prompt immediate thiamine supplementation. The report points out the need for heightened awareness of thiamine deficiency in pediatric oncology, emphasizing the role of prophylactic supplementation in high-risk patients.",0
"Antibiotics are frequently prescribed in preschool wheezing episodes and acute asthma exacerbations (AAEs), even though antibiotics are not recommended as standard AAE treatment. To systematically present relevant literature about the clinical effects of antibiotics for AAE and conclude with recommendations. Systematic search was conducted in Medline ALL, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Primary outcomes included AAE duration and length of hospital stay, while secondary outcomes incorporated AAE severity, treatment failure, AAE recurrence risk, spirometry, health costs, and adverse events. Randomised controlled trials and cohort studies were included if they investigated the clinical effect of antibiotics in AAE compared to placebo/standard care. Fifteen studies were included. Evidence for clinical effects of antibiotics in AAE treatment is scarce. Macrolides seem to shorten AAE duration in children; for adults, there is a lack of data. Antibiotics were associated with a longer hospital admission in retrospective observational studies, without evidence in randomised trials. Procalcitonin-guided treatment led to a reduction of antibiotic prescriptions without adverse outcomes. Limited evidence is available that macrolides shorten AAE duration in preschool wheezers. For other age groups, there is no clear evidence of beneficial effects of antibiotics.",0
"This study aimed to evaluate the cost-utility analyses of blinatumomab in children with relapsed/refractory B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) compared to Consolidation Chemotherapy in Iran. Based on the results of the phase III randomized 20120215 trial (NCT02393859) the cost-utility analysis, was evaluated over a lifetime using the Parietal Survival model with three health states. The model considered both direct and indirect costs from a societal perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by determining the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Costs and QALYs were discounted annually at 5.8% and 5%, respectively. Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed to assess the model's robustness. The study estimated that blinatumomab is a cost-effective treatment option, with a probability of 57.2%. Blinatumomab was associated with a higher cost ($42,481 versus $21,355) and higher QALYs gained (13.14 versus 8.06) compared to Consolidation Chemotherapy with an ICER of USD 4,160, which is below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 4,210 USD in Iran. Blinatumomab is a cost-effective treatment strategy for pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-ALL from an Iranian societal perspective. This study looked at the costs and benefits of using a medicine called blinatumomab to treat children in Iran who have a difficult-to-treat form of blood cancer called B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL). Researchers compared blinatumomab to a standard treatment known as consolidation chemotherapy. Using data from a large clinical trial, they created a model to estimate how much the treatments would cost and how much they would improve patients’ lives. The model included both medical costs and other costs that affect families and society. It also measured improvements in health by looking at “quality-adjusted life years,” which reflect both how long and how well people live. The results showed that although blinatumomab costs more than the standard treatment, it also helps patients live longer and healthier lives. Overall, the study found that blinatumomab offers good value for money and is a cost-effective option for treating this type of leukemia in children in Iran.",0
"Conflicting data exist on the impact of mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) compared to matched unrelated donor (MUD) in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy), highlighting the need for disease-specific research. We conducted a retrospective analysis of donor characteristics in 350 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete remission (CR) who received 8/8 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched MUD and 7/8 HLA-matched MMUD. The primary endpoint was leukemia-free survival (LFS). The median age was 37 years (range, 18-76), with 231 (66%) in first CR, and 280 (80%) diagnosed with B-cell ALL. The median donor age was 28 years (range, 18-57), with 237 (68%) MUD and 113 (32%) MMUD. The use of MUD or MMUD did not have a significant impact on LFS or other transplant outcomes. Among other donorrelated variables, CMV-negative donor for a CMV-negative recipient was associated with improved LFS (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.32-0.96) and overall survival (HR 0.52; 95% CI 0.28-1), while older donor age showed an increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade III-IV (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.64) and female donor to male recipient combination increased the risk of grade II-IV acute GvHD (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.05-3). In conclusion, non-HLA donor characteristics rather than HLA matching should be prioritized to guide unrelated donor selection for ALL patients in the PTCy HCT setting.",0
"To report the clinical and histopathological features of a case of bullous retinal detachment, hypopyon, and optic disc swelling in a patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL). A 65-year-old Japanese woman presented with bilateral blurry vision. Four years earlier, she had been diagnosed with Ph + ALL and received chemotherapy. At initial examination, optical coherence tomography revealed subretinal detachment resembling central serous chorioretinopathy. A similar finding had been detected 1 month earlier during the remission phase, when the patient visited a clinic. Subretinal detachment resolved after systemic chemotherapy. Five months later, while in complete remission, she developed unilateral iritis and elevated intraocular pressure in the right eye, which improved with topical steroid treatment. Ten months after the initial presentation, she returned with decreased vision in both eyes. A slit-lamp examination revealed hypopyon uveitis in the right eye. Fundus examination revealed bilateral bullous retinal detachment and optic disc swelling, which was more pronounced in the right eye. At the same time, a bone marrow biopsy confirmed relapse of ALL. Therefore, systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy was initiated; however, her condition deteriorated, and she died 2 weeks later. Autopsy revealed widespread leukemic infiltration throughout the ocular tissues, resulting in multiple ocular manifestations. The findings suggested that ocular infiltration occurred either hematogenously or through direct extension from the meninges. Leukemic infiltration of the eye was pathologically confirmed in a patient with Ph + ALL who developed ocular manifestations during the remission phase. Ocular evaluation is essential for confirming ocular relapse of ALL, and patients should be closely monitored to enable early detection and timely intervention.",0
"Four varieties of green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) were analyzed for flavonol composition and content. Two flavonol conjugates, not previously reported in green bean, were found in three of the varieties. These are quercetin 3-O-(2G-β-d-xylopyranosylrutinoside) (1), (1.0−2.0 μg/g of fresh weight) and the corresponding kaempferol analogue (2) (0.3−0.7 μg/g). The major flavonol component in all of the varieties was quercetin 3-O-glucuronopyranoside (3) (3.5−15.1 μg/g) with lesser amounts of quercetin 3-O-rutinoside (4) (0.2−4.3 μg/g) and kaempferol 3-O-glucuronopyranoside (5) (0.5−1.3 μg/g). Kaempferol rutinoside (6) was detected in only one variety (0.8 μg/g). Commercial processing, such as canning, did not result in chemical breakdown of the conjugates, although between 8.8 and 24.4%, depending on the conjugate, was leached into the cooking water.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemias are the most common malignancies in childhood. Although its etiology is still unclear, it is thought that disorders in oxidative stress metabolism may contribute to leukemogenesis. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed as a result of the non-enzymatic binding of sugars to biomolecules. Oxidation reactions are triggered through AGE-Receptor (RAGE) interaction, resulting in the formation of reactive oxygen species. These can play crucial roles in cancer pathogenesis and leukemogenesis. It is thought that sRAGE (soluble RAGE) is the end product of glycation and circulates freely in the circulation by binding to RAGE ligands. We investigate novel leukemia biomarkers and focus on soluble RAGE (sRAGE) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis and prognosis. Thirty children (1-17 years) diagnosed with ALL were included in the study. Patients were divided into standard, medium, and high risk groups according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) treatment protocol. Patients were evaluated twice; at the time of diagnosis and at the sixth month of remission. sRAGE and blood parameters were compared with healthy controls (",0
"Resveratrol is a substance of a natural character, naturally present in some foods, namely in wine. The grape peels of Vitis vinifera contain about 50 to 100 mg of resveratrol/g and the average resveratrol concentration in red wines produced in the world fluctuates between 1.0 to 3.0 mg/l. A few biological activities were discovered with resveratrol in the last few years such as positive action against some cardiovascular diseases described as so called French paradox and anti-cancer chemo-preventive activity. The denominators of those activities are anti-oxidizing and free radical scavenging features of resveratrol molecule. As expected, red wines from vines originating in the Czech vineyard regions appear to contain relatively high levels of resveratrol (from 1.4 to 9.4 mg/l.",1
"T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a rare lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by T lymphocyte heterogeneity and diverse genetic abnormalities, accounting for approximately 15 % of childhood leukemias. BETd-246 serves as a tethering agent that links BETi-211 to thalidomide for the development of BET degraders. This compound has demonstrated superior efficacy in tumor treatment compared with traditional BET inhibitors. However, the anti-tumor effects and molecular mechanisms underlying the action of BETd-246 in T-ALL remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to investigate the anti-tumor effects of BETd-246 and provide new insights into treatment strategies for T-ALL. In human T-ALL cell lines, BETd-246 induced degradation of BET proteins, particularly BRD4, at nanomolar concentrations. It effectively inhibited cell growth, disrupted the cell cycle, and promoted apoptosis in T-ALL cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of BETd-246 were more pronounced than those of JQ1. In vivo experiments revealed that treatment with BETd-246 reduced proliferation and invasion of T-ALL cells and extended survival time in mouse models. RNA sequencing analysis indicated significant downregulation of T-cell receptor (TCR)-associated transmembrane adaptor 1 (TRAT1) expression in T-ALL cells treated with BETd-246. Knocking down TRAT1 resulted in increased growth inhibition and enhanced apoptosis within these cells. These findings suggest that TRAT1 plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of BETd-246 in T-ALL. Overall, our results indicate that BETd-246 is a promising therapeutic agent for treating this aggressive form of leukemia.",0
"Lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens, produced from plant precursors by colonic bacteria, may protect against certain cancers. We examined the effects of flaxseed consumption on urinary lignans and isoflavonoids. Eighteen women consumed their usual omnivorous diets for three menstrual cycles and their usual diets supplemented with flaxseed powder (10 g/d) for three cycles in a randomized crossover design. Three-day urine samples from follicular and luteal phases were analyzed for lignans and isoflavonoids by isotope-dilution gas chromatography--mass spectrometry. Excretion of the lignans enterodiol and enterolactone increased with flaxseed from 1.09 +/- 1.08 and 3.16 +/- 1.47 to 19.48 +/- 1.10 and 27.79 +/- 1.50 mumol/d, respectively (P < 0.0002). Enterodiol and enterolactone excretion varied among subjects in response to flaxseed (3- to 285-fold increase). There were no differences in excretion of isoflavonoids (daidzein, genistein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) or the lignan matairesinol with flaxseed. Excretion was not altered by phase of menstrual cycle or duration of flaxseed consumption.",1
"Polyphenolic components, such as anthraquinones and stilbenes, from species of the genus Rheum have been shown to have a range of bioactivities relevant to human health. This paper outlines the polyphenolic composition of edible petioles of garden rhubarb (Rheum rhapontigen) and describes the effects of common cooking methods on total polyphenolic content, anthocyanin content and total antioxidant capacity. Most cooking regimes (fast stewing, slow stewing and baking) except blanching increased total polyphenol content and overall antioxidant capacity, compared to the raw material. The patterns of anthocyanin content and total polyphenol content between the different cooking regimes suggested a balance between two processes; cooking facilitated the release of polyphenol compounds from the rhubarb but also caused breakdown of the released compounds. Baking and slow stewing offered the best maintenance of colour through preservation of anthocyanin and the highest antioxidant capacity. Baking for 20min provided well-cooked rhubarb with the highest antioxidant capacity and the highest anthocyanin content, which is important for the aesthetic quality of the dish. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometric (LC–MS) analysis putatively identified over 40 polyphenol components in raw rhubarb, including anthraquinone, stilbene, anthocyanin and flavonol derivatives. Baking caused selective effects on the stability of the different polyphenol components. Initially, the yield of all components increased but there was a drastic decline in the relative stability of anthraquinone aglycones with increasing cooking time and initial evidence for the turnover of other anthraquinone derivatives was obtained.",1
"Many studies have investigated patients' understandings of how to optimise mental health services. However, only a few studies in the Italian context have involved experts by experience (EbEs), who can be ex-users, family members of ex-users or current service collaborators. Their role is crucial in implementing collaborative service quality assessment projects. The study investigated the experience of 35 EbEs,  users, and family members who carried out a 9-month fortnightly project aimed at imagining an 'ideal service'. The facilitators of the discussion groups (two EbEs) were interviewed; written reports of each meeting were produced with relevant comments, notes and specific suggestions; and content analysis was applied. The most important result concerns the effectiveness of the project management method and group leadership carried out by the two EbEs. This approach allowed for complete autonomy of the work, without professional gaze or power imbalance. Also, the ideas and specific contents focused on by the two groups offer strategies to facilitate users' entry and reception in health care centres, to reduce the stigma of mental illness, to improve the centres' physical environment, to improve organisational aspects, to keep family members actively involved and to network mental health services with other territorial services. EbEs have proven to be key figures in ensuring equity of role in the service co-design process. This also concerns a context, the Italian one, where their role has not yet been recognised and legalised. Their contribution and ideas to improve services could be fundamental not only in mental health centres, but also in other health facilities, and could concern the entire service delivery process rather than being limited to quality assurance, according to a virtuous circle based on active participation and transformation of the role of users. This work resulted from close collaboration between the two EbEs who conducted the groups, users and family members, the university, and the psychiatrist in charge of the service. All of them contributed to the research. The EbEs, researchers and psychiatrist participated in the interpretation of the data and are the co-authors of this paper.",0
"LINC00652 plays pivotal roles in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) a heterogeneous hematological malignancy. Here, we investigated the potential regulatory mechanisms of LINC00652 in ALL. Genome-wide association study data for LINC00652 were obtained for Mendelian randomization and integrated with RNA sequencing data, Bioinformatics analyses, including weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Spearman or Pearson correlation analysis, function, immune microenvironment, subcellular localization, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network construction, were employed explore the potential mechanisms of LINC00652 in ALL. LINC00652 exhibited no significant causal relationship with ALL but was identified as a protective factor ( LINC00652 May protect against ALL and influence its pathogenesis through ceRNA mechanisms.",0
"The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due to the removal of the brown skin.

"Zhengsui Wan (ZSW) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine formula for treating Acute Lymphatic Leukemia (ALL) in our institution, and it has shown potential efficacy. However, its mechanism of action (MoA) remains unclear. In this study, we systematically explored the ZSW in ALL (in vitro and in vivo) using network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques. Mass spectrometry was conducted to analyze possible active components in ZSW. BALB/c mice were treated by ZSW aqueous decoction, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were extracted for proteomic analysis to evaluate differentially expressed proteins. Moreover, proteins associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in SwissTargetPrediction and GeneCards databases were screened, and they intersected with differentially expressed proteins to obtain potential targets for ZSW. Protein interactions were constructed for the selected targets. Then, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analysis on its basis and screened the core target through K-core. We validated it by molecular docking with the top three actives in the molecular network in degree value. Finally, we detected the regulation of ICAM1 in MSCs by ZSW by qRT-PCR. We detected 182 active ingredients in ZSW and identified 725 differential proteins in ZSWtreated mice, of which 25 were potential targets. Furthermore, MMP2, ICAM1, PSEN1, SLC9A1, and MMP14 were identified as core targets using the PPI network and K-core screening. Moreover, ZSW significantly downregulated ICAM1 expression in MSCs. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that the results of ZSW were coordinated through immunomodulatory, inflammation-related, and drug resistance-related genes, including the PI3K-Akt, cAMP, and Wnt signaling pathways. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated moderate binding capacity between the active compounds and the screened target. In this study, we successfully identified possible active ingredients and predicted potential targets and pathways for ZSW for the treatment of ALL. We provide a new strategy for further research on the molecular basis of ZSW biological effects in ALL. In addition, the potential active ingredients could provide new leads for drug discovery in ALL investigations.",0
"Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.",1
"Despite remarkable improvements in the survival of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), sensitive detection and clinical management of central nervous system leukemia (CNSL) are still immensely challenging. Blast cells residing in the CNS but not circulating in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remain undetected by current diagnostic methods, preventing a truly risk-adapted anti-leukemic treatment in this compartment. We examined the clinical applicability of the molecular marker microRNA (miR)-181a quantified in the cell-free CSF to evaluate the level of CNS involvement and to optimize patient stratification based on CNS status. Normalized copy number of miR-181a was longitudinally profiled using droplet digital PCR, and the results were compared with the degree of leukemic involvement of the CNS. After combining cytospin- and flow cytometry (FCM) data with miR-181a expression, we could stratify previously ambiguous cases and reclassify patients into a CNS-positive/miR-significant group (mean ± SE for miR-181a copies: 3300.70 ± 809.69) bearing remarkable infiltration as well as into CNS-minimal/miR-significant and CNS-minimal/miR-minimal groups differentiating putative, clinically significant occult CNSL cases (2503.50 ± 275.89 and 744.02 ± 86.81 copies, respectively, p = 1.13 × 10",0
"Dietary supplements manufactured from red clover are widely marketed to provide the beneficial health effects of isoflavones without changing the original diet. In this study the metabolism of formononetin and biochanin A, the principal isoflavones of red clover, was studied in human subjects. Seven women ingested four red clover dietary supplements, and the metabolites of the isoflavones were identified in their urine samples. The structures of trimethylsilyl derivatives of the metabolites were established by GC-MS. New reduced metabolites of formononetin (dihydroformononetin and angolensin) and biochanin A (dihydrobiochanin A and 6'-hydroxyangolensin) were identified in urine samples using authentic reference compounds. Possible metabolic pathways are presented for the red clover isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A.",1
"In this retrospective study, with prolonged follow-up, we analyze the outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the impact of pre-transplantation measurable residual disease (pre-HSCT MRD). Detection of MRD was performed by multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) for Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL (Ph-neg ALL) and by classic genetic tests for Ph-pos ALL. Among 46 patients in first complete remission (CR1) who had available MRD data, 1- and 3-year cumulative incidences of relapse (CIR) for patients with positive and negative MRD were 47.1% and 52.9% vs. 3.4% and 6.9%, respectively (p<0.001). Disease free survival (DFS) at 1 and 3 years was 82.8% (95% CI 70.1-97.7) and 79.3% (95% CI 65.9-95.5) in the negative MRD group and 35.3% (95% CI 18.5-67.2) and 29.4% (95% CI 14.1-61.4) in the positive MRD group (p<0.001). With a median follow up of 29 months in the entire cohort and 177.6 months (14.8 years) in survivors, 1- and 3-year overall survival (OS) for the pre-HSCT negative MRD group was 82.8% (95% CI 70.1-97.7) and 79.2% (95% CI 65.6-95.5), respectively, compared to 64.7% (95% CI 45.5-91.9) and 41.2% (95% CI 23.3-72.7) in the positive MRD group (p=0.001). In a multivariate model, positive pre-HSCT MRD is associated with increased CIR and poorer DFS and OS. These results support that pre-HSCT MRD should be eradicated to improve survival of adult ALL patients who undergo allo-HSCT.",0
"The stability of the major flavonol glucosides and anthocyanins was studied in two regional varieties of Portuguese onion (a white variety “branca da Póvoa” and a red variety “vermelha da Póvoa”). White and red onions from 2007 and 2008 harvests were subjected to field curing with and without light, but the red cultivar from 2008 was also subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping and different cooking treatments. Field curing resulted in increases in quercetin content compared to levels at lifting, especially important for all white bulbs (33–40% increase). Flavonol and anthocyanin levels in onions cured in the dark were similar to those obtained in bulbs cured in the light. The treatments chopping followed by refrigerated storage, oven roasting and frying, did practically not contribute to modify the total levels of flavonols. Moderate microwave cooking did not affect to the flavonol content, but intense microwave treatment cause flavonol losses of 16% and 18% for quercetin 3,4′-diglucoside (QdG) and quercetin 4′-glucoside (QmG), respectively. Boiling onions for 30min leaded losses of quercetin glycosides, which leached to the boiling water without being degraded at 37% and 29% for QdG and QmG, respectively. Boiling for 60min had more severe effects, since it caused the degradation of quercetin derivatives at 53% and 44% for QdG and QmG, respectively. For anthocyanins, the severity of the cooking treatments was in the following order: frying>boiling>roasting (microwave roasting>oven roasting).",1
"The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine (Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity optimization.",1
"Phenolic compounds are important for their astringent taste and as antioxidants in health. Green, oolong and black tea and an instant coffee were each diluted 50 times in a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer and, along with phenolic standards, were analysed by cyclic voltammetry at a carbon electrode. Standards with a pyrogallol group (gallocatechins) were strong reducing agents and produced a peak at 90–120 mV, while those with a catechol or gallate group peaked at 180–220 mV. The response of green and oolong teas was dominated by epigallocatechin gallate, and levels determined by HPLC were consistent with the electrochemical response. Black tea behaved like a theaflavin extract, and coffee like 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both with peaks at around 230 mV. The level of phenolics increased with water temperature from 20 to 100 °C, while lower levels were obtained for repeat infusions. The addition of milk (skim or full-fat alike) lowered the response more in the teas than in the coffee.",1
A fast method using high-performance liquid chromatography based on two monolithic columns has been developed for the simultaneous determination of isoflavones extracted from soybeans and derived foods. The 12 main isoflavones were resolved in 10 min in two coupled monolithic columns working at 35 degrees C using a elution gradient of acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) and methanol (0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 5 mL min(-1). Retention time and relative area standard deviations were below 1% for all isoflavones. The method developed was successfully applied to several soy food samples and spiked samples. Total isoflavone concentration in sampled soy foods ranged from 34.28 mg L(-1) to 4.29 mg g(-1).,1

"Acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a common malignancy in children. Patients with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are at a higher risk of developing hematologic disorders. Despite advances in treatment, extramedullary relapse remains a challenge, particularly when it manifests as spinal cord compression leading to paraplegia, a rare but severe complication. We describe the clinical course of an 11-year-old male with Trisomy 21, diagnosed with B-ALL. The patient was treated with standard chemotherapy (VDLP regimen) followed by central nervous system prophylaxis through lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy. Despite achieving minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status, the patient developed progressive lower back pain and acute paraplegia. Imaging studies and subsequent spinal surgery were performed to diagnose and manage the spinal cord lesion. The patient's spinal pathology confirmed a relapse of B-ALL with extramedullary involvement. Immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed markers consistent with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Chemotherapy-induced remission was initially achieved, but the patient experienced bone marrow suppression after each cycle, leading to further hospitalization and supportive treatments. Postsurgical findings showed no CNS involve-ment, and bone marrow MRD remained negative. This case highlights the complexity of managing B-ALL in children with Trisomy 21, who may be prone to extramedullary relapse despite systemic remission. Early recognition of spinal symptoms and prompt surgical intervention are critical in preventing irreversible neurological damage such as paraplegia. This case underscores the need for vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in high-risk populations.",0

"Acute lymphocytic leukemia is a hematological malignancy that primarily affects children. Long-term chemotherapy is effective, but always causes different toxic side effects. With the application of a chemotherapy-free treatment strategy, we intend to demonstrate the most recent results of using one type of epigenetic drug, histone deacetylase inhibitors, in ALL and to provide preclinical evidence for further clinical trials. In this review, we found that panobinostat (LBH589) showed positive outcomes as a monotherapy, whereas vorinostat (SAHA) was a better choice for combinatorial use. Preclinical research has identified chidamide as a potential agent for investigation in more clinical trials in the future. In conclusion, histone deacetylase inhibitors play a significant role in the chemotherapy-free landscape in cancer treatment, particularly in acute lymphocytic leukemia.",0

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment, involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and pharmacotherapy (antibiotics, antineoplastics) perturbs the gut microbiota in pediatric patients, with enduring effects post-treatment. ALL treatments diminish microbial richness and diversity, favoring pathogenic bacteria. Probiotics may offer promise in mitigating these disruptions and associated side effects. This mini-review explores the impact of ALL treatment on the gut microbiota and the potential benefits of probiotics in pediatric oncology. Probiotics have shown promise in restoring gut microbial balance, reducing treatment-associated side effects, and potentially improving quality of life. However, potential adverse effects, particularly in immunocompromised patients, warrant caution. Notably, there's emerging interest in probiotics' role in bone health and mineral bioaccessibility. Further research is needed to elucidate probiotics' mechanisms and their broader impact on pediatric health. Integration of probiotics into ALL treatment and post-treatment regimens offers significant potential for improving patient outcomes and reducing treatment-related complications and long-lasting disruptions, although careful monitoring is essential.",0
"Relapsed/refractory acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R B-ALL) often responds poorly to induction chemotherapy. However, recent research has shown a novel and effective drug treatment for R/R B-ALL. A total of eight patients with R/R B-ALL were enrolled in the study from November 2021 to August 2022. All patients received chemotherapy based on a combination regimen of venetoclax and azacitidine. The regimen was as follows venetoclax 100 mg d Five of eight patients achieved very deep and complete remission (CR) with minimal residual disease (MRD) less than 0.1%. One patient achieved partial remission. Two patients did not achieve remission. There were no serious adverse events and all patients were well tolerated. Three patients were eligible for consolidation chemotherapy and were bridged to CAR-T therapy. The combined regimen of venetoclax and azacitidine may be beneficial for patients with R/R B-ALL.",0
"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the most specific marker of the myeloid lineage, essential for diagnosing acute myeloid leukemia and mixed phenotype acute leukemia with myeloid components. In this regard, we present a unique case of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with isolated MPO expression in bone marrow blasts detected by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, while peripheral blood blasts were negative for MPO expression. In this report, our discussion encompasses diagnostic pitfalls from a laboratory testing perspective in similar cases and includes a literature review. Furthermore, we emphasize the necessity of conducting a comprehensive analysis for the accurate diagnosis of MPO-positive B-ALL cases.",0
"The aim of the present work was to examine the effect of cross-linking of diferulic bridges, was also significantly higher in rye. Most (85-90%) of rye and wheat arabinoxylan by ferulic acid on grain nutritive value, of the alkaline-soluble ferulic acid in grain was localized in the insoluble measured in vitro by an enzymatic test. Determination of ferulic acid dietary fiber, and only about 5% was in the soluble fraction. In spite was based on spectrophotometric measurements of defatted samples at of the higher solubility of rye arabinoxylans and the higher arabinose320 nm. Approximately 80% of the trans-ferulic acid, the dominant xylose ratio in rye than in wheat grain, the ratio of the number of arabinose phenolic acid of rye and wheat grain, was found in the bran of both residues per ferulic acid molecule was not significantly higher in the soluble species. Total content and extractability of free and esterified ferulic fiber of rye. Thus, cross-linking of grain hemicellulose components by acid by water, ethanol, and alimentary enzymes (soluble dietary fiber) ferulic bridges does not appear to contribute to the known differences from grain meal were significantly higher in rye than in wheat.

"One way to naturally inhibit the oxidative deterioration of beer would involve protecting the antioxidants present in barley (mainly polyphenols) during the malting process. Depending on the variety, the antioxidant activity of barley is not negligible. Its relationship with the content of the three main phenolic groups (flavan-3-ols, hydroxycinnamic derivatives and flavonols), determined by a new ultraviolet spectrophotometric method, is proposed. It increases during malting probably not only by the modification or releasing of phenolic compounds, but also by the formation of new antioxidants, such as Maillard reaction products.",1
"Over the past several decades, survival of children with ALL has improved dramatically with treatment regimens refined through cooperative group trials. Despite aggressive treatment and iterative therapy changes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs), improvement has not been as promising. Comparisons between pediatric and adult clinical trials have consistently demonstrated superior outcomes for AYAs treated on pediatric ALL protocols, leading to the implementation of pediatric-inspired ALL protocols by several groups worldwide and/or expansion of the age limit of pediatric trials to include the full spectrum of the AYA population. Despite these efforts, AYAs in both pediatric and adult settings continue to have inferior survival compared with younger children with ALL. Real-world data suggest that uptake of pediatric-style treatment is variable, and even with identical pediatric-style treatment, AYAs still fare worse than younger children. As we enter an era of immunotherapy and precision medicine for newly diagnosed ALL, now is an opportune time to consider how best to approach future therapy for AYA patients. Comparisons of pediatric and adult treatment approaches and subanalyses of AYA patients will help guide harmonization of treatment. The focus of the next stage of ALL therapy for AYA should not only involve novel treatment approaches but also standardization and optimization of supportive care measures, psychosocial support, adherence interventions, oncofertility treatment, and survivorship care. All these efforts should simultaneously work to address health disparities to ensure that a future of improved outcomes is experienced equitably for all AYA patients.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a disease of lymphoid progenitor cells arising in the bone marrow and extramedullary sites. While it is the most common pediatric cancer, ALL is a rare disease overall, with approximately 6500 new cases diagnosed in the United States, in 2024. Current treatment relies on multiagent chemotherapy administered over 2-3 years, resulting in long-term survival in 80%-90% in pediatric patients compared to 40%-50% in adult patients, depending upon patient- and disease-specific characteristics. Historically considered a poor risk ALL subtype, the treatment and outcome of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive B-cell ALL were drastically changed with the advent of the BCR::ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The combination of a TKI with a backbone of multiagent chemotherapy, or more recently blinatumomab, is the mainstay of therapy, resulting in 5-year survival rates of 80+%. Achieving a complete molecular remission, particularly by next generation sequencing, is an important prognostic indicator, which may identify patients who may avoid allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The treatment approach for patients with Ph-negative B-cell ALL was historically composed of a chemotherapy backbone (either pediatric-inspired, or Hyper-CVAD based). Novel agents including inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab are being incorporated into these regimens to improve the rates of measurable residual disease negativity and long-term outcomes. While differences in long-term survival rates differ between age groups, such as adolescents and young adults compared to older adults (≥ 60 years), with these immunotherapy-chemotherapy regimens, the 4-year survival rates have improved to 80%-85% among patients who are able to receive these treatments. Elderly patients represent a difficult population to treat due to poor chemotherapy tolerance, high-risk disease features, and increased risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. The use of inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab in lieu of intensive chemotherapy in this population has improved safety and efficacy in patients ≥ 60 years old. Clinical trials incorporating chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy into treatment for older patients are in progress. Combination chemotherapy regimens incorporating pegylated asparaginase and nelarabine are the standard for patients with T-cell ALL. Early T-cell precursor (ETP) ALL is a high-risk subgroup for which allogeneic SCT should be considered. Inclusion of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax into treatment for patients with ETP-ALL may be beneficial and is currently being investigated. Several therapies are approved as single agents in the salvage setting. However, the best outcomes are obtained with combination therapy including chemo- and immuno- therapies followed by CAR T-cell consolidation and allogeneic SCT. Clinical trials optimizing this approach are ongoing.",0
"Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.",1
"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are heterogenous lipid membrane particles typically less than 200 nm in size and secreted by most cell types either constitutively or upon activation signals. sEVs isolated from biofluids contain RNAs, including small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), that can be either encapsulated within the EV lumen or bound to the EV surface. EV-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) are, despite a relatively low abundance, extensively investigated for their selective incorporation and their role in cell-cell communication. In contrast, the sorting of highly-structured ncRNA species is understudied, mainly due to technical limitations of traditional small RNA sequencing protocols. Here, we adapted ALL-tRNAseq to profile the relative abundance of highly structured and potentially methylated small ncRNA species, including transfer RNAs (tRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and Y RNAs in bulk EV preparations. We determined that full-length tRNAs, typically 75 to 90 nucleotides in length, were the dominant small ncRNA species (>60% of all reads in the 18-120 nucleotides size-range) in all cell culture-derived EVs, as well as in human plasma-derived EV samples, vastly outnumbering 21 nucleotides-long miRNAs. Nearly all EV-associated tRNAs were protected from external RNAse treatment, indicating a location within the EV lumen. Strikingly, the vast majority of luminal-sorted, full-length, nucleobase modification-containing EV-tRNA sequences, harbored a dysfunctional 3' CCA tail, 1 to 3 nucleotides truncated, rendering them incompetent for amino acid loading. In contrast, in non-EV associated extracellular particle fractions (NVEPs), tRNAs appeared almost exclusively fragmented or 'nicked' into tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) with lengths between 18 to 35 nucleotides. We propose that in mammalian cells, tRNAs that lack a functional 3' CCA tail are selectively sorted into EVs and shuttled out of the producing cell, offering a new perspective into the physiological role of secreted EVs and luminal cargo-selection.",0
"The phenolic profiles of 12 samples of Portuguese commercial and one home-made quince jelly were determined by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, in order to evaluate their authenticity. Two different extraction methods were needed for the complete definition of quince jelly profile, one of them including an Amberlite XAD-2 cleaning step. These analyses showed that all samples presented a similar profile composed of at least eight identified phenolic compounds. None of the samples were fraudulently adulterated by the addition of pear or apple, since they did not contain arbutin, the characteristic compound of pear, nor phloretin 2′-xylosylglucoside and phloretin 2′-glucoside, considered the chemical markers of apple. All samples exhibited 5-HMF, a sugar derivative, as the major compound.",1
"The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and health.",1
"Current classifications (World Health Organization-HAEM5/ICC) define up to 26 molecular B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) disease subtypes by genomic driver aberrations and corresponding gene expression signatures. Identification of driver aberrations by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) is well established, while systematic approaches for gene expression analysis are less advanced. Therefore, we developed ALLCatchR, a machine learning-based classifier using RNA-Seq gene expression data to allocate BCP-ALL samples to all 21 gene expression-defined molecular subtypes. Trained on n = 1869 transcriptome profiles with established subtype definitions (4 cohorts; 55% pediatric / 45% adult), ALLCatchR allowed subtype allocation in 3 independent hold-out cohorts (n = 1018; 75% pediatric / 25% adult) with 95.7% accuracy (averaged sensitivity across subtypes: 91.1% / specificity: 99.8%). High-confidence predictions were achieved in 83.7% of samples with 98.9% accuracy. Only 1.2% of samples remained unclassified. ALLCatchR outperformed existing tools and identified novel driver candidates in previously unassigned samples. Additional modules provided predictions of samples blast counts, patient's sex, and immunophenotype, allowing the imputation in cases where these information are missing. We established a novel RNA-Seq reference of human B-lymphopoiesis using 7 FACS-sorted progenitor stages from healthy bone marrow donors. Implementation in ALLCatchR enabled projection of BCP-ALL samples to this trajectory. This identified shared proximity patterns of BCP-ALL subtypes to normal lymphopoiesis stages, extending immunophenotypic classifications with a novel framework for developmental comparisons of BCP-ALL. ALLCatchR enables RNA-Seq routine application for BCP-ALL diagnostics with systematic gene expression analysis for accurate subtype allocation and novel insights into underlying developmental trajectories.",0
"Relapse remained the major obstacle to improving the prognosis of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study aimed to investigate the changing patterns of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements between diagnosis and relapse and the clinical relevance and to explore the mechanism of leukemic relapse. Clonal Ig/TCR gene rearrangements were screened by multiplex PCR amplification in 85 paired diagnostic and relapse bone marrow (BM) samples from children with ALL. The new rearrangements presented at relapse were quantitatively assessed by the RQ-PCR approach targeting the patient-specific junctional region sequence in 19 diagnostic samples. The relapse clones were further back-traced to diagnostic and follow-up BM samples from 12 patients. Comparison of Ig/TCR gene rearrangements between diagnosis and relapse showed that 40 (57.1%) B-ALL and 5 (33.3%) T-ALL patients exhibited a change from diagnosis to relapse, and 25 (35.7%) B-ALL patients acquired new rearrangements at relapse. The new relapse rearrangements were present in 15 of the 19 (78.9%) diagnostic samples as shown by RQ-PCR, with a median level of 5.26 × 10 Backtracking Ig/TCR gene rearrangements in relapse clones of pediatric ALL revealed complex patterns of clonal selection and evolution for leukemic relapse.",0
"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) remain significant challenges in haematological oncology. This review examines the pathophysiology, classification, and risk stratification of these aggressive malignancies, emphasising their impact on treatment strategies and prognosis. We discuss current standard-of-care treatments, including chemotherapy regimens and targeted therapies, while addressing the associated adverse effects and hypersensitivity reactions. Delving into the metabolic characteristics and vulnerabilities of leukaemia cells, the review highlights the key differences between lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia and how metabolic insights can be utilised for therapeutic purposes, with special focus on asparaginase therapy and its potential for improvement in both ALL and AML treatment. The review conveys the importance of personalised medicine approaches based on individual metabolic profiles and the challenges posed by metabolic heterogeneity and plasticity in leukaemia cells. Combining molecular and metabolic profiling can enhance and refine treatment strategies for acute leukaemia, potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life. However, integrating these into routine clinical practice requires overcoming various practical, technical, and logistical issues.",0
"Ferulic acid, a very attractive natural antioxidant is present in beer in free form, but the main form is the bound form as feruloylated oligosaccharides. Previous research showed that feruloylated oligosaccharides more effectively inhibited lipid and Low Density Lipoprotein oxidation than free ferulic acid. The aim of the present study was to evaluate free and bound ferulic acid concentrations throughout the brewing process in experimental mashes (worts, beers during fermentation, maturation and storage), and to conduct a comparison in commercial beers. Another aim of the study was to investigate methods to increase levels of bound ferulic acid in beer due to the potential health benefits. Specifically, the influence of commercial enzyme preparations on both forms of ferulic acid contents was studied. Five commercial enzyme preparations during mashing were examined: Celluclast, Shearzyme, Viscozyme, Cereflo and Ultraflo. In all experimental beers, the concentrations of esterified ferulic acid were 4–6 fold higher than the corresponding free ferulic acid contents, depending on the enzyme preparation used. Ferulic acid contents in the ester form in experimental beers were in the range of 748.4 mg/hL to 1244.3 mg/hL, whereas the contents of free ferulic acid were in the range of 134.6 mg/hL to 275.2 mg/hL. Comparison of free and bound ferulic acid contents in experimental beers, produced using enzyme preparations and commercial beers found in a local market, showed that concentrations of bound ferulic acid in experimental beers were significantly higher than in commercial beers, whereas concentrations of free ferulic acid in experimental and commercial beers were comparable.",1
"Aim: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of naringin and naringenin in rats after oral administration of Rhizoma Drynariae extract. Methods: The extract of Rhizoma Drynariae were refluxed with 50% ethanol for 1 h and dissolved with 50% PEG 400, and then administered to the rats. Naringin and naringenin were extracted from rat plasma by means of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with ethyl acetate. Paracetamol was used as the internal standard (IS). The analysis was carried out on an ACQUITY UPLC™ BEH C18 column with acetonitrile-0.4% acetic acid (80: 20, V/V) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.25 mL·min−1. The detection was carried out via negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM). The quantification was performed using the transitions of m/z 578.4→270.7 for naringin, m/z 270.7→150.7 for naringenin and m/z 149.9→106.6 for paracetamol (IS), respectively. Results: After oral administration of Rhizoma Drynariae extract to rats, the mean Cmax of naringin and naringenin was (2.56 ± 0.77) × 103 ng·mL−1 and 222 ± 45 ng·mL−1, the Tmax was 0.67 ± 0.20 h and 8.0 ± 1.3 h, the AUC 0-t was calculated to be (3.23 ± 0.54) × 103 ng·mL−1·h and (1.57 ± 0.37) × 103 ng·mL−1·h, the AUC 0-∞ was calculated to be (3.29 ± 0.54) × 103 ng·mL−1·h and (1.79 ± 0.43) × 103 ng·mL−1·h. The t½ was 4.1 ± 0.8 h for naringin, and another small peak could be seen at 8h in the plasma concentration–time profile of naringin. Conclusion: The developed UPLC-MS/MS method was conformed to the criteria for the analysis of biological samples according to the guidance of FDA. The results of pharmacokinetic study on naringin and its active metabolite naringenin would be a suitable reference in clinical application for Rhizoma Drynariae.",1
"On June 14, 2024, the FDA approved blinatumomab (BLINCYTO; Amgen, Inc.) in the consolidation phase of treatment for CD19-positive, Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP ALL). The FDA reviewed results from three randomized trials using blinatumomab in consolidation: Study E1910 (adult patients with newly diagnosed BCP ALL without minimal residual disease), Study 20120215 (pediatric patients with high-risk BCP ALL in first relapse), and Study AALL1331 (pediatric and young adult patients with BCP ALL in first relapse). Study E1910 demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) when comparing alternating blinatumomab and chemotherapy cycles versus chemotherapy cycles alone [HR = 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.24-0.75; P = 0.003]. In Study 20120215, the efficacy of blinatumomab as an alternative to a third cycle of chemotherapy was primarily supported by descriptive analyses of the secondary endpoint of OS (HR = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.7) and a post hoc analysis of relapse-free survival (HR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.22-0.66). AALL1331 did not meet its primary objectives for the randomizations in the high/intermediate-risk arm comparing blinatumomab versus chemotherapy or in the low-risk arm comparing blinatumomab cycles and chemotherapy cycles versus chemotherapy cycles alone. A meta-analysis of OS performed using the above studies and the infant study NL59901.078.17 was consistent with a treatment effect of blinatumomab during consolidation. The safety profile of blinatumomab cycles was consistent with previous studies. The benefit of blinatumomab during the consolidation phase of therapy is consistent across line of therapy (newly diagnosed vs. relapsed) and patient age (adult vs. pediatric).",0
"A simple and reproducible method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils by solid-phase extraction (SPE), high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), and HPLC-mass spectrometry (MS) in tandem mode was developed. The polar fraction was obtained from samples of three different virgin olive oils. Detection and quantification were performed at 280, 240, and 320 nm. For identification purposes, HPLC-MS/MS was equipped with turbo ion spray source in the negative-ion mode. Twenty compounds of twenty-three detected and quantified were characterized. The method showed satisfactory linearity (r > 0.99), good recovery, satisfactory precision, and appropriate limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ).",1
"Oat milling fractions were examined for concentrations of total phenolics, tocols, and phenolic acids and in vitro antioxidant activity to determine their potential as dietary antioxidants. Methanolic extracts of pearling fractions, flour and aspirations from flaking, and trichomes had high, intermediate, and low antioxidant activities, respectively, evaluated by the beta-carotene bleaching method. Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation. These data indicate a potential for oat products, especially those enriched in outer layers of the groat, to contribute to dietary intakes of antioxidant phytonutrients.",1
"To analyze the related factors of treatment failure in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in real-world. The clinical data of 1414 newly diagnosed children with ALL admitted to five hospital in Fujian province from April 2011 to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Treatment failure was defined as relapse, non-relapse death, and secondary tumor. Following-up for median time 49.7 (0.1-136.9) months, there were 269 cases (19.0%) treatment failure, including 140 cases (52.0%) relapse, and 129 cases (48.0%) non-relapse death. Cox univariate and multivariate analysis showed that white WBC≥50×10 The treatment failure of children with ALL in our province is still relatively high, with relapse being the main cause of treatment failure, while treatment related death and treatment abandonment caused by economic factors are the main causes of non-relapse related death. 儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病的治疗失败相关因素分析——福建省多中心真实世界数据分析. 分析真实世界中儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病（ALL）的治疗失败相关因素。. 回顾性分析2011年4月至2020年12月福建省5家医院收治的1 414例初诊ALL患儿的临床资料。治疗失败定义为复发、非复发相关死亡和第二肿瘤。. 中位随访时间为49.7（0.1-136.9）个月，共有269例（19.0%）治疗失败，其中140例（52.0%）为复发，129例（48.0%）为非复发死亡，0例第二肿瘤。Cox单因素及多因素分析结果显示，初诊白细胞计数≥50×10 福建省儿童ALL的治疗失败率仍较高，复发为治疗失败的最主要原因，而治疗相关死亡、经济因素放弃导致死亡则是无复发死亡的主要原因。.",0
"Medications used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), such as L-asparaginase, can cause blood lipid disturbances. These can also be associated with polymorphisms of the lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genes. We aimed to investigate the association between lipid profile, certain LpL and APOE gene polymorphisms (rs268, rs328, rs1801177 and rs7412, rs429358 respectively) as well as the risk subgroup in 30 pediatric patients being treated for ALL, compared with 30 pediatric ALL survivors and 30 healthy controls. The only APOE gene polymorphism with significant allelic and genotypic heterogeneity was rs429358. Further analysis of this polymorphism showed that genotype (CC, CT, or TT) was significantly associated with (1) changes in the lipid profile at the end of consolidation (total cholesterol, LDL, apo-B100, and lipoprotein a) and during re-induction (total cholesterol and apo-B100), and (2) classification in the high risk-ALL subgroup (for CC genotype/C allele presence). Lipid abnormalities in children being treated for ALL may be associated with the APOE genotype, which is also possibly associated with risk stratification. Further research is needed to confirm the potential prognostic value of these findings.",0
"The effect of fruit maturation on changes in carotenoids, flavonoids, total soluble reducing equivalents, phenolic acids, ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (AOX) in different pepper types (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, and Capsicum chinese) was determined. Generally, the concentration of these chemical constituents increased as the peppers reached maturity. Peppers contained high levels of L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids at maturity, contributing 124-338% of the RDA for vitamin C and 0.33-336 RE/100 g of provitamin A activity, respectively. Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.",1
"Minimal residual disease (MRD) has become an essential tool in the management of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and aids in tailoring treatment strategies to suit specific patient needs. Although much progress has been made in this area, there is limited data on the use of MRD in the Indian context. Our objective was to identify relevant literature that discusses the utility of MRD in the management of B-cell ALL in adolescents and young adults (AYA) and adults in Indian settings. A systematic search and screening of articles were performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The primary data source was PubMed followed by Google Scholar for articles and conference proceedings. Of the 254 records screened, 24 records were retained for analysis. MRD monitoring had a significant role in the management of AYA/adult B-cell ALL patients. Variability of results was observed across these studies with respect to methods, techniques, and use. However, these studies evidenced and validated the importance of MRD assessment in risk-adapted management of B-cell ALL and highlighted the need for optimization. The advances in MRD diagnostics and applications are yet to be tested and adopted in Indian settings. Hence, there is a need for in-depth research to develop and optimize approaches for calibrating country-specific management strategies. The potential role of MRD assessments in anticipating relapse or treatment failures warrants more attention for the preemptive positioning of novel strategies involving immunotherapies.",0
"Circular RNA (circRNA) is crucial in various biological processes, particularly in the onset and progression of different diseases. Nevertheless, the function of circMUC16 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains unclear. The expression of circMUC16, miR-1182 and TPPP3 was evaluated by qPCR. The role of circMUC16 in the progression of ALL was investigated bymcherry-EGFP-LC-3, cell cycle, flow cytometry apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, western blotting, and an in vivo xenograft model. The interactions among circMUC16, miR-1182, and TPPP3 were explored by using qPCR, western blot, dual-luciferase reporter, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays.In this study, it was found that circMUC16 was increased in ALL cells. Down-regulation of circMUC16 reduced autophagy, cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro while inhibiting cancer in vivo. circMUC16 acted as a molecular sponge of miR-1182. The carcinogenic effect of circMUC16 was partially mediated by miR-409-3p. TPPP3 was shown to be a direct target of miR-1182 and to be competed with circMUC16. Overexpression of TPPP3 partially counteracted the inhibitory effects of sh-circMUC16 inhibition on malignant behaviors of ALL cells. This study revealed that the circMUC16/miR-1186/TPPP3 axis plays a crucial role in the progression of ALL, suggesting a novel therapeutic target for ALL therapy.",0
"Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer with survival exceeding 90% for standard-risk groups. A debilitating side-effect of treatment is the development of overweight/obesity (OW/OB), which develops in approximately 40% of children by the end of treatment. The microbiome has been associated with the development of OW/OB. We examined fluctuations in the microbiome with the development of OW/OB during the first six months of treatment at diagnosis, and two subsequent timepoints (N = 62). Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on Illumina Nextseq system, and taxa and functional pathways were extracted from sequences using kraken2 and humann2, respectively. An association of increased presence of several species (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was observed in children with OW/OB, while lean-promoting species (Veillonella, Haemophilus, and Akkermansia) were increased in children who maintained a normal weight. Pathway analysis revealed purine nucleotide biosynthesis, sugar nucleotide biosynthesis, and enzyme cofactor biosynthesis were positively correlated with Bacteroides spp. among children with OW/OB. We identified several taxa and functional pathways that may confer increased risk for the development of OW/OB. The associations observed in this pilot are preliminary and warrant further research in the microbiome and the development of OW/OB in childhood ALL.",0
"Total Antioxidant Activities (TAA) of freshly squeezed and processed blood and blond orange juices were measured using the ABTS radical-cation method. Blood juices have TAA values higher than blond juices, and freshly-squeezed juices are higher than processed. Levels of ascorbic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid and anthocyanins were determined in order to calculate relative contributions to TAA by Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of such constituents. Ascorbic acid was the main contributor (∼70%), followed by hydroxycinnamic acids and anthocyanins. Calculated TAA accounted for 91% (mean) of that measured, reaching a maximum of 98% (mean) for the ‘not-from-concentrate’ blood juices (NFC). Reconstituted (from concentrate) blood juices (RFC) had higher TAA than NFC, and the difference could be ascribed to the increased amount of carotenoid pigments in the serum of RFC juices, as a consequence of the thermal concentration process. Despite the degradation of anthocyanins during storage, TAA of NFC and RFC juices remained unchanged up to 60 days at 2°C, whereas it decreased when RFC juice was stored at 20°C, in accordance with the observed decrease of ascorbic acid.",1
"The stability of the major flavonol glucosides, quercetin 3,4‘-O-diglucoside (QDG) and quercetin 4‘-O-monoglucoside (QMG), was studied in two varieties of onion (Red Baron and Crossbow) that were cured and stored for 6 months under normal commercial conditons and analyzed at regular intervals. Onions were also cooked by boiling in water and by frying in oil under normal domestic conditions. Apart from a 50% loss of quercetin 4‘-O-monoglucoside during the initial drying process, little change in content and composition was observed over 6 months of storage. Neither boiling nor frying resulted in interconversion of the quercetin conjugates or production of free quercetin, although a 25% loss overall was recorded for each process.",1
"The aim is to identify preventable cause for hospital readmissions during induction and implement interventions to decreased preventable treatment-associated complications. Multiple factors contribute to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) requiring readmissions during induction. A dashboard monitored features of newly diagnosed patients with ALL. Readmission causes were stratified as preventable, possibly preventable, or unpreventable. A discharge checklist, including standardized education, and change of discharge date were implemented. Initially, there were 57 hospital readmissions of 98 patients (9 intensive care unit admissions and 2 deaths). Sixteen preventable (28.1%) and 32 unpreventable (56.1%) readmissions. After the interventions were initiated, including improved education, discharge checklist utilization, and standardized discharge date, there were 23 readmissions (78.3% were unpreventable, 6 intensive care unit admissions). Intervention implementation reduced readmission rates of induction patients with ALL by 20%.",0
"This study aimed to compare the efficacy of anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) versus chemotherapy plus donor lymphocyte infusion (chemo-DLI) for treating relapsed CD19-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Clinical data of 43 patients with B-ALL who relapsed after allo-HSCT were retrospectively analyzed. Twenty-two patients were treated with CAR-T cells (CAR-T group), and 21 with chemotherapy plus DLI (chemo-DLI group). The complete remission (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR rates, leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate, overall survival (OS) rate, and incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were compared between the two groups. The CR and MRD-negative CR rates in the CAR-T group (77.3% and 61.5%) were significantly higher than those in the chemo-DLI group (38.1% and 23.8%) (P=0.008 and P=0.003). The 1- and 2-year LFS rates in the CAR-T group were superior to those in the chemo-DLI group: 54.5% and 50.0% vs. 9.5% and 4.8% (P=0.0001 and P=0.00004). The 1- and 2-year OS rates in the CAR-T versus chemo-DLI group were 59.1% and 54.5% vs. 19% and 9.5% (P=0.011 and P=0.003). Six patients (28.6%) with grade 2-4 aGVHD were identified in the chemo-DLI group. Two patients (9.1%) in the CAR-T group developed grade 1-2 aGVHD. Nineteen patients (86.4%) developed CRS in the CAR-T group, comprising grade 1-2 CRS in 13 patients (59.1%) and grade 3 CRS in 6 patients (27.3%). Two patients (9.1%) developed grade 1-2 ICANS. Donor-derived anti-CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy may be better, safer, and more effective than chemo-DLI for B-ALL patients who relapse after allo-HSCT.",0
"The effect of conventional and microwave pasteurization on the main flavonoids present in grapefruit juice and their stability throughout 2months of refrigerated and frozen storage was evaluated. Individual flavonoids were analyzed by HPLC. The results showed that naringin, narirutin, quercetin and naringenin were the most abundant flavonoids in grapefruit juice. In general, although every pasteurization treatment caused a significant reduction in the content of all the studied flavonoids, the treated samples were more stable during storage. While fresh squeezed juice (FS) and conventional pasteurized juice (CP) were better preserved under refrigeration conditions, microwave pasteurized juice (MP) conserved better when frozen stored. In fact, after 2months, frozen MP samples showed the greatest flavonoid retention. From this point of view, microwave treatment can be considered a good alternative to conventional pasteurization.",1
"Six strawberry cultivars grown on the same commercial plantation in Brazil were evaluated for their chemical composition and quality attributes at the ripe stage. The profiles of the main soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins were also obtained during the developmental stages. Results showed significant differences among cultivars in all of the investigated parameters. Cv. Campineiro showed an average value for texture of 0.63 N, half the value found for cv. Oso Grande. Anthocyanin content ranged from 13 (cv. Campineiro) to 55 (cv. Mazi) mg/100 g. Total ascorbic acid found for cv. Campineiro (85 mg/100 g) was twice the amount found in cv. Dover (40 mg/100 g). Fructose was the predominant soluble sugar in almost all cultivars. The proportion among the main soluble sugars (fructose, sucrose, and glucose) was similar for Oso Grande and Toyonoka cultivars. The flavonol content (quercetin plus kaempferol derivatives) ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mg/100 g, with a mean value of 6.1 mg/100 g, whereas free ellagic acid ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 and total phenolics varied from 159 to 289 (mean 221) mg/100 g.",1

"Vitisin A was prepared from malvidin 3-glucoside and pyruvic acid in model wine medium, isolated by countercurrent chromatography, and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The synthesized compound was used as a reference standard to quantify vitisin A in Chilean wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, including a vertical row of wines from the same vineyard over 16 years. Maximum vitisin A content was reached within the first year of storage. Importantly, up to half of the initial amount of vitisin A in young wines was still present in 15 year old wines. Although vitisin A was found to be much more stable as compared to other monomeric C-4 underivatized anthocyanins, it also slowly degrades after reaching its peak concentration. The ""color activity concept"" was applied to vitisin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, malvidin 3-(6' '-acetylglucoside), and polymeric pigments isolated by countercurrent chromatography in order to estimate their contribution toward the overall color expression of wines. It was found that vitisin A is only a minor contributor to the visually perceived color of aged red wines (color contribution approximately 5%). The major contributor is the polymeric fraction (color contribution approximately 70-90%).",1
"To develop a novel prognostic scoring system for severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated with anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy, aiming to optimize risk mitigation strategies and improve clinical management. This single-center retrospective cohort study included 125 B-ALL patients who received anti-CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy from January 2017 to October 2023. These cases were selected from a cohort of over 500 treated patients on the basis of the availability of comprehensive baseline data, documented CRS grading, and at least 3 months of follow-up. Data on patient demographics, treatment history, laboratory parameters, CAR-T-cell characteristics, safety, and efficacy endpoints were collected. CRS severity was graded according to the 2019 ASTCT consensus criteria. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with CRS severity, and a prognostic model was constructed. The overall incidence of CRS was 67.2%, with 13.6% having grade ≥ 3 (severe) CRS. Higher baseline and post-lymphodepletion minimal residual disease (MRD) levels and neutropenia on day 7 post-infusion were significantly associated with severe CRS. Inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, and IL-6) and coagulation dysfunction (APTT) on day 7 post-infusion were also predictive of CRS severity. The prognostic model incorporating these factors demonstrated robust discriminatory ability, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.875. This study developed a novel prognostic scoring system for severe CRS in Chinese B-ALL patients receiving anti-CD19 CAR-T-cell therapy. The model integrates clinical and laboratory parameters to facilitate early identification and management of severe CRS. Further validation in larger, prospective cohorts is warranted.",0
"Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA > DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.",1
"Immune milieus play an important role in various types of cancer. The present study focuses on the effect of Th1 cytokines on pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The reaction of ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) to the most important Th1 cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and IFN-γ (interferon gamma) is analyzed and correlated with the respective cytokine receptors and the intracellular signaling molecules. ALL cell lines and ALL PDX display a great heterogeneity in cell death after incubation with TNF-α and IFN-γ. Several samples show a dose-dependent and additive induction of cell death by both cytokines; others do not react at all or even display an increased viability. Apoptosis is the main type of cell death induced by Th1 cytokines in ALL cells. Over all leukemia cells analyzed, IFN-γ receptor (IFNGR) shows a higher expression than both TNF-receptors, resulting in higher phosphorylation of STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) compared to phosphorylation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells) in the TNF pathway. The activation of STAT1 correlates with the amount of cell death after stimulation with Th1 cytokines. TNF-α and IFN-γ lead to heterogeneous reactions in ALL cell lines and ALL PDX but are able to induce cell death by apoptosis in the majority of ALL blasts. The correlation of a high expression of IFNGR and following activation of STAT1 with cell death indicates an important role for IFN-γ signaling in this setting.",0
"The influence of polyphenol oxidase and ascorbate oxidase on radical-scavenging activity and contents of total phenol, chlorogenic acid, and ascorbic acid in vegetables during the cooking process were investigated. In the case of burdock and lettuce, which have a high activity of polyphenol oxidase, the radical-scavenging activity and the content of total phenol and chlorogenic acid decreased drastically within 1 min. In the case of broccoli, however, only a small decrease of radical-scavenging activity was observed, and total phenol and chlorogenic acid decreased almost not at all. The decrease of the activity in broccoli depended on the oxidation of ascorbic acid by ascorbate oxidase. None of these compounds decreased after the enzymes had been inactivated by heating.",1
"Polyphenolic profiles of cider apple cultivars were studied in order to differentiate fruits according to their maturity state (ripe or unripe). Thiolysis and direct solvent extracts of freeze-dried apple pulps and peels were analysed by HPLC-DAD. Univariate data treatment did not achieve the mentioned target; thus a multivariate approach was considered. For each apple tissue data set, several chemometric techniques were applied to the most discriminant variables. Cluster analysis allowed a preliminary study of the data structure. Then, supervised pattern recognition procedures, namely linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbours, soft independent modelling of class analogy, and multilayer feed-forward artificial neural networks (MLF-ANN), were used to develop decision rules to classify samples in the established categories. Excellent results were afforded by MLF-ANN applied to the concentrations of total procyanidins and (+)-catechin and the average degree of polymerisation of procyanidins in apple pulp, with success in the prediction ability of 97% and 99% for unripe and ripe categories, respectively.",1
"The antioxidant effectiveness of selected wines and pure (+)-catechin were determined using three different methods. The radical scavenging potential was investigated using α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, the reducing power was determined using ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and β-carotene bleaching (BCB) method. Six red and four white wines from different grape cultivars were analyzed. Unpaired test between FRAP, DPPH, and BCB analysis of red and white wines showed significant difference. Different reducing/antioxidant power of red and white wines was elucidated in view of their different phenolic composition. As expected, the red wines had much higher flavonoid, anthocyanin, and catechin content than white wines. There was no significant difference between nonflavonoids phenols. All analyzed wines demonstrate significant antioxidant capacity with FRAP test. The average FRAP of red wines was almost 10-fold higher than the average FRAP of white wines. The reducing ability of red wines can be directly correlated with its flavonoid and catechin concentration. The relative antioxidant efficiency of pure (+)-catechin in FRAP assay was same as for ascorbate and Trolox.",1
"Acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) is a rare, high-risk form of acute leukemia. It is characterized by the inability to assign a single lineage of differentiation to the leukemia and can manifest with more than one lineage-defining marker, called mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), or the complete absence of such markers, defined as acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL). Recent genetic, epigenetic and metabolic insights refine diagnostic frameworks, inform classification and risk-stratification, and expose potential targetable vulnerabilities. However, the rarity and heterogeneous manifestations of ALAL result in ongoing diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty. The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) and International Consensus Classification (ICC) manuscripts provide a pragmatic framework integrating immunophenotypic and genetic criteria for classification, with recognition of specific somatic genetic alterations that define disease biology. These include rearrangements involving BCR::ABL1, KMT2A, ZNF384, and BCL11B activation. Current evidence supports the use of ALL-type induction regimens (with the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for Philadelphia-positive MPAL) over AML or hybrid approaches. For AUL the optimal therapeutic approach is uncertain. Incorporation of targeted therapies in combination with intensive, and lower-intensity chemotherapy backbones based on the specific biological and genetic characteristics of ALAL is an appealing approach and is increasingly reported. The use of lineage-specific targeted approaches may result in therapeutic pressure and lineage switch in patients with acute leukaemia with multi-phenotypic potential. The role and optimal platform for minimal residual disease surveillance in ALAL to guide therapy, and inform transplantation is unclear, given the paucity of prospective controlled data.",0
"Despite the advances in cancer treatment achieved, for example, by the CD20 antibody rituximab, an urgent medical need remains to optimize the capacity of such antibodies to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) that determines therapeutic efficacy. The cytokine IL-15 stimulates proliferation, activation, and cytolytic capacity of NK cells, but broad clinical use is prevented by short half-life, poor accumulation at the tumor site, and severe toxicity due to unspecific immune activation. We here report modified immunocytokines consisting of Fc-optimized CD19 and CD20 antibodies fused to an IL-15 moiety comprising an L45E-E46K double mutation (MIC",0
"In the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), current protocols combine initial high-dose multiagent chemotherapy with prolonged oral therapy with 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and low-dose methotrexate (MTX) maintenance therapy. Decades of research on ALL treatment have resulted in survival rates of approximately 90%. However, dose-response relationships vary widely between patients and insight into the influencing factors, that would allow for improved personalized treatment management, is insufficient. We use a detailed data set with measurements of thioguanine nucleotides and MTX in red blood cells and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to develop pharmacokinetic models for 6MP and MTX, as well as a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model capable of predicting individual ANC levels and thus contributing to the development of personalized treatment strategies. Here, we show that integrating metabolite measurements in red blood cells into the full PKPD model improves results when less data is available, but that model predictions are comparable to those of a fixed pharmacokinetic model when data availability is not limited, providing further evidence of the quality of existing models. With this comprehensive model development leading to dynamics similar to simpler models, we validate the suitability of this model structure and provide a foundation for further exploration of maintenance therapy strategies through simulation and optimization.",0
"Survival post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is improving, with an increasing number of survivors. Subsequent neoplasms (SNs) following HCTs are of particular concern. Between January 2003 and December 2022, HCT recipients' records were retrospectively reviewed. At a median follow-up of 108 months (range, 0.13-215), 2659 patients received HCTs. Of those, 1131 (43%) were <18 years old. Allogeneic HCTs were conducted in 1476 (56%) patients. Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was utilized in 2157 (81%), and 583(22%) received TBI. At a median of 9 years following transplant, forty-three patients developed SNs (1.6%) with a median age at time of HCT of 27.6 years (range, 2.8-64.8). Of those: 32 were males (74%), 20 received full HLA-matched allogeneic HCTs (46.5%), two (4.6%) had unrelated cord blood HCT (UCB), and one (2.3%) received haplo-HCT, whereas autologous HCTs accounted for 46.6% (n=20). Underlying diseases were: ALL(13.9%), AML(11.6%), Hodgkin Lymphoma(13.9%), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma(13.9%), Multiple Myeloma(18.6%), Fanconi Anemia(6.9%), CML(6.9%),Neuroblastoma(2.3%), and thalassemia (2.3%).); cGVHD occurred in (74%), and CMV infection/reactivation in (60.5%). Stem cell source included peripheral blood in (81.4%), BM in (3.9%), and UCB in (4.7%). Conditioning regimens were MAC (81.4%) vs RIC (18.6%). TBI-based regimen was utilized in 14 patients (32.5%). Subsequent hematologic malignancies accounted for 32.5% of SNs. While subsequent solid neoplasms occurred in 65.2%, and PTLD occurred in 2.3%. The probability of 5-year overall survival after a SN was 58.2%. SNs adversely impact the overall survival and quality of life of HCT survivors. In our cohort, the rate of post-HCT SNs was lower than that in the literature; however, longer follow-up of our cohort is needed.",0
"B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) consists of dozens of subtypes defined by distinct gene expression profiles (GEP) and various genetic lesions. With the application of transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]), multiple novel subtypes have been identified, which lead to an advanced B-ALL classification and risk-stratification system. However, the complexity of analyzing RNA-seq data for B-ALL classification hinders the implementation of the new B-ALL taxonomy. Here, we introduce Molecular Diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (MD-ALL), an integrative platform featuring sensitive and accurate B-ALL classification based on GEP and sentinel genetic alterations from RNA-seq data. In this study, we systematically analyzed 2,955 B-ALL RNA-seq samples and generated a reference dataset representing all the reported B-ALL subtypes. Using multiple machine learning algorithms, we identified the feature genes and then established highly sensitive and accurate models for B-ALL classification using either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data. Importantly, this platform integrates multiple aspects of key genetic lesions acquired from RNA-seq data, which include sequence mutations, large-scale copy number variations, and gene rearrangements, to perform comprehensive and definitive B-ALL classification. Through validation in a hold-out cohort of 974 samples, our models demonstrated superior performance for B-ALL classification compared with alternative tools. Moreover, to ensure accessibility and user-friendly navigation even for users with limited or no programming background, we developed an interactive graphical user interface for this MD-ALL platform, using the R Shiny package. In summary, MD-ALL is a user-friendly B-ALL classification platform designed to enable integrative, accurate, and comprehensive B-ALL subtype classification. MD-ALL is available from https://github.com/gu-lab20/MD-ALL.",0
"Two methods based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) using traditional cartridges and microelution SPE plates (muSPE) as the sample pre-treatment, and an improved liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were developed and compared to determine the phenolic compounds in virgin oil olive from plasma samples. The phenolic compounds studied were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, homovanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, luteolin, apigenin, pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol. Good recoveries were obtained in both methods, and the LOQs and LODs were similar, in the range of low muM. The advantage of muSPE, in comparison with SPE cartridges, was the lack of the evaporation step to pre-concentrate the analytes. The muSPE-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method developed was then applied to determine the phenolic compounds and their metabolites, in glucuronide, sulphate and methylated forms, in human plasma after the ingestion of virgin olive oil.",1
"Tubers from five potato cultivars were selected on the basis of their low, intermediate or high rates of glycoalkaloid synthesis in response to stresses such as light or cold storage temperatures. The tubers were subjected to a standard degree of damage sufficient to cause bruising but not severe damage such as cracking or splitting. Increases in glycoalkaloid levels in response to damage were observed in all cultivars. Importantly, the rates of glycoalkaloid synthesis in response to damage were in good agreement with cultivar response to light and cold temperature stress. The cultivars, Ailsa and Eden, exhibited a slower response than the higher synthesis rates observed in Pentland Dell or Brodick. The cultivar Torridon exhibited severe internal damage symptoms throughout the tuber as opposed to localised bruising observed in the other cultivars. The extensive cell death observed in the tubers of the cultivar Torridon severely curtailed glycoalkaloid and chlorogenic acid synthesis. The increased levels of glycoalkaloids in response to bruising damage ranged from approximately 27% (Ailsa, Torridon) to 130% for the cultivar Brodick. Chlorogenic acid levels increased in two cultivars (Brodick and Torridon) but not in the others, Ailsa, Eden and Pentland Dell. The α-chaconine/α-solanine ratios observed within the five cultivars were in good agreement with previous research. The consistency across years is notable, indicating a strong relationship in the synthesis of the two glycoalkaloids. The results are discussed in terms of implications for the potato industry, for the retail trade and also for selection within potato breeding programmes.",1
"Citrus fruits of different species and cultivars, (“Red blush” grapefruit, “Palazzelli” mandarin-type fruit, “Minneola” tangelo and “Salustiana” and “Shamouti” orange) were minimally processed as segments or juices and cold-stored for up to 12 or 15 days, respectively. The flavanone glycosides, ascorbic acid (AA) content and antioxidant capacity were determined during storage. Minimal processing had almost no effect on the main chemical constituents, but ascorbic acid decreased significantly in “Minneola” and “Salustiana” segments, with values ranging from 1.63 to 5.10 mg per gram of dry matter, although only in the last samples taken. One of the three juices (Salustiana) also showed a decrease in AA content. The segments and juices showed different behaviour during storage with regard to the flavonoid content, which ranged from 0.77 mg to 8.32 mg/g dry matter in Palazzelli mandarin and Red blush grapefruit, respectively. A significant increase in total flavonoids (mainly hesperidin) was found in the segments, while the juices showed a diminution in flavonoid content . Antioxidant capacity increased significantly in “Red blush” grapefruit juices and “Salustiana” orange segments, decreased in “Salustiana” juices and “Minneola” tangelo segments and remained constant in the other samples. The antioxidant capacity, moreover, was clearly correlated (r=0.968 and r=0.889 in segments and juices, respectively) with the ascorbic acid content rather than with the presence of flavanone glycosides.",1
"Activating point mutations of the RAS gene act as driver mutations for a subset of precursor-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (pre-B ALL) and represent an ambitious target for therapeutic approaches. The X box-binding protein 1 (XBP1), a key regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), is critical for pre-B ALL cell survival, and high expression of XBP1 confers poor prognosis in ALL patients. However, the mechanism of XBP1 activation has not yet been elucidated in RAS mutated pre-B ALL. Here, we demonstrate that XBP1 acts as a downstream linchpin of the IL-7 receptor signalling pathway and that pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of XBP1 selectively abrogates IL-7 receptor signalling via inhibition of its downstream effectors, JAK1 and STAT5. We show that XBP1 supports malignant cell growth of pre-B NRAS",0
"To investigate whether tibial-sided anterolateral ligament (ALL) injuries are associated with poor healing and residual pivot shift. Patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions within postinjury 6 weeks from January 2008 to March 2021 were included. They had concomitant ALL injury confirmed by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were followed for a minimum of 20 months. Preoperative ALL injury was graded by the Muramatsu classification, and postoperative ALL healing were graded by a modification of the Lee classification (good, partial, and nonvisualized). The patients were allocated to an improved group (IG) and an unimproved group (UG) on the basis of a comparison of pre- and postoperative MRI. ALL tear site, postoperative knee stability, Lysholm score, and Tegner activity scale (patient-reported outcomes [PROs]) were compared between the 2 groups. In total, 128 patients were enrolled; 94.5% patients achieved the minimal clinically important difference for PROs, respectively. The ALL was torn at the femoral side in 46.9% patients, at midsubstance in 31.2.%, and at tibial side in 21.9%, Preoperatively, 86 (67.2%) patients had a partial tear, and 42 (32.8%) patients had a complete tear. On the basis of the postoperative MRI appearances, 38 (29.7%) and 90 (70.3%) patients were allocated to the IG and UG, respectively. The tibial-side tears were significantly frequent in the UG (P = .032). Pivot shift showed a significantly greater incidence in the UG than IG (P = .004). Lachman test and PROs did not differ between the 2 groups. Tibial-sided ALL tears occurred in 18.7% of the UG compared with 3.2% of the IG, and 45.6% of the UG had a postoperative grade 1 or 2 pivot shift compared with 15.8% of the IG. Percentages of patients with the minimal clinically important difference for PROs did not differ between the 2 groups. However, the clinical relevance is limited by a high transfer bias. Level III, retrospective cohort study.",0
"Plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption by humans of 200 g of strawberries, containing 222 micromol of pelargonidin-3- O-glucoside, with and without cream. The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit time.",1
"The antioxidant effects of hydrophilic phenols and tocopherols on the oxidative stability in virgin olive oils and in purified olive oil have been evaluated. Total hydrophilic phenols and the oleosidic forms of 3,4-dihydroxyphenolethanol (3,4-DHPEA) were correlated (r=0.97) with the oxidative stability of virgin olive oil. On the contrary, tocopherols showed low correlation (r=0.05). Purified olive oil with the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to 3,4-DHPEA, an isomer of oleuropeine aglycon, and 3,4-DHPEA had good oxidative stability. A synergistic effect was observed in the mixture of 3,4-DHPEA and its oleosidic forms with α-tocopherol in purified olive oil by the Rancimat method at 120°C.",1

"B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) is a malignant proliferative B-lymphocyte disease. Although the outcome of B-ALL has greatly improved with combined chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, some patients still experience drug resistance, relapse and a low long-term survival rate, therefore, finding novel approaches to improve the outcome of adult B-ALL patients is critical. Our previous studies revealed that the selective histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) chidamide can inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by inhibiting MYCN and increasing the expression of DKK3 in B-ALL cells. Some studies have indicated that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can dysregulate the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2) protein family, we speculate that chidamide and BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax synergistically inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by inhibiting MYCN expression and increasing DKK3 expression. In our study, the in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed that chidamide and venetoclax synergistically inhibited the expression of MYCN and increased the expression of DKK3 by inhibiting the activity of HDAC and BCL2, inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and B-ALL cell proliferation. These findings indicate that the HDACi chidamide and the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax can be used in combination to treat B-ALL, providing a new method and strategy for treating B-ALL.",0
"Asparaginase (ASNase)-based chemotherapy regimens significantly improve survival outcomes in children, adolescent and young adult (AYA), and even adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (ALL); however, the incidence and severity of ASNase-associated adverse events (AEs) in adults may differ significantly from those reported in children. Strategies to mitigate, monitor for, and manage toxicities that allow adult ALL patients to receive full ASNase courses are needed. A representative 12-member panel of experts who treat AYA and adult ALL patients, incorporate ASNase into their treatment regimens, and conduct related research was assembled to consider opportunities to optimize the use of pediatric-inspired ALL regimens in these adult patients. Following 2 systematic biomedical literature searches from April 2009 through April 2024, a modified Delphi method was used to distill expert opinion into clinical statements that met a standardized definition of consensus. After 2 iterative Delphi method surveys, 23 statements met the standardized definition of consensus, whereas 19 statements did not. Five statements were merged to avoid redundancy. The clinical statements were grouped into 5 distinct categories: 1) hepatotoxicity; 2) hypersensitivity reactions; 3) thromboembolic and coagulopathy complications; 4) pancreatitis and metabolic complications; and 5) dosing. The intent of these statements is to provide health care providers with information that will help them mitigate, monitor for, and manage the most common and/or unique ASNase-induced AEs in adult ALL patients, allowing these patients to receive more or all the planned ASNase doses and thereby improve outcomes.",0
"Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare clinical entity. The concurrent development of MBC and leukemia is particularly rare. A 51-year-old male patient developed MBC following a 14-year complete remission of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy, and is currently receiving endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (10 mg twice daily, orally), with favorable outcomes observed during recent follow-up evaluations. MBC is predominantly diagnosed as locally advanced disease. Reported cases include MBC following acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and therapy-related AML post-chemotherapy for female breast cancer, whereas our case exhibits novel distinctions compared to prior reports. This case report describes the first documented occurrence of MBC in a patient who achieved complete remission from AML, offering valuable insights for the clinical management of analogous cases in the future.",0
"FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1), a transmembrane protein, is frequently mutated in various cancer types and has been described as context-dependent tumor suppressor or oncogene. The FAT1 gene is mutated in 12-16% of T-cell acute leukemia (T-ALL) and aberrantly expressed in about 54% of T-ALL cases contrasted with absent expression in normal T-cells. Here, we characterized FAT1 expression and profiled the methylation status from T-ALL patients. In our T-ALL cohort, 53% of patient samples were FAT1 positive (FAT1pos) compared to only 16% FAT1 positivity in early T-ALL patient samples. Aberrant expression of FAT1 was strongly associated with FAT1 promotor hypomethylation, yet a subset, mainly consisting of TLX1-driven T-ALL patient samples showed methylation-independent high FAT1 expression. Genes correlating with FAT1 expression revealed enrichment in WNT signaling genes representing the most enriched single pathway. FAT1 knockdown or knockout led to impaired proliferation and downregulation of WNT pathway target genes (CCND1, MYC, LEF1), while FAT1 overexpressing conveyed a proliferative advantage. To conclude, we characterized a subtype pattern of FAT1 gene expression in adult T-ALL patients correlating with promotor methylation status. FAT1 dependent proliferation and WNT signaling discloses an impact on deeper understanding of T-ALL leukemogenesis as a fundament for prospective therapeutic strategies.",0
"Nutritional and health-related compounds of alfalfa, wheat and soybean seeds dried by new drying process called the DIC process (controlled instantaneous pressure release) were evaluated, before and after sprouting. Vitamins (A, B1, B2, B6, C and E), minerals (Fe, Mg, Ca, K, Mn, Na, Cu and Zn) and phytoestrogens (genistein and daidzein ) content were determined. Alfalfa, soybean and wheat seeds dried by DIC showed similar content of biological compounds to seeds dried by traditional processes. Sprouting DIC-seeds significantly increased the levels of vitamins, minerals and phytoestrogens, improving their nutrititional value and health quality compared to fresh products. The increase of 1250-fold and 10-fold of the initial vitamin A and vitamin C content, respectively, of alfalfa seeds due to sprouting is remarkable. Sprouts from DIC-seeds showed a significantly higher vitamin A content than sprouts obtained from seeds dried by other methods. Soybean sprouts obtained from DIC-seeds showed a significant increase in free phytoestrogens, quantified as genistein (70.34±5.8 mg kg–1 d.w.) and daidzein (109.17.3±17.3 mg kg–1 d.w.).",1
"It is important to study the clinical profile of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and assess various prognostic factors implicated in response to induction chemotherapy for optimal treatment outcomes in India. The present study was done to evaluate the clinical profile and to find the correlation of day 7 and day 28 marrow blast response with already established prognostic factors in children with ALL in the region of North India using MCP 841 protocol for all patients. A total of 60 children up to ages 14 years with ALL were given treatment in the form of induction remission (MCP-841 protocol) I1 cycle (induction 1) therapy for 29 days. Complete hemogram for blast cells and bone marrow examination (bone marrow aspiration and, if required, bone marrow biopsy) was done on days 7 and 28 (completion of I1 cycle) to see early bone marrow response. Early response to induction therapy was compared in patients with and without high-risk factors, and results were analyzed statistically. Out of 60 enrolled children, 56 (93.4%) patients were in complete remission at the end of induction 1 cycle. Various risk factors were found to be of prognostic significance in first remission and early response to induction therapy were initial total leukocyte count (TLC) at presentation, immunophenotype of ALL; while other factors including age and sex was not found to be significant. Prevalence and significance of various prognostic factors implicated in pediatric ALL tend to be different in various populations. A better understanding of such factors in these populations will help in the tailoring of risk-adapted treatment protocols to local needs.",0
"The number of argyrophilic nucleolus organizer regions (AgNOR) is related to the proliferative activity of cells and the degree of neoplastic transformation. The surface area of AgNOR depending on nuclear structure may be a predictor of tumor recurrence, while research into acute leukemias is scarce. The aim of the study was to determine whether the assessment of AgNOR parameters is useful in the differentiation of acute leukemias and, together with cytogenetic changes, would allow for a quick evaluation of the risk group. The AgNOR structures were analyzed in terms of the shape, surface area and distribution in bone marrow blast cells in patients with acute leukemias. We observed significant differences in the AgNOR structures, simple, compound and complex patterns between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Complex structures were more numerous in ALL than in AML patients. There were significant differences in the distribution of AgNOR configuration among various cytogenetic AML risk groups. We observed a significant difference in the mean number of AgNOR between ALL-T and ALL-B. We detected diversity in the AgNOR structures and pattern map in AML and ALL. Thus, presentation of a variety of AgNOR configurations is innovative and can be a useful method of differentiating patients with acute leukemia types and cytogenetic risk.",0

"Aberrations in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus are associated with poor prognosis in pediatric precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) patients. The primary objective of this pilot study is to enhance our understanding of the IgH phenotype by exploring the intracellular chiral metabolome. Leukemia cells were isolated from the bone marrow of BCP-ALL pediatric patients at diagnosis. The samples' metabolome and transcriptome were characterized using untargeted chiral metabolomic and next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analyses. For the first time D- amino acids were identified in the leukemic cells' intracellular metabolome from the bone marrow niche. Chiral metabolic signatures at diagnosis was indicative of a resistant phenotype. Through integrated network analysis and Pearson correlation, confirmation was obtained regarding the association of the IgH phenotype with several genes linked to poor prognosis. The findings of this study have contributed to the understanding that the chiral metabolome plays a role in the poor prognosis observed in an exceptionally rare patient cohort. The findings include elevated D-amino acid incorporation in the IgH group, the emergence of several unknown, potentially enantiomeric, metabolites, and insights into metabolic pathways that all warrant further exploration.",0
"Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.",1
"Milling of wheat generates by-products, which can be used to improve the technological performance and/or to integrate foods with healthy compounds. The aim of this paper was to select fractions of durum wheat bran having different functional and nutritional characteristics. Wheat bran by-products were obtained by an industrial milling process. Beside the single fractions, two commercial products Bran & Brain 50 and 70, obtained by blending some of the durum wheat fractions were also studied. All samples were investigated for water holding capacity, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre content and for their antioxidant activity. The soluble fibre content of the durum wheat by-product ranged between 0.9% and 4.1%; while that of insoluble fibre between 21% and 64%. B&B 70 has a TDF content of 61%, while B&B 50 has 42%. The water holding capacity of each fraction is strictly related to the amount of insoluble fibre and to the granulometry of the by-products. Cooking-extrusion process does not affect the amount of soluble fibre; by contrast, a significant increase of the insoluble fibre was detected. The antioxidant activity is higher for the internal bran fraction and it increases in fractions having reduced granulometry. The antioxidant activity of some durum wheat by-product fractions is comparable to that of widespread fruits and fresh vegetables, likely due to the presence of fibre-bound phenol compounds. The high fibre content and antioxidant activity of durum wheat bran by-products can be of particular interest for their use in cereal-based products.",1
"Three native sun-dried date varieties from Oman (namely Mabseeli, Um-sellah, and Shahal), as well as their syrups and by-products (press cake and seed) were examined for their proximate composition, dietary fibre, total phenolics, and total antioxidant activity. Carbohydrate was the predominant component in all date varieties, syrups, and their by-products, followed by moisture, along with small amounts of protein, fat, and ash. Press cakes had the highest protein content, ranging in concentration from 3.62 g/100 g in Shahal to 5.23 g/100 g in Mabseeli, whereas fat was the highest in seeds and ranged from 5.02 g/100 g in Mabseeli to 5.90 g/100 g in Um-sellah. Seeds and press cakes were found to be good sources of dietary fibre, varied between 77.75 and 80.15 g/100 g fresh weight and between 25.39 and 33.81 g/100 g fresh weight, respectively. Among dates, syrups, and their by-products, seeds had the highest contents of total phenolics (3102–4430 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh weight) and antioxidant activity (580–929 μmol of Trolox equivalents/g fresh weight). The results obtained suggest that date by-products (particularly seeds) serve as a good source of natural antioxidants and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food ingredient.",1
"T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have historically been considered a spectrum of the same disease. However, recent evidence demonstrating differential responses to chemotherapy raise the possibility that T-LLy and T-ALL are distinct clinical and biologic entities. Here, we examine differences between the 2 diseases and use illustrative cases to highlight key recommendations on how to best treat patients with newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory T-LLy. We discuss results of recent clinical trials incorporating use of nelarabine and bortezomib, choice of induction steroid, role of cranial radiotherapy, and risk stratification markers to identify patients at highest risk of relapse and to further refine current treatment strategies. Because prognosis for relapsed or refractory T-LLy patients is poor, we discuss ongoing investigations incorporating novel therapies, including immunotherapeutics, into upfront and salvage regimens and the role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",0
"Research was initiated to measure antioxidant activity of extracts from oat (Avena sativa L.) groats and hulls and the concentrations of phenolic substances that may contribute to antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts of four cultivars was evaluated by an in vitro assay that measures the inhibition of coupled autoxidation of linoleic acid and β-carotene. Total phenolic content was determined using Folin and Ciocalteau's phenol reagent and was expressed as gallic acid equivalents. Phenolic compounds were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected at 290 nm. Peaks were identified by comparing retention times and spectra with known standards and verified with internal standards. Groats had significantly higher antioxidant activity than hulls. For two cultivars, total phenolic content was similar in groats and hulls, whereas one cultivar had higher and another lower total phenolic content in groats than hulls. Ten phenolic compounds were separated and identified in extracts, and one flavan-3-ol and three avenanthramides were tentatively identified. The concentrations of many of these compounds differed among cultivars and between fractions. In general, caffeic acid and the avenanthramides were predominantly found in groats, whereas many of the other phenolics were present in greater concentrations in hulls.",1
"The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds enhanced.",1
"Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an economically important berry crop that contains numerous phenolic compounds with potential health benefits. It is known that the content of phenolics is affected by processing factors, but limited information is available on the influence of cultural factors or genotype. To clarify this issue, phenolic compounds were analysed from a diverse range of raspberry cultivars grown under northern European conditions, in Finland. The content of phenolic compounds varied widely and significantly between cultivars. The quercetin content ranged from 0.32 (yellow cultivar) to 1.55 mg/100 g fresh weight (fw) (cv. Balder). The ellagic acid content varied from 38 (cv. Gatineau and cv. Nova) to 118 mg/100 g fw (cv. Ville). The total anthocyanin content varied from close to 0 (yellow cultivars) to 51 mg/100 g fw (cv. Gatineau). The content of total phenolics varied from 192 (cv. Gatineau) to 359 mg/100 g fw (cv. Ville). In addition, environment had a significant effect on the content of quercetin. Thus, breeding material should be evaluated for their potential health benefits over several regions in northern raspberry breeding.",1
"Furocoumarins represent a family of natural food constituents with phototoxic and photomutagenic properties. They are found mainly in plants belonging to the Rutaceae and Umbilliferae such as celery, carrots, and parsnips. Parsnips (Pastinaca sativa L.) have become more and more popular as a vegetable, e.g., as a constituent of or ingredient in baby food. Previous work has shown that microbial infection of parsnip roots can result in a dramatic increase in furocoumarin levels. In this study, freshly harvested parsnips were stored as whole roots, pieces (cubes), or homogenate at +4 degrees C or -18 degrees C over various time periods under standard conditions. It was found that furocoumarin concentrations (sum of five furocoumarins: angelicin, isopimpinellin, 5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and psoralen) in freshly harvested parsnips, analyzed by HPLC after extraction with diethyl ether and sequential solid phase (reversed-phase and silica) extraction, was generally lower than 2.5 mg/kg, and storage of parsnips in any form investigated at -18 degrees C over up to 50 days did not lead to a marked increase in furocoumarin levels. In contrast, storage of whole parsnips, but not of cubes or homogenate, at +4 degrees C resulted in a marked biphasic increase of furocoumarin concentrations after 7 and 38 days of storage up to levels of about 40 mg/kg. A dramatic increase in furocoumarin concentrations up to 566 mg/kg was observed when whole parsnips obtained from the market were kept at room temperature over 53 days, resulting in a visible microbial (mold) infection. Baby food products from the German market containing parsnips as an ingredient or constituent showed furocoumarin levels < or =0.41 mg/kg, suggesting that properly stored roots/preparations have been used. It is recommended that, after harvesting, parsnips be kept at -18 degrees C or under other conditions that prevent microbial infections.",1
"Patients with hematological malignancies often develop febrile neutropenia (FN) as a complication of cancer chemotherapy. Opportunistic infection, especially invasive fungal infection (IFI) is frequently encountered during the neutropenic phase. With this perspective different anti-fungal agents had been tried as prophylaxis in leukemia. Evaluation of the role of fluconazole was as antifungal prophylaxis in children with acute leukemia during induction chemotherapy. This randomized double-blind placebo controlled prospective study was carried out in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Bangladesh Medical University (BMU), Bangladesh from September 2016 to August 2017. Total 60 (30 were in fluconazole and 30 were in placebo group) patients of age range from 1 to 18 years were included in this study. Mean age of the patients were 7.08±3.33 years in fluconazole group 6.29±2.79 years in placebo group. Male: Female ratio was 1.14:1. Out of total 60 patients 44 were ALL and 16 AML. Mean duration of neutropenia in fluconazole and placebo group were 13.40±5.75 days and placebo 16.83±5.77 days respectively. Success rate of fluconazole prophylaxis was 25(83.3%). Failure rates of placebo were 40.0%. Duration of empirical antifungal therapy in fluconazole and placebo group differed significantly (p=0.008). Difference of neutrophil recovery achievement in two groups was also significant (p=0.015). The mean duration from AFP to EAF therapy is 17.60±1.51 days and 14.33±5.72 days in patient with fluconazole and placebo group respectively. Prophylactic fluconazole can be used to decrease the fungal infection as well as the duration of febrile neutropenia during induction chemotherapy of Acute Leukemia in children.",0
"This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods (catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.",1
"In this study the qualitative and quantitative content of the biophenolics in virgin olive oils is evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The extraction and purification method for these compounds from virgin oils was optimised. After liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction the separation of 35 of these compounds was achieved on reversed phase in gradient mode. The detection was preliminarily by UV and fluorescence, but then the final choice was ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode in negative ionization, acquiring two diagnostic product ions from the chosen precursor [M—H]–. Using this last approach we obtained the best sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity. The recovery of the method ranged from 70–90% and detection limits were less than 1 ng for all the analyzed compounds.",1
"Some of the medicinal properties of lemons are due to the flavonoids they contain since they are involved in many biological activities and have many health-related functions. The levels of the principal flavanones and flavone found in different cultivars of Citrus limon, are analysed in an attempt to identify the most interesting as regards the content of such secondary compounds. The results show that the immature fruits from cultivars Lisbon and Fino-49 are ideal for obtaining the flavanone hesperidin, while the mature fruits of cultivar Fino-49 and the leaves of cultivar Eureka are the most interesting for obtaining the flavone diosmin and the flavanone eriocitrin.",1
"Anthocyanin and flavonol glycosides of various blackberry, blueberry and red wine grape genotypes were identified and measured by a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separation method with photodiode array (PDA) and mass spectrometric (MS) detection. With this method, two distinct elution regions of anthocyanins and flavonols were obtained with near baseline separation of most compounds. Blackberry, blueberry and red wine grape genotypes varied markedly in total anthocyanins and total flavonols as well as oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The respective ranges of total anthocyanin (TA) and total flavonol (TF) contents of tested samples were: blackberries, 1143.9–2415.4 and 102.0–160.2 mg kg−1; blueberries, 1435.2–8227.3 and 172.5–327.5 mg kg−1; and red wine grapes, 380.9–7904.7 and 21.0–322.2 mg kg−1. Antioxidant activities and contents of total anthocyanins and total flavonols in blackberries, blueberries and red wine grapes were highly correlated, with linear relationships between ORAC and TA (rxy = 0.94) and TF (rxy = 0.90) for grapes, TA (rxy = 0.95) for blueberries and TA (rxy = 0.74) for blackberries.

"Acute leukemias are rare disease in the neonatal period. They occur preferentially in newborns with trisomy 21. They often manifest as hepatosplenomegaly, extra-hematopoietic involvement and hyperleukocytosis. Blueberry Muffin Baby syndrome is observed in the neonatal period. Neonatal acute myeloïd leukemia (AML) is more common than acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). Despite treatment, neonatal acute leukemias have a poor prognosis with a low percentage of overall survival. We report a case of neonatal AML on a ground of trisomy 21 revealed by a Blueberry Muffin Baby syndrome.",0
"In order to study catechin compositions in five Japanese persimmons: Hiratanenashi (HN), Tone-wase (TW), Ishibashi-wase (IW), Maekawa-jiro (MJ) and Matsumoto-wase-fuyu (MF), the contents of epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) were determined. Total phenolic contents were also determined for the studies of the catechin composition. Identification and quantification of the catechins were performed by HPLC. The EGC contents in three astringent persimmons (HN, TW and IW) were higher than those of two non-astringent persimmons (MJ and MF). The EGC content in HN (astringent) was the highest among the five Japanese persimmons. The EGC content in MF (non-astringent) was the lowest among the five Japanese persimmons. Therefore, astringent persimmons may be better sources of the natural antioxidant, EGC, than non-astringent persimmons, and HN (astringent) may be the best source of EGC among the five Japanese persimmons. This is the first comparative study of catechin compositions in five Japanese persimmons.",1
"The transfer of phenolic compounds of Olea europaea L. cv. Arbequina variety during olive oil extraction in relation to ripening stage was investigated. The parameters of oil extraction by the Abencor system are shown together with mass balances of the products and by products from the olive oil extraction in relation to olive paste. The phenolic compounds in olive paste, pomace, oil and wastewater were identified and measured by HPLC. Throughout the study, the concentrations of simple phenols, secoiridoids and flavonoids were higher in the olive paste and pomace phases than in oil and wastewater phases. High concentrations of 4-(acetoxyethyl)-1,2-dihydroxybenzene (3,4-DHPEA-AC) and secoiridoid derivatives such as the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to 3,4-DHPEA (hydroxytyrosol) or p-HPEA (tyrosol) (3,4-DHPEA–EDA, p-HPEA–EDA, where EDA is elenolic acid dialdehyde) and an isomer of oleuropein aglycone (3,4-DHPEA–EA, where EA is elenolic acid aldehyde) were found in olive oil, together with lignan compounds. It was observed that 3,4-DHPEA–EDA was the most abundant polyphenol present in the wastewater phase. This indicates that biotransformation occurred during olive extraction, especially in the crushing and malaxation operations, and reflects the possible chemical changes that lead to the formation of new compounds. Moreover, the distribution of compounds showed their affinities toward different phases.",1
"Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), In combination with other pro-angiogenic factors, plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis and the pathogenesis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of VEGF-A and its prognostic relevance in the outcome of patients with ALL. A comprehensive literature search was conducted up to January 2025 across multiple databases. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using a random-effects model to quantify effect sizes. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were employed to explore heterogeneity sources. Data extracted from 15 studies encompassing 674 patients with ALL demonstrated a significant correlation between elevated VEGF-A levels and unfavorable prognosis (SMD: 0.878; 95% CI: 0.276-1.479; p = 0.004). Notably, increased VEGF-A levels were particularly evident in pediatric patients older than 8 years (SMD: 0.758; 95% CI: 0.178-1.338; p = 0.010). The results indicate that heightened VEGF-A expression is associated with poorer clinical outcomes in ALL, supporting its utility as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in this patient population.",0
"Quantitative determinations were made of p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, sinapic, p-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, and syringic acids which occur as alkali- and acid-hydrolyzable derivatives in ethanolic extracts of wheat tissues. The ethanol-insoluble (cell wall) residues also yielded phenolic acids on cold alkaline hydrolysis. Comparatively large quantities of p-coumaric and ferulic acids (1.8 mg/g dry wt, and 4 mg/g dry wt., respectively, in 25-day-old shoots) were obtained from this fraction, the amounts depending on the age of the tissue. Phenolic acids in the ethanol-soluble fraction reached a maximum concentration about 9 days after germination. The amounts fell off with increasing age, reaching a minimum 4 to 5 weeks later. There was no obvious relationship between the amounts of these acids as reported here and rates of lignification as reported for the wheat plant by others. The behavior of sinapic acid was markedly different from that of p-coumaric and ferulic acids and it is suggested that it may not be a natural precursor of the syringyl units of lignin.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, known to present with ocular manifestations in rare cases. We describe the case of a 9-year-old previously healthy male who developed a 2-day history of periocular swelling and was found on MRI to have a large sphenoidal mass. Further work up showed involvement of the spinal cord, iliac crests, and kidneys. His initial blood work showed no hematological abnormalities. A bone marrow biopsy taken from the iliac crest demonstrated >90% B lymphoblasts and flow cytometry was positive for CD19. Overall, his investigations were consistent with a diagnosis of precursor B-cell ALL (pre B-ALL). His neuro-ophthalmic exam showed right-sided subtle periocular edema, decreased palpebral fissure height, and proptosis. Posterior exam showed mild nasal elevation of the right optic disc without vessel obscuration and mild tortuosity of the peripheral vessels. He otherwise had no overt signs of afferent or efferent dysfunction despite the proximity of the mass to his optic nerve and globe. This case demonstrates that high-risk pre B-ALL, a childhood cancer not commonly associated with orbital manifestations, can present with orbital edema and normal leukocyte count in an otherwise healthy child.",0
"Resveratrol in the fruits of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), the lowbush ""wild"" blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), the rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade), and the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) were measured using a new assay based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS assay provided lower limits of detection than previous methods for resveratrol measurement, 90 fmol of trans-resveratrol injected on-column, and a linear standard curve spanning >3 orders of magnitude. The recoveries of resveratrol from blueberries spiked with 1.8, 3.6, or 36 ng/g were 91.5 +/- 4.5, 95.6 +/- 6.5, and 88.0 +/- 3.6%, respectively. trans-Resveratrol but not cis-resveratrol was detected in both blueberry and bilberry samples. The highest levels of trans-resvertatrol in these specimens were 140.0 +/- 29.9 pmol/g in highbush blueberries from Michigan and 71.0 +/- 15.0 pmol/g in bilberries from Poland. However, considerable regional variation was observed; highbush blueberries from British Columbia contained no detectable resveratrol. Because blueberries and bilberries are often consumed after cooking, the effect of baking on resveratrol content was investigated. After 18 min of heating at 190 degrees C, between 17 and 46% of the resveratrol had degraded in the various Vaccinium species. Therefore, the resveratrol content of baked or heat-processed blueberries or bilberries should be expected to be lower than in the raw fruit. Although blueberries and bilberries were found to contain resveratrol, the level of this chemoprotective compound in these fruits was <10% that reported for grapes. Furthermore, cooking or heat processing of these berries will contribute to the degradation of resveratrol.",1
"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is the most important prognostic factor for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) however nearly 20-30% of patients relapsed even when they achieved negative MRD, how to identify these patients is less addressed. In this study, we aimed to reassess the prognostic significance of MRD and IKZF1 in adult B-ALL patients receiving pediatric chemotherapy regimens. A total of 202 newly diagnosed adult patients with B-ALL treated at Nanfang Hospital between January 2016 and September 2020 were enrolled in the population-based protocol of the PDT-ALL-2016 trial (NCT03564470), a GRAALL-backbone, peg-aspargase-intensified, antimetabolite-based pediatric-inspired regimen therapy. The validation dataset COG-P9906, which includes complete gene expression profiles and clinical data for 190 samples, is accessible via the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at the following link: (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), under the accession code GSE11877. B-ALL patients were redefined as standard (MRD-negative and IKZF1wild-type), intermediate (MRD-positive or IKZF1 deletion), and high-risk (MRD-positive and IKZF1 deletion) groups by combining IKZF1 deletion status and MRD. In the PDT-ALL-2016 cohort, patients in the high- and intermediate-risk groups who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) exhibited significantly improved 5-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) compared to those who received chemotherapy alone. In the PDT-ALL-2016 cohort, no significant advantage was observed in the 5-year OS, EFS, and CIR of patients in the standard-risk group who received allo-HSCT compared to those who received chemotherapy. Traditional risk factors, incorporating clinical and cytogenetic features, have been previously evaluated to stratify risks and guide treatment decisions. However, the prognostic strength of this stratified system is limited by the pediatric-inspired protocol background, making it difficult to identify patients with a high risk of relapse. Therefore, in the era of pediatric-inspired protocols, it is imperative to reassess traditional risk factors to identify patients at high risk of recurrence and mortality.In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the combination of MRD and IKZF1 to develop an efficient risk stratification tool for adult patients with B-ALL in the pediatric-inspired chemotherapy era. Moreover, allo-HSCT had distinct efficacy at different risk levels, which means that the decision to perform allo-HSCT may be well guided by this risk classification scheme. In conclusion, based on our cohort study and validation cohort, we demonstrated that the combination of MRD and IKZF1 deletion allows for better risk stratification of adults with B-ALL and that allo-HSCT mitigates the poor prognosis of MRD+ and/or IKZF1",0
"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) protein 1 (TAL1) is a central transcription factor in hematopoiesis. The timing and level of TAL1 expression orchestrate the differentiation to specialized blood cells and its overexpression is a common cause of T-ALL. Here, we studied the 2 protein isoforms of TAL1, short and long, which are generated by the use of alternative promoters as well as by alternative splicing. We analyzed the expression of each isoform by deleting an enhancer or insulator, or by opening chromatin at the enhancer location. Our results show that each enhancer promotes expression from a specific TAL1 promoter. Expression from a specific promoter gives rise to a unique 5' UTR with differential regulation of translation. Moreover, our study suggests that the enhancers regulate TAL1 exon 3 alternative splicing by inducing changes in the chromatin at the splice site, which we demonstrate is mediated by KMT2B. Furthermore, our results indicate that TAL1-short binds more strongly to TAL1 E-protein partners and functions as a stronger transcription factor than TAL1-long. Specifically TAL1-short has a unique transcription signature promoting apoptosis. Finally, when we expressed both isoforms in mice bone marrow, we found that while overexpression of both isoforms prevents lymphoid differentiation, expression of TAL1-short alone leads to hematopoietic stem cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we found that TAL1-short promoted erythropoiesis and reduced cell survival in the CML cell line K562. While TAL1 and its partners are considered promising therapeutic targets in the treatment of T-ALL, our results show that TAL1-short could act as a tumor suppressor and suggest that altering TAL1 isoform's ratio could be a preferred therapeutic approach.",0
"T-ALL is an aggressive hematological tumor that develops as the result of a multi-step oncogenic process which causes expansion of hematopoietic progenitors that are primed for T cell development to undergo malignant transformation and growth. Even though first-line therapy has a significant response rate, 40% of adult patients and 20% of pediatric patients will relapse. Therefore, there is an unmet need for treatment for relapsed/refractory T-ALL to develop potential targeted therapies. Pediatric T-ALL patient derived T cells were grown under either nonskewingTh0 or Th1-skewing conditions to further process for ChIP-qPCR, RDIP-qPCR and other RT-PCR assays. Endogenous WASp was knocked out using CRISPR-Cas9 and was confirmed using flow cytometry and western blotting. LC-MS/MS was performed to find out proteomic dataset of WASp-interactors generated from Th1-skewed, human primary Th-cells. DNA-damage was assessed by immunofluorescence confocal-imaging and single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Overexpression of RNaseH1 was also done to restore normal Th1-transcription in WASp-deficient Th1-skewed cells. We discovered that nuclear-WASp is required for suppressing R-loop production (RNA/DNA-hybrids) at Th1-network genes by ribonucleaseH2 (RNH2) and topoisomerase1. Nuclear-WASp is associated with the factors involved in preventing and dissolving R-loops in Th1 cells. In nuclear- WASp-reduced malignant Th1-cells, R-loops accumulate in vivo and are processed into DNA-breaks by transcription-coupled-nucleotide-excision repair (TC-NER). Several epigenetic modifications were also found to be involved at Th1 gene locus which are responsible for active/repressive marks of particular genes. By demonstrating WASp as a physiologic regulator of programmed versus unprogrammed R-loops, we suggest that the transcriptional role of WASp in vivo extends also to prevent transcription-linked DNA damage during malignancy and through modification of epigenetic dysregulations. Our findings present a provocative possibility of resetting R-loops as a therapeutic intervention to correct both immune deficiency and malignancy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and a novel role of WASp in the epigenetic regulation of T helper cell differentiation in T-ALL patients, anticipating WASp's requirement for the suppression of T-ALL progression.",0
"The aim of this research was to study the processing effects (roasting and boiling) on primary and secondary metabolite composition of fruits from the following chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) cultivars (cvs.) of three Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) areas in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region (Portugal): PDO Terra Fria (cvs. Aveleira, Boaventura, Côta, Lamela and Trigueira), PDO Padrela (cvs. Judia, Lada, Longal and Negra) and PDO Soutos da Lapa (cvs. Longal and Martaínha). The cooking processes significantly (p<0.0001) affected primary and secondary metabolite composition of the chestnuts. Roasted chestnuts had higher protein contents, insoluble and total dietary fibre and lower fat contents whilst boiled chestnuts had lower protein, but higher fat contents. Cooking increased citric acid contents, especially in roasted chestnuts. On the other hand, raw chestnuts had higher malic acid contents than cooked chestnuts. Moreover, roasted chestnuts had significantly higher gallic acid and total phenolics contents, and boiled chestnuts had higher gallic and ellagic acids contents, when compared to raw chestnuts. The present data confirms that cooked chestnuts are a good source of organic acids and phenolics and have low fat contents, properties that are associated with positive health benefits.",1

"The antioxidative activity of a total of 92 phenolic extracts from edible and nonedible plant materials (berries, fruits, vegetables, herbs, cereals, tree materials, plant sprouts, and seeds) was examined by autoxidation of methyl linoleate. The content of total phenolics in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents (GAE). Among edible plant materials, remarkable high antioxidant activity and high total phenolic content (GAE > 20 mg/g) were found in berries, especially aronia and crowberry. Apple extracts (two varieties) showed also strong antioxidant activity even though the total phenolic contents were low (GAE < 12.1 mg/g). Among nonedible plant materials, high activities were found in tree materials, especially in willow bark, spruce needles, pine bark and cork, and birch phloem, and in some medicinal plants including heather, bog-rosemary, willow herb, and meadowsweet. In addition, potato peel and beetroot peel extracts showed strong antioxidant effects. To utilize these significant sources of natural antioxidants, further characterization of the phenolic composition is needed.",1
"BACKGROUND Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is a rare, fibroproliferative disorder within the mediastinum. It is extremely rare for hematologic malignancies to develop as FM. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old Japanese man with a 1-month history of headache and 2-week history of facial swelling underwent chest computed tomography (CT); a diffuse mass-like lesion was revealed in the anterior mediastinum with severe stenosis of vital mediastinal organs. After a surgical biopsy, an initial diagnosis of idiopathic FM was made. The FM lesions responded mildly to corticosteroids but recurred repeatedly. Sixteen months after the treatment initiation, blasts appeared in the peripheral blood (PB), and the patient was diagnosed with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL). Chemotherapy led to complete remission of the B-ALL/LBL and almost complete disappearance of FM-like lesions. Immunohistochemistry of the mediastinal biopsy specimen taken before the blasts' appearance in PB demonstrated a CD34/CD7/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive population, an identical pattern of expression common to the blasts in the patient's PB and bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case report of B-ALL/LBL presenting as FM. This case underscores the importance of considering the possibility of latent hematologic malignancy even in the absence of new symptoms other than those caused by FM lesions for a long period of time. This is the first demonstration that leukemia cells may be present in the FM lesions from the initial stage of disease onset. Even if a diagnosis of idiopathic FM is confirmed, continued suspicion of the presence of hematologic malignancy is vital for improving patient outcomes.",0
"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different blanching times on the antioxidant properties (antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities) and phenolic content of selected cruciferous vegetables. The study revealed that a 10-min blanching time had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the antioxidant properties and phenolic content of all the vegetables except for cabbage and mustard cabbage. The loss of antioxidant activity was highest in Chinese cabbage (40%) after 15 min of blanching, followed by cabbage (27%), Chinese white cabbage (19%), mustard cabbage (9%) and red cabbage (4%). Red cabbage had lost a total of 40% scavenging activity after 15 min of blanching followed by Chinese cabbage (38%), cabbage (36%), mustard cabbage (23%) and Chinese white cabbage (11%). Only Chinese cabbage showed an increase (p < 0.05) in total phenolic content after 15 min of blanching compared with other vegetables. Minimal heat treatment through blanching process is recommended to prevent the major loss of antioxidant properties and phenolic content in selected cruciferous vegetables.

"Cereal Chem. 67(5):413-417 Wheat samples from the United States and Canada and flours from Linear regression analysis between protein and alkylresorcinol content those wheats were analyzed for alkylresorcinols. Alkylresorcinols in wheats indicated that they are negatively correlated. Wheat type had no effect ranged from 317.5 to 655.0 ,4g/g dry weight. Flours contained very small on flour alkylresorcinol content. Patent percentage of flours was shown amounts of alkylresorcinols and the values ranged from 0.025 to 14.45 to be positively correlated with the amount of alkylresorcinols. Both kernel )ug/g dry weight. Generally, hard wheats had higher protein and lower maturity and cereal types influenced the amount of alkylresorcinols. As alkylresorcinols; soft wheat had lower protein and higher alkylresorcinols. maturity increased, alkylresorcinol content decreased. A group of compounds known to inhibit growth in several animal species has been isolated from cereal grains (Wieringa 1967, Evans et al 1973, Pawlik 1979, Sedlet et al 1984) and identified as resorcinol derivatives with hydrocarbon chains at the fifth position. Cereal alkylresorcinols were found to be mixtures of saturated, monoenoic, and dienoic homologs with 13-29 carbon side chains (Wieringa 1967; Kozubek 1984b, 1987a; Seitz and Love 1987). The C21, C23, C25, C27, and C29 homologs were observed in rye oil (Briggs 1974). In wheat bran, the C25 and C27 components were found to be predominant (Wenkert et al 1964). Wieringa (1967) states that factors such as soil type, fertilization, and weather may influence the content of alkylresorcinols. Cereal grains grown under the same agronomic and climatic conditions during consecutive crop years showed only slight variations from year to year. However, Verdeal and Lorenz (1977) found that alkylresorcinol content decreases in rye and triticale as the grains mature. Alkylresorcinols are present quite early in kernel development, and the apparent decrease in proportion of alkylresorcinols may be a dilution effect, partly due to deposition of starch and protein in developing grain kernels. By milling wheat, rye, and triticale into bran, shorts, and flour fractions, and subsequent analysis, Verdeal and Lorenz (1977) and Salek (1978) showed the bran to contain the highest alkylresorcinol level. Intermediate values were found in the shorts, whereas the flour fractions produced relatively low values. This indicates that a gradient exists with the highest amounts of the compounds in the pericarp, intermediate amounts in the aleurone layer, and relatively small but detectable amounts in the endosperm portion of cereal grain kernels. Seitz and Love (1987) suggested that analyses of alkylresorcinols in milling fractions could be a useful measure of bran contamination in flours. Generally, the amount of alkylresorcinols in cereals is highest in rye, lower in wheat and triticale, and very low in other cereals such as oats, barley, and corn (Verdeal and Lorenz 1977, Musehold 1978, Kozubek and Demel 1980). However, some varieties of wheat have an alkylresorcinol content similar to that of rye. Selection of cultivar progeny was effective in increasing or decreasing alkylresorcinol content (Evans et al 1973). Thus far, these compounds have only been suspected to be detrimental factors in animal nutrition, although concern has occasionally been raised about possible ill-effects on humans in European countries with high rye bread consumption (Anonymous 1974). There are no established human toxicity levels for these compounds. In model studies, alkylresorcinols were shown to cause red blood cell hemolysis, permeability changes of erythrocytes and liposomes to small solutes, and DNA strand scission, and to be involved in many pathological conditions (Kozubek 1984a, 1987b; Kozubek and Demel 1980; Kozubek et al 1988).",1
"This study was carried out to investigate the impact of high pressure processing (HPP) at different pressure (200, 400 and 600 MPa) and treatment times (5, 9 and 15 min) on ascorbic acid, total phenolics, anthocyanin stability and total antioxidant capacity, were also studied at different physicochemical parameters such as pH, °Brix and color. HPP treatments resulted in more than 92% vitamin C retention at all treatment intensities. On the other hand, total phenolic content in the juice was increased, mainly after HPP at 200 MPa for all treatment times. The total and monomeric anthocyanin were similar or higher than the value estimated for the fresh juice being maximum at 400 MPa/15 min (16% increase). Antioxidant capacity values were not statistically different for treatments at 200 MPa for 5–15 min in comparison with fresh juice, however for 400 MPa/15 min and 600 MPa for all times (8–16% reduction), the lowest values were observed for total antioxidant capacity determined with TEAC method. No significant changes were observed in pH and °Brix. Color changes (a*, b*, L* and ΔE) were not visually noticeable for pressurized beverage for all pressures and times.",1
"The precise segmentation of white blood cells (WBCs) within blood smear images is a significant challenge with implications for both medical research and image processing. Of particular importance is the often neglected task of accurately segmenting WBC nuclei, an aspect that currently lacks dedicated methodologies. This paper introduces a straightforward and efficient method designed to fill this critical gap, providing an effective solution for the efficient segmentation of WBC nuclei. In blood smear imagery, the distinctive coloration of WBCs contrasts with the hues of other blood components. The inherent obscurity of WBCs prompts their segmentation by isolating pixels with minimal intensities. To streamline this process, our proposed method employs the Laplacian pyramid technique to decorrelate pixels in blood smear images, thereby amplifying the contrast. Subsequently, the intensities of pixels constituting blood cells, encompassing WBCs and the background, are modeled using three Gaussian random variables. Capitalizing on this feature, we implement the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) clustering method to determine the optimal threshold value, facilitating a highly precise segmentation of WBC nuclei. The proposed method demonstrates the capability to process images containing a single WBC as well as effectively functioning with images containing multiple cells of this type. Evaluation of the method on the ALL-IDB, ALL-IDB2, CellaVision, and JTSC datasets yielded accuracy values of 0.9802, 0.9725, 0.9772, and 0.9730, respectively. Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods revealed a notably comparable performance, underscoring the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The method presented in this article is highly competitive for segmenting the nuclei of WBCs compared to state-of-the-art methods. The three main advantages of our method are its ability to process images containing one or more WBCs, the automatic calculation of threshold values for each processed image, eliminating the need for manual parameter adjustments. Lastly, the method is efficient, as its algorithmic complexity is approximately",0
"To identify and quantify biologically active components in rat serum after orally administrating the decoction of Bulpleurum falcatum L. and Fractus aurantii, one of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated. The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).",1
"The lack of information on drug-drug interactions in the pediatric population significantly complicates making effective therapeutic decisions. Our study aimed to analyze the rate and risk factors as well as present potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) specifically for pediatric patients from the pediatric hemato-oncologic unit, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. We conducted a six-month prospective study in which clinical pharmacists examined medical records once a week to look for pDDIs using the Lexicomp We identified 507 pDDIs in 119 screened patients, 388 of which were clinically relevant. Nearly 68% of the patients were exposed to at least one significant interaction. The number of pDDIs was positively correlated with the number of medications (r Limited data on drug-drug interactions in the pediatric population emphasizes the need for close collaboration between clinical pharmacists and clinicians to improve the safety and effectiveness of pharmacotherapy.",0
"The antioxidant compounds from commercial bananas, Musa Cavendish, were studied. One of the antioxidants, gallocatechin, was identified in the banana. The gallocatechin was isolated (using HPLC) from the banana peel extract, which showed strong antioxidant activity. Gallocatechin was more abundant in peel (158 mg/100 g dry wt.) than in pulp (29.6 mg/100 g dry wt.). The antioxidant activity of the banana peel extract, against lipid autoxidation, was stronger than that of the banana pulp extract. This result was consistent with the gallocatechin analysis. The higher gallocatechin content may account for the better antioxidant effects. Thus, the antioxidant capacity of the bananas may be attributed to their gallocatechin content. Bananas should be considered as a good source of natural antioxidants for foods.",1
"T cell malignancies pose several unique issues for CAR-T cell therapy that were not significant concerns with CAR-T cells for B-cell malignancies. A general problem to consider in the production of CAR-T cells is ""on target-off tumor toxicity."" This occurs when the antigen targeted by the CAR-T cells is also expressed on normal cells, not just tumor cells, which causes CAR-T cells to damage these normal cells. In CAR-T cell therapy for T cell tumors, antigens expressed on T cells (such as CD5, CD7, etc.) are the targets, which leads to a problem known as ""fratricide,"" where CAR-T cells kill each other. Other issues include T cell aplasia and contamination of CAR-T cell products with tumor cells. However, several recent clinical trials have shown excellent outcomes for CAR-T cell therapy when genome editing technology is used to overcome these issues by knocking out target antigens or T cell receptors. This review article outlines these challenges and their solutions and discusses the results of recent clinical trials.",0
"We present a simultaneous liquid chromatographic method for the separation of two flavonoid compound families, flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs), which are usually found in citrus fruits species and varieties. This technique permits the quantitation of six FGs (narirutin, naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, didymin, poncirin) and six PMFs (sinensetin, hexamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, scutellarein, heptamethoxyflavone and tangeretin). This technique, to be used to characterize a citrus juice by its polyphenolic profile, has been applied to the determination of flavonoid compounds in grapefruit- and orange juice. Differentiation of orange juice varieties and mixtures containing tangor juice using polyphenolic profiles and flavonoid content has been achieved.",1
"Six flavone glycosides were separated by HPLC using RP-18 with a quaternary mobile phase mixture [water-acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran-acetic acid (80:16:3:1, v/v)]. This procedure was applied to the separation and determination of the most important flavanone glycosides contained in pure grapefruit and sour orange juices and mixtures. This method can be used for quality control of industrial concentrates and juices.",1
"Analyses of phenolic acids, aldehydes and benzoic acid were carried out using GLC and MS techniques on the peel and peeled tuber of potato cv. Bintje, Magnum Bonum, Sabina, Ukama, Stina and Sv70102. Chlorogenic acid was determined by spectrophotometry. Caffeic, protocatechuic and ferulic acids were found in the peel and peeled tubers of all cv. and vanillic and syringic acids in the peel of all cv. Benzoic and sinapic acids were detected only in the peel of Sabina and Sv 70102, resp. Caffeic, ferulic and p-coumaric acids were generally found conjugated to the extracted residue from peel. Ferulic acid was the only conjugated acid detected in residues from the peeled tubers of all cv. Chlorogenic acid content varied considerably between cv. (4.1-17.3% in peel, 0.4-2.7% in peeled tuber) but agreed with previous results. Bintje and Magnum Bonum (susceptible to Phoma exigua var. foveata) had a higher ratio of chlorogenic acid to other phenolics than the other, more resistant cv. 3 aldehydes not previously reported in potato tubers were detected in the free form. Protocatechualdehyde was found in all cv., vanillin in all but the peeled tuber of Bintje and Magnum Bonum, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde in only a few samples. Vanillin was also detected after hydrolysis of extracted residues from the peel of all cv.",1
"Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to mammalian lignans is suggested.",1

"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is currently treated with bacterial L-asparaginase; however, its side effects raise the need for the development of improved and efficient novel enzymes. Previously, we obtained low anti-asparaginase antibody production and high serum enzyme half-life in mice treated with the P40S/S206C mutant; however, its specific activity was significantly reduced. Thus, our aim was to test single mutants, S206C and P40S, through in vitro and in vivo assays. Our results showed that the drop in specific activity was caused by P40S substitution. In addition, our single mutants were highly stable in biological environment simulation, unlike the double-mutant P40S/S206C. The in vitro cell viability assay demonstrated that mutant enzymes have a higher cytotoxic effect than WT on T-cell-derived ALL and on some solid cancer cell lines. The in vivo assays were performed in mice to identify toxicological effects, to evoke immunological responses and to study the enzymes' pharmacokinetics. From these tests, none of the enzymes was toxic; however, S206C elicited lower physiological changes and immune/allergenic responses. In relation to the pharmacokinetic profile, S206C exhibited twofold higher activity than WT and P40S two hours after injection. In conclusion, we present bioengineered",0
"The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.",1
"Phenolic compounds in 21 grape cultivars grown in New York during the 1985 season were analyzed by using column chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography. Trans-caffeoyl tartaric acid, cis-coumaroyl tartaric acid, and trans-coumaroyl tartaric acid were the major components of acidic phenolics, while catechin, epicatechin, and two unidentified compounds were the major constituents in the neutral phenolics. One of the unidentified compounds was tentatively identified as a catechin-gallate and the others as isomers of catechin-catechin-gallate. There were large differences in the phenolic make-up of the individual cultivars. Mean values of individual phenolics were higher in the New York grapes than in those from the western United States and Europe.",1
"A rapid and sensitive capillary electrophoretic method for analysis of resveratrol in wine was established. The protocol consists of sample preparation using a C-18 solid-phase extraction cartridge. Baseline separation of trans- and cis-resveratrol from other compounds in wine was achieved in approximately 8 min using a micellar mode. The limits of detection for trans- and cis-resveratrol were 0.1 and 0.15 micromol/L, respectively. Recovery rates for trans-resveratrol using the protocol described ranged from 94.6 +/- 8.5 to 101.9 +/- 7.2%. These procedures were used to analyze the trans- and cis-resveratrol levels in 26 wines. It was found that the concentration of trans-resveratrol ranged from 0.987 to 25.4 micromol/L, whereas the concentration of cis-resveratrol was much lower.",1
"Five different varieties of greek table olives (Kalamon, Tsakistes, Crete, Amfissas and Thrubes Crete) were investigated for the total polyphenol content and phenolic compounds, humidity, fat and total antioxidant capacity. Analysis was performed on the flesh and kernel of the table olives. Total polyphenol content was estimated with the Folin–Ciocalteau assay, humidity with freeze drying and total fat with Soxhlet extraction. Qualitative analysis of phenols and phenolic acids was performed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and thirteen compounds were identified in flesh as well in kernel except of oleanolic acid. Finally the antioxidant activity of olives was assessed by scavenging of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPHradical dot) radical. Total antioxidant capacity is in descending order: Tsakistes > Amfissas > Kalamon > Crete > Thrubes Crete. By the present work, the consumption of table olives, is considered to offer a high intake of antioxidants, mainly polyphenols, and so a health benefit for the prevention of many decadent diseases.",1
"T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) is a highly aggressive form of ALL with at least 25% relapse rates. The high relapse rates are often linked to poor prognoses. More detailed studies for novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of T-ALL are required as the genetic and transcriptomic data currently available on T-ALL pathophysiology is insufficient. Long non-coding RNAs are emerging as important players in the regulation of tumour proliferation and metastasis. Studies on various cancers have revealed their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in treatment. This review describes the characterization, biosynthesis, and role of long non-coding RNA in T-ALL and highlights their potential as next generation molecule in development of promising diagnostic, prognostic and/or therapeutic markers.",0
"Minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment using peripheral blood instead of bone marrow aspirate/biopsy specimen or the biopsy of the cancerous infiltrated by lymphoid malignancies is an emerging technique with enormous interest of research and technological innovation at the current time. In some lymphoid malignancies (particularly ALL), Studies have shown that MRD monitoring of the peripheral blood may be an adequate alternative to frequent BM aspirations. However, additional studies investigating the biology of liquid biopsies in ALL and its potential as an MRD marker in larger patient cohorts in treatment protocols are warranted. Despite the promising data, there are still limitations in liquid biopsies in lymphoid malignancies, such as standardization of the sample collection and processing, determination of timing and duration for liquid biopsy analysis, and definition of the biological characteristics and specificity of the techniques evaluated such as flow cytometry, molecular techniques, and next generation sequencies. The use of liquid biopsy for detection of minimal residual disease in T-cell lymphoma is still experimental but it has made significant progress in multiple myeloma for example. Recent attempt to use artificial intelligence may help simplify the algorithm for testing and may help avoid inter-observer variation and operator dependency in these highly technically demanding testing process.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a hematologic cancer that begins in the bone marrow and results in an overproduction of lymphocytes. It can present as palpable purpura, which is also seen in many other pathologies, including vasculitides such as IgA vasculitis. We present a case of a 52-year-old male who presented to our hospital from an outside facility specifically for plasma exchange for treating a previously diagnosed IgA vasculitis. After being admitted for further evaluation, it was noted that the patient had a diffuse petechial non-blanching purpuric rash bilaterally covering the lower extremities, trunk, upper extremities, and tongue. The patient was also noted to have severe pancytopenia. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated the presence of t(9:22), indicating Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement. The patient was diagnosed with ALL. The patient underwent induction chemotherapy and was continued on hyper-CVAD protocol with intrathecal chemotherapy. The patient appeared to respond well to treatment and is currently undergoing subsequent intermittent chemotherapy. In this case, the diagnosis of B-cell ALL (B-ALL) blast crisis was pivotal in providing the correct therapy to this patient, and the case demonstrated that even rare presentations of B-ALL in this population with rare mutations responds avidly to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",0
"Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins [(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.",1
"The flavonoids, naringin and naringenin and the furanocoumarin, bergapten (5-methoxypsoralen), were detected in some fresh grapefruit and commercial grapefruit juices but were not detected in other fruit juices tested (orange; orange with apple base; dark grape; orange and mango with apple base; orange, peach, passion fruit juice). The contents of these three grapefruit constituents in commercial juice and fresh grapefruit varied from brand to brand and also from lot to lot. Juice was prepared from the fresh fruit via different methods (by hand, squeezer or blender). The naringin content, after hand-squeeze, ranged from 115 to 384 mg/l. With hand-squeeze juice production, bergapten was not detected (less than 0.5 mg/l) in two varieties of grapefruit, and naringenin was usually not in detectable levels (less than 2 mg/l) in three varieties. All three constituents were present in New Zealand grapefruit preparations (including juice by hand-squeeze) and different lots showed variation in content (1.5-, 2.3- and 4.7-fold for naringin, naringenin and bergapten, respectively). Differences in the concentrations of these three constituents, which have potential for drug interaction, may contribute to the variability in pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 drugs and some contradictory results of drug interaction studies with grapefruit juice.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent malignant hematologic disease characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature lymphocytes in bone marrow and lymphoid tissues. In our study, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing was performed to investigate four types of methylation modifications-6 mA, CHG, CHH, and CpG-in a pair of monozygotic twins, where one twin has ALL and the other is healthy. The results showed the significant global hypomethylation of CpG sites and an increase in 6 mA, CHG, and CHH methylation in the twin diagnosed with ALL. Notably, the hypomethylation of CpG was particularly increased in the open sea, gene body, and 3'UTR regions, while 6 mA and CHG modifications exhibited high methylation levels in the gene body, TSS1500, TSS200, and 3'UTR regions. Additionally, CHH modifications showed high methylation across all genomic regions. Within the differential methylation loci (DML), we identified several genes related to tumorigenesis and progression (such as ZDHHC11, NBPF1, and TPTE). Furthermore, we systemically reviewed the literatures on leukemia and DNA methylation modifications, providing a comprehensive description of their correlation. In summary, these findings indicate that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of ALL, offering valuable insights for future research into its impact on leukemia development.",0
"Recent advances in ultra-low coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of single cells have enabled detailed analysis of copy number variation at a throughput approaching that of single-cell RNA sequencing. However, downstream computational methods have not seen comparable advances and are largely adaptations of deep sequencing methodology with reduced precision. Here, we present ASCENT, a computational method built to take full advantage of modern direct tagmentation-based WGS at ultra-low depth. Using joint segmentation with high-resolution bins, we accurately detect small segments, achieving accurate copy number profiles even at 100 000 reads per cell. ASCENT implements true absolute copy state inference for single cells, based on statistical modeling of coverage rather than comparison to a reference, while taking variable segment copy state into account. Further, ASCENT implements per-segment copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) calling without the need for non-tumor or bulk WGS reference. When applied to a pediatric B-ALL sample, ASCENT finds copy-neutral LOH in a small segment and a minor subclone defined by breakpoints missed in bulk WGS. Thus, by applying appropriate computational methods, single-cell WGS provides clear advantages over bulk, even at a relatively low cell number and sequencing depth.",0
"Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzymatic activity has been proposed as a marker for distinguishing canine acute leukaemia (AL) subtypes (i.e., myeloid vs. lymphoid). However, ALP enzymatic activity has not been fully evaluated in CD34+ AL. Determine whether ALP enzymatic activity can differentiate CD34+ AL subtypes in dogs and distinguish CD34+ AL from CD34- haematopoietic tumours in tissue/effusion samples. Peripheral blood from 64 dogs with CD34+ AL, 10 with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and 10 healthy controls were prospectively evaluated for ALP enzymatic activity via cytochemical staining; a subset also underwent ALP detection by flow cytometry (FC). Archived cytology slides from 67 tissue/effusion specimens, including 27 CD34+ AL, 22 T cell lymphomas, and 18 B cell lymphomas, were retrospectively assessed. CD34+ AL cases were categorised as acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) or acute unclassifiable leukaemia (AUL) by established FC criteria. ALP positivity was defined as > 3% ALP+ neoplastic cells, which was selected based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Cytochemical ALP activity was detected in 61/64 (95.3%) CD34+ AL cases, with no significant differences between AML, ALL, and AUL subtypes (p > 0.05). All lymphoma and B cell CLL cases were ALP-negative. FC-based ALP analysis showed poor concordance with cytochemistry, and the correlation between %CD34 + ALP+ cells and %ALP+ neoplastic cells was weak (Spearman's ρ = 0.25). While ALP enzymatic activity is present in most CD34+ AL cases, it does not reliably differentiate CD34+ AL subtypes via cytochemistry. However, ALP may help distinguish CD34+ AL from B and T cell lymphomas. FC-based ALP analysis is not a reliable marker for CD34+ AL classification.",0
"An analysis of the limonin and naringin content of 6685 grapefruit juice samples (representing approximately 6% of all grapefruit harvested) collected from three Florida State Test Houses showed that there were statistically significant differences between the Test Houses. There also was a statistically significant difference in the concentration of these compounds in the juice from the different cultivars of fruit sampled. Average limonin and naringin concentrations in the juice remained fairly constant through the beginning of the season until a freeze occurred in early 1981. Juice obtained from fruit harvsted after this freeze contained decreasing amounts of limonin and increasing amounts of naringin through the remainder of the season. Results showed that there was no strong correlative relationship between limonin, naringin, Brix, percent acid, and Brix/acid ratio. ",1
"The concentration and distribution of isoflavones in 29 commercial soybean foods, categorized into soy ingredients, traditional and second-generation, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography and photodiode array detection. Twelve isomers were quantified, three aglycons (daidzein, genistein, glycitein) and nine glucosides (daidzin, genistin, glycitin; 6'-O-acetyldaidzin, -genistin, -glycitin; 6'-O-malonyldaidzin, -genistin, -glycitin). Compared with unprocessed soybeans, high-protein soy ingredients contained similar concentrations, except alcohol-leached soy concentrate. Traditional soybean foods showed differences between nonfermented and fermented foods. Nonfermented foods had greater levels of glucosides, while in contrast, greater levels of aglycons were found in fermented foods. Second-generation soy foods contained only 6-20% of the isoflavones of whole soybeans. The variety of soybean, method of processing, and addition of other components affect the retention and distribution of isoflavone isomers in soy foods.",1
"Biophenolic compounds constitute a complex mixture in olives and derived products. In this work, ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography is applied to the identification and quantification of biophenols present in complex matrices such as olives and vegetation waters. The extraction and purification method for the biophenol present in both the matrices is reported. Using this approach the main biophenols found, in three different variety of olives, were: tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleoside methyl ester, oleoside dimethyl ester, and oleuropein. In vegetation water the biophenols are present in lower amounts than in olives.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common cancer affecting children worldwide. The development of ALL is driven by several genes, some of which can be targeted for treatment by inhibiting gene fusions. PAX5 is frequently mutated in ALL and is involved in chromosomal rearrangements and translocations. Mutations in PAX5 interact with other genes, such as ETV6 and FOXP1, which influence B-cell development. PAX5/ETV6 has been observed in both B-ALL patients and a mouse model. The interaction between PAX5 and FOXP1 negatively suppresses the Pax5 gene in B-ALL patients. Additionally, ELN and PML genes have been found to fuse with PAX5, leading to adverse effects on B-cell differentiation. ELN-PAX5 interaction results in the decreased expression of LEF1, MB1, and BLNK, while PML-PAX5 is critical in the early stages of leukemia. PAX5 fusion genes prevent the transcription of the PAX5 gene, making it an essential target gene for the study of leukemia progression and the diagnosis of B-ALL.",0
"Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the gut.",1
"Two commercial samples of soft (70% Canadian Eastern soft red spring and 30% Canadian Eastern soft white winter) and hard (90% Canadian western hard red spring and 10% Canadian Eastern hard red winter) wheats were used to obtain different milling fractions. Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or +/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 +/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is essential.",1
"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) maintenance therapy with or without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first remission (CR1). A literature search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinical trials.gov. After screening 1720 articles, 12 studies were included. Proportions and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed. I",0
" Total anthocyanins, total phenolics, and the antioxidant activities of 1 sour cherry cultivar (Prunus cerasusL.) and 3 sweet cherry cultivars (P. aviumL.) were determined. Bing cherries were highest in anthocyanins, whereas Montmorency cherries were highest in total phenolics and antioxidant activities (oxygen radical absor-bance capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power). Total phenolics and anthocyanins for all cultivars were concentrated in the skin. More than 75% of anthocyanins in frozen Bing cherries were destroyed after 6 mo of storage at -23°C. During canning, about half the anthocyanins and polyphenolics leached from the fruits into the syrup with little total loss. Spent cherry brine contained substantial anthocyanins and polyphenolics.",1
"Despite the fact that mankind has been drinking tea for more than 5000 years, its chemical composition has been studied only in recent decades. These studies are primarily carried out using chromatographic methods. This review summarizes the latest information regarding the chemical composition of different tea grades by different chromatographic methods, which has not previously been reviewed in the same scope. Over the last 40 years, the qualitative and quantitative analyses of high volatile compounds were determined by GC and GC/MS. The main components responsible for aroma of green and black tea were revealed, and the low volatile compounds basically were determined by HPLC and LC/MS methods. Most studies focusing on the determination of catechins and caffeine in various teas (green, oolong, black and pu-erh) involved HPLC analysis. Knowledge of tea chemical composition helps in assessing its quality on the one hand, and helps to monitor and manage its growing, processing, and storage conditions on the other. In particular, this knowledge has enabled to establish the relationships between the chemical composition of tea and its properties by identifying the tea constituents which determine its aroma and taste. Therefore, assessment of tea quality does not only rely on subjective organoleptic evaluation, but also on objective physical and chemical methods, with extra determination of tea components most beneficial to human health. With this knowledge, the nutritional value of tea may be increased, and tea quality improved by providing via optimization of the growing, processing, and storage conditions.",1
"This study investigated the effects of processing and storage on the stability of purified, flaxseed-derived secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) added to milk prior to the manufacture of different dairy products. We analyzed the effect of high-temperature pasteurization, fermentation, and milk renneting as well as storage on the stability of SDG added to milk, yogurt, and cheese. Also, the stability of SDG in whey-based drinks was studied. Added SDG was found to withstand the studied processes well. In edam cheese manufacture, most of the added SDG was retained in the whey fraction and 6% was found in the cheese curd. SDG was also relatively stable in edam cheese during ripening of 6 weeks at 9 degrees C and in yogurt during storage of 21 days at 4 degrees C. Up to 25% of added SDG was lost in whey-based drinks during storage of 6 months at 8 degrees C. We conclude that SDG can be successfully supplemented in dairy-based products.",1
"Qualitative and quantitative analyses of phenolic compounds were carried out on quince fruit samples from seven different geographical origins in Portugal. For each origin, both pulp and peel were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC-DAD and HPLC-DAD/MS. The results revealed differences between the phenolic profiles of pulps and peels in all studied cases. The pulps contained mainly caffeoylquinic acids (3-, 4-, and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acids and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid) and one quercetin glycoside, rutin (in low amount). The peels presented the same caffeoylquinic acids and several flavonol glycosides: quercetin 3-galactoside, kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-rutinoside, and several unidentified compounds (probably kaempferol glycoside and quercetin and kaempferol glycosides acylated with p-coumaric acid). The highest content of phenolics was found in peels.",1
"Quercetin content in onion (Allium cepa L.), represented mainly by 3,4′-O-quercetin diglucoside (3,4′-Qdg) and 4′-O-quercetin glucoside (4′-Qmg), was examined in five cultivars before and after three cooking treatments (sautéing, baking, and boiling). Baking and sautéing produced a 7–25% gain in quercetin concentration, while boiling produced an 18% decrease in quercetin concentration. Ratios of 3,4′-Qdg to 4′-Qmg in tissues ranged from 1:1.3 and 1:1.7, and combined the two conjugates represented 89–90% of total flavonol content in treatment and raw control means indicating heat stability of the flavonols. Changes in flavonol concentrations as a result of cooking method were consistent across all five cultivars.",1
"The 5-year event-free survival rate for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has increased to more than 85%. However, the 5-year overall survival rate in children with relapsed/refractory ALL did not exceed 50%. In the past decade, immunotherapies (such as blinatumomab and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy) were approved for relapsed/refractory B-ALL, transforming the treatment environment for children with relapsed/refractory ALL. This study aimed to explore how immunotherapy can be incorporated into salvage regimens for pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory ALL by retrospectively analyzing the diagnosis and treatment process of seven children with relapsed/refractory leukemia and observing the side effects of the two strategies and long-term survival. The clinical features and treatment responses of patients aged <14 years with relapsed/refractory leukemia who received immunotherapy (including Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell treatment and blinatumomab) at Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology between February 2014 and April 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Seven children underwent immunotherapy. Five patients received immunotherapy and sequential allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), whereas the other two received only immunotherapy. Five patients achieved complete remission (71.4%). None of the patients had severe cytokine release syndrome. However, one developed grade 3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome with prior leukoencephalopathy. The median follow-up period was 541 days (range, 186-3,180 days). No deaths were related to treatment. Three patients relapsed, two had CD19-negative recurrences, and the third showed CD19 antigen reduction. One patient died after disease progression, whereas the other died of HSCT-related complications. One patient abandoned the treatment after relapse and was lost to follow-up. Blinatumomab and CAR T-cell therapy showed excellent remission rates and manageable toxicity in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia. However, the duration of the remission was limited. Therefore, further prospective randomized clinical studies should be conducted to improve the long-term efficacy of immunotherapy.",0
"Invasive fungal diseases (IFD) in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) are poorly characterized, especially in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to identify the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of IFD in a pediatric cohort with ALL/LBL. We retrospectively analyzed pediatric patients diagnosed with ALL/LBL between January and December 2023 at a tertiary cancer center in India. Patients were risk-stratified and treated per the modified ICiCLe-ALL-14 protocol. IFDs were classified as proven, probable, and possible according to the revised EORTC/MSG consensus definition. Among 407 patients, 392(96%) had ALL. The overall incidence of IFD was 25%, with probable/proven infections in 12%. Mold infections predominated (79 cases, 77%), followed by yeast infections (21 cases, 21%). In comparison with patients without IFDs, those with IFDs were more likely to have received dexamethasone (30 vs. 20%; p = 0.009), anthracycline (28 vs. 14%; p = 0.001) during induction and have central venous access (27 vs. 18%; p = 0.008). The 6-week mortality rate of patients with IFD was 15%, rising to 26% in probable/proven cases. Coexisting bacterial infection was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio: 19.2[95%CI: 3.5-105]; p = 0.001). IFDs are common in newly diagnosed ALL/LBL patients in LMICs, particularly during early phases of therapy. These infections are associated with considerable mortality, often compounded by concomitant bacterial sepsis. Given these findings, consideration of antifungal prophylaxis is warranted to mitigate morbidity and mortality due to IFDs.",0
"Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.",1
"Evaluating the performance of low-light image enhancement (LLE) is highly subjective, thus making integrating human preferences into LLE a necessity. Existing methods fail to consider this and present a series of potentially valid heuristic criteria for training LLE models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, i.e., aesthetics-guided low-light image enhancement (ALL-E), which introduces aesthetic preferences to LLE and motivates training in a reinforcement learning framework with an aesthetic reward. Each pixel, functioning as an agent, refines itself by recursive actions. We further present ALL-E+, an extended version of ALL-E, which casts a two-stage aesthetics-guided enhancement and denoising. ALL-E+ achieves low-light enhancement and denoising compensation sequentially in a unified framework, resulting in significant improvements in both subjective visual experience and objective evaluation. Extensive experiments show that integrating aesthetic preferences can further improve the visual experience of enhanced images. Our results on various benchmarks also demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.",0
"Berry extracts rich in anthocyanins have been linked to protective effects including the modulation of age-related neurological dysfunction and the improvement of the resistance of red blood cells against oxidative stress in vitro. In this study the bioavailability, metabolism and elimination of polyphenols from blackcurrant juice, rich in anthocyanins, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamates, were investigated. The four major native anthocyanidin glycosides of blackcurrant juice, delphinidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, were detected and identified in low amounts by HPLC and LC-MS in plasma and urine post-ingestion. Elimination of the anthocyanins was fast (maximum excretion after 1 h) and plasma levels (0-128.6 nmol/l) and total urinary exretion (0.07-1.35 mg; 0.007-0.133% of the dose ingested) were low. Most significantly, of the hydroxycinnamates, conjugated and free ferulic, isoferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic and vanillic acids were identified in plasma and urine, using GC-MS techniques. Quercetin and kaempferol (as glucuronides) and the proposed colonic metabolite of quercetin, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, were detectable in a minority of subjects. Increased daily urinary hippuric, 4-hydroxyhippuric and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid levels were also observed post-ingestion in all volunteers.",1
"CD7-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy has shown great promise in the treatment of relapsed/refractory T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In this study, we reported a case of a 34-year-old male patient with T-ALL who finally developed multi-line drug resistance and refractoriness after multiple lines of high-intensity chemotherapy. After physician evaluation, this patient received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Then, The patient remained in complete remission (CR) for four months before a relapse with 26.64% chimerism rate, so he was treated with allogeneic anti-CD7 CAR-T cells after chemotherapy reducing the tumor burden. The CAR-T product was a novel anti-CD7 CAR-T based on retroviral vectors (RV). After infusion, the patient achieved CR within 1 month after anti-CD7 CAR-T infusion and the remission has been ongoing for 9 months to date. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 1 was experienced while no immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) was found. In addition, CAR copy number peaked at 350, 758 copies/μg on day 6. This case report of clinical treatment of T-ALL with anti-CD7 CAR-T cells prepared using a retroviral vector without gene editing and combined with chemotherapy, which demonstrated that the RV-based anti-CD7 CAR-T cells had good therapeutic effect and high safety in triple-refractory T-ALL patients.",0
"Synbiotics are supplements containing probiotics and prebiotics and potentially have a stronger effect in modulating the gut microbiota than probiotics or prebiotics alone. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of LactoCare synbiotic administration on chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID), nausea, vomiting, and constipation in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who receiving maintenance chemotherapy. This double-blind clinical trial was performed on 113 children with ALL. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either 5 × 10 In the LactoCare-treatment group, CID was present in 3.7% and 1.8% of patients on the first and second days, respectively, and no CID was observed on the third to seventh days (p < .05). While in the placebo group, the rate of patients with CID on the second, third, and fourth days was 11.5%, 13.5%, and 11.5%, respectively, and less than 10% on the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh days. It was observed that the rate of constipation in the LactoCare-treatment group was significantly lower than in the placebo group. The difference between the groups was about 14% on the third day, which increased to about 20% on the sixth day (p < .05). The use of synbiotic supplements in this study reduced CID in patients. This study supports the concept that the use of synbiotic supplements will be an easy and effective way to reduce CID in ALL patients.",0
" The flavonol content of commercial capers (pickled flower buds of Capparis spinosa L., C. sicula Veill. in Duham. and C. orientalis Veill. in Duham.) produced in different Mediterranean countries (Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey and Morocco) has been analysed. The content of quercetin 3-rutinoside, kaempferol 3-rutinoside; and kaempferol 3-rhamnosyl-rutinoside as well as the aglycones (quercetin and kaempferol) were evaluated by HPLC coupled with a diode-array detector. The free aglycones were not detected in the original flower buds, indicating that they were produced during the brining process. In addition, brining extracted most of the kaempferol 3-rhamnosyl rutinoside present in the original buds, this being a minor constituent in pickled capers. The average content of flavonoid glycosides in commercial capers was 5.18 mg/g fresh weight. When this value is converted to the corresponding aglycones (quercetin and kaempferol), capers provide an average of 3.86 mg/g fresh weight. A serving of capers (10 g) will provide 65 mg of flavonoid glycosides or the equivalent 40 mg of quercetin as aglycone.",1
"Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (CircRNAs) have the novel functions and molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of malignant diseases. CircRNAs have been found to be associated with the occurrence and development of lymphoproliferative diseases, impacting on lymphocyte proliferation. This article provides a review of the pathogenesis of circRNAs in malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, focusing on conditions such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and lymphoma. Additionally, it discusses the potential value of circRNAs as novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets in these disorders.",0
"Two types of plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) proliferation disease are acknowledged so far by the 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumors: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) and mature pDC proliferation associated with myeloid neoplasms (MPDCP) in which pDC is part of the malignant clone. We aim to investigate pDC proliferation associated with non-myeloid acute leukemia (AL). A retrospective analysis of all cases admitted in our center with a diagnosis of non-myeloid AL from September 2020 to April 2023 was performed to select cases with pDCs greater than 2% of bone marrow by flow cytometry (FCM). We conducted comprehensive analyses encompassing FCM immunophenotyping, histopathological examination, morphological assessment, cytogenetic studies, and molecular genetic profiling across all cases. Proliferation of pDCs was detected in 10 (0.88%) out of 1140 non-myeloid AL patients by FCM, including 4/944(0.42%) cases of B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 3/95 (3.16%) cases of T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and 3/101 (2.97%) cases of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) (p = 0.009). The 4 cases of B-ALL were all Philadelphia Chromosome positive (Ph+). PDCs in 3 out of 10 patients expressed CD56 (37.5%), 8/10 expressed CD7 (80%), 9/10 expressed CD303 (90%), all expressed CD304 (100%), and 5 of 8 evaluable cases were positive for CD34 (62.5%). In cases in which pDCs expressed CD7 and/or CD56, the blast cells all expressed CD7 and/or CD56 as well; the pDCs in all B-ALL patients expressed CD19. FCM dot plot in 2 of the B-ALL-pDC showed a spectrum from blast cells to pDCs: CD303 and CD304 gradually emerged as CD34 disappeared. Among the 8 patients who underwent bone marrow biopsy, pDCs exhibited two distinct distribution patterns: pure interstitial infiltration in 6 cases (75%) and focal/scattered clusters against an interstitial background in 2 cases (25%). NRAS showed recurrent mutations at identical genomic positions. Each NRAS variant (c.35G>A and c.38G>T) was detected twice across three patients. FCM could effectively detect pDC proliferation in non-myeloid leukemia, which occurred at a significantly higher incidence in T-ALL and ALAL than in B-ALL. In B-ALL, it was associated with the Ph + subtype. PDCs and blast cells shared some lymphoid antigens that were uncommon in AML-pDC or BPDCN. In the bone marrow, pDCs were predominantly characterized by an interstitial infiltration pattern.",0
"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) etiology in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is multifactorial. The use of global assays of hemostasis as a thrombin generation test (TGT) is useful to individualize VTE risk in adult patients. This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of an automated TGT to evaluate VTE risk during ALL treatment in children. TGT (automated analyzer ST Genesia; ThromboScreen) and pro- and anticoagulant plasma proteins were analyzed during ALL treatment in pediatric patients following LAL-SEHOP-PETHEMA-2013 guidelines. Results were compared with a series of pediatric normal controls and evaluated according to pegylated asparaginase PEG-ASP administration and to VTE risk factors. The study included 67 patients: males TGT could be a biomarker of a high VTE risk in ALL pediatric patients. Non-O blood group and inherited thrombophilia were associated with a significantly higher thrombotic profile, and an increased profile was also observed after administration of PEG-ASP.",0
"This work has studied the effects of varying germination conditions for beans, lentils and peas, at semi-pilot scale, on bioactive compounds such as flavonoid and non-flavonoid phenolic compounds. It has also evaluated the free radical scavenging activity of these samples. The legumes studied contain different hydroxybenzoic acids and aldehydes, hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, flavonol glycosides, and flavan-3-ols and procyanidins. The results obtained indicate that germination modifies the quantitative and qualitative phenolic composition of legumes, and the changes depend on the type of legume and the germination conditions. These changes influence the functional properties of the legumes as consequence of the variation in antioxidant activity. Peas and beans undergo a significant increase in antioxidant activity after germination, whereas lentils show a decrease.",1
"Severe intestinal mucositis (IM) increases the risk of bloodstream infections (BSI) and inflammatory toxicity during acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) induction treatment. However, the implications of IM in subsequent ALL therapy phases after achieving remission remain unknown. This study investigated the relationship between IM (measured by plasma citrulline and the chemokine CCL20) and the development of BSI and systemic inflammation (reflected by C-reactive protein, CRP) in children with ALL during high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) treatment, an important part of ALL consolidation therapy. The study compared patients treated according to the NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol (n = 52) and the ALLTogether1 protocol (n = 42), both with identical HDMTX procedures but different scheduling. One week post-HDMTX, citrulline dropped to median levels of 14.5 and 16.9 μM for patients treated according to the NOPHO ALL 2008 and ALLTogether1 protocols, respectively (p = 0.11). In a protocol and neutrophil count-adjusted analysis, hypocitrullinaemia (<10 μmol/L) was associated with increased odds of BSI within 3 weeks from HDMTX (OR = 26.2, p = 0.0074). Patients treated according to the NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol exhibited increased mucosal- and systemic inflammation post-HDMTX compared to patients treated according to ALLTogether1, with increased CCL20 (14.6 vs. 3.7 pg/mL, p < 0.0001) and CRP levels (10.0 vs. 1.0 mg/L, p < 0.0001). Both citrulline and CCL20 correlated with CRP for these patients (r",0
"The impact of different processing technologies, including non-thermal technologies, on bioactive compounds of orange juice was investigated. Freshly squeezed orange juice was treated by high pressure (HP) (400 MPa/40 °C/1 min), pulsed electric fields (PEF) (35 kV cm−1/750 μs) and low pasteurization (LPT) (70 °C/30 s). The stability of main carotenoids and flavanones was studied just after treatment and during 40 days of refrigerated storage at 4 °C. Just after treatment, HP juice showed a significant increase on total carotenoid and flavanone content extracted (45.19 and 15.46%, respectively) and on vitamin A value (30.89%) with regard untreated juice, whereas no significant changes were observed for PEF and LPT juices. For all treated orange juices, flavanone content decreased significantly (around 50%) during the first 20 days of storage at 4 °C while carotenoid content showed a moderate decrease (less than 11%) that took place during the last 20 days. In general, during refrigerated storage, carotenoids and flavanones remained higher in HP juice than in LPT and PEF juices. Hence, HP and PEF technologies were as effective o even more than LPT to preserve bioactive compounds in orange juice during refrigerated storage.",1
"In the present study we investigated the metabolic conversion of cyanidin glycosides in human subjects using solid-phase extraction,HPLC-diode array detector, MS, GC, and enzymic techniques. Volunteers consumed approximately 20 g chokeberry extract containing 1.3 g cyanidin 3-glycosides (899 mg cyanidin 3-galactoside, 321 mg cyanidin 3-arabinoside, 51 mg cyanidin 3-xyloside and 50 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h post-consumption of the extract. Urine samples were also collected at 0, 4-5,and 22-24h. We have confirmed that human subjects have the capacity to metabolise cyanidin 3-glycosides, as we observed at least ten individual anthocyanin metabolites in the urine and serum. Average concentrations of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites in the urine reached levels of 17.9 (range 14.9-20.9) l.mol/l within 5 h post-consumption and persisted in 24h urine samples at levels of 12.1 (range 11.1-13.0) nmol/l. In addition, average total levels of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites detected in the serum were observed at 5917 (range 197.3-986.1) nmol/ within 2h post-consumption. Cyanidin 3-galactoside accounted for 55.4% (9.9(range 7-2-12-6) l.mol/) and 66.0% (390.6 (range 119.4-661-9) nmol V) of the detected anthocyanins in the urine and serum samples,respectively. The metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates, as well as methylated and oxidised derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and cyanidin glucuronide. Conjugation probably affects the biological activity of anthocyanins and these metabolic products are likely in part responsible for the reported health benefits associated with the consumption of anthocyanins.",1
"A 23-year-old man with a history of Ph-Like B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with JAK2 rearrangement presented with innumerable skin lesions developing over 1 week. Before presentation, he had multiple relapses of his B-ALL and underwent autologous UCD-19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. Lesions appeared 1.5 months after completion of therapy. Biopsies showed new onset myeloid sarcoma (MS), with continued remission of B-ALL. 18 F-FDG PET/CT showed numerous markedly hypermetabolic soft tissue lesions located in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, muscles, osseous structures, mucosa, pleura, mediastinum, peritoneum, retroperitoneum, and testes.",0
"Numerous hematologic neoplasms, including acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), are characterized by overexpression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Despite the high clinical efficacy of the specific BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), dose limitation and resistance argue for the early exploration of rational combination strategies. Recent data indicated that BCL-2 inhibition in B-ALL with",0
"Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely. Pinotin A formation proceeds as long as a certain level of malvidin 3-glucoside is maintained in the wines. In wines >5-6 years old degradation or polymerization of pinotin A finally exceeds the rate of its de novo synthesis.",1
"Twenty-one flavonol metabolites have been identified by LC/ESI-MS/MS in human urine, including isomers, after the consumption of cooked onions. Metabolites identified include quercetin monoglucuronides, methyl quercetin monoglucuronides, a quercetin monoglucuronide sulfate, quercetin diglucuronides, a methyl quercetin diglucuronide, quercetin glucoside sulfates, methyl quercetin, quercetin, and kaempferol monoglucuronides. The fragmentation patterns of flavonol metabolites obtained by MS/MS were distinctive for some isomers, indicating that fragmentation patterns may be useful predictors of conjugation position. Two isomers of sulfate quercetin glucosides were also found in urine, suggesting that many of the quercetin glucosides in onion are absorbed intact and undergo metabolism to the sulfate conjugate. Additionally, the interindividual variation in urinary quercetin metabolite profiles was determined by comparing the relative level of six different quercetin metabolites excreted in the urine of healthy volunteers. The ranges of quercetin metabolites excreted were similar among volunteers, yet notable differences in the levels of metabolites among individuals were observed. This study demonstrates the potential of monitoring the range of quercetin metabolites to reveal information on interindividual biotransformation capacity in response to dietary manipulations and as a biomarker for flavonol consumption.",1
"Fungal infections constitute a significant challenge and continue to be a predominant cause of treatment failure in pediatric leukemia cases. Despite the implementation of antifungal prophylaxis, these infections contribute to approximately 20% of cases in children undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The aim of this study is to highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with invasive fungal infections (IFIs). We also present a review of the epidemiology, risk factors, treatment, and a clinical presentation of IFI in patients with ALL. This case report details the clinical course of confirmed",0
"Due to the high demand for novel approaches for leukemia-targeted therapy, this study investigates the impact of DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 on the sensitivity of pre-B ALL cells to the telomerase inhibitor MST-312. The study involved NALM-6 cells treated with MST-312 and NU7441, assessing their viability and metabolic activity using trypan blue and MTT assays. The study also evaluated apoptosis, gene expression changes, and DNA damage using flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and micronucleus assays. The binding energy of MST-312 in the active site of telomerase was calculated using molecular docking. The study's findings revealed a synergistic decline in both cell viability and metabolic activity in NALM-6 cells when exposed to the combined treatment of MST-312 and NU7441, and this decrease occurred without any adverse effects on healthy PBMC cells. Furthermore, the combination treatment exhibited a significantly higher induction of apoptosis than treatment with MST-312 alone, as observed through flow cytometry assay. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that this enhanced apoptosis was associated with a notable downregulation of Bcl-2 expression and an upregulation of Bax gene expression. Moreover, the combination therapy decreased expression levels of hTERT and c-Myc genes. The micronucleus assay indicated that the combination treatment increased DNA damage in NALM-6 cells. Also, a good conformation between MST-312 and the active site of telomerase was revealed by docking data. The study suggests that simultaneous inhibition of telomerase and DNA-PK in pre-B ALL presents a novel targeted therapy approach.",0

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disorder in both humans and animals. L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) has limitations as a chemotherapy agent due to adverse effects and low serum stability. In a previous study, L-ASNase was chemically modified with carboxymethyl dextran to enhance its properties. This study aimed to validate the potential of these modifications using the NALM-6 cell line. NALM-6 cells were cultured and treated with various concentrations, including 0 IU/ml as negative control, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 IU/ml of modified L-ASNase and L-ASNase. The optimal concentration was determined at specific intervals, and viability and metabolic activity were assessed through Trypan blue and MTT tests. Flow cytometry, using Annexin V/PI staining, was employed to evaluate apoptosis. Real-time RT-PCR techniques were used to determine changes in the expression of the The modified L-ASNase reduced the viability of NALM-6 cells and induced higher levels of apoptosis (P=0.001). Interestingly, the modified enzyme had a lesser impact on autophagy, which is important for avoiding treatment resistance. The modified L-ASNase showed enhanced effectiveness in reducing the viability of NALM-6 cells and induced higher levels of apoptosis. Interestingly, the modified enzyme had a lesser effect on autophagy, which is important as excessive autophagy can lead to treatment resistance. These findings suggest that the modified L-ASNase may have the potential to be a more effective chemotherapeutic agent for ALL treatments.",0
"Ellagic acid (EA) and hydrolyzable ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols found in fruits and nuts and implicated with potent antioxidant, anticancer and antiatherosclerotic biological properties. Unfortunately, there are no reports on the bioavailability studies of EA or ETs in the human body.

"Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in biological fluids.",1
"Despite some progress having been made regarding the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the prognosis of T-ALL, particularly adult T-ALL, is still poor. Identifying novel, effective anti-T-ALL drugs is of great significance. Anlotinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently utilized in the treatment of lung cancer, exhibited a promising anti-T-ALL effect. A comprehensive study should therefore be conducted to explore both the in vitro as well as in vivo mechanisms of the anti-T-ALL effects of anlotinib. CCK8 assays and flow cytometry were employed to investigate the viability, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis of T-ALL cell lines when treated with anlotinib. T-ALL xenograft mouse models were established to examine the in vivo antileukemic effects of anlotinib. Cellular and molecular analysis of T-ALL were conducted to define the underlying mechanisms. In vitro, anlotinib significantly inhibited the viability, induced G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in T-ALL cell lines in a concentration-dependent pattern. In vivo, anlotinib also demonstrated a strong anti-tumor effect at doses that are well-tolerated. Interestingly, anlotinib could decrease the protein levels of the intracellular domains of NOTCH1 (ICN1) and c-Myc, two important targets for T-ALL. Mechanistically, anlotinib-induced c-Myc reduction was associated with proteasome-mediated degradation, while the ICN1 reduction was not due to protein degradation or transcriptional repression. The present study showed that anlotinib may be a promising anti-T-ALL candidate drug, and simultaneous reduction of the protein levels of both ICN1 and c-Myc may contribute to the anti-T-ALL efficacy of anlotinib.",0
"The Children's Oncology Group (COG)-AALL0434 trial investigated the addition of nelarabine to the augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (aBFM) protocol in patients (1.0-30.99 years) with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Despite demonstrating superior outcomes, nelarabine is not currently funded by many health systems, in part due to a lack of cost-effectiveness data. We estimated the cost-utility of nelarabine for this indication from a Canadian public healthcare payer perspective. We developed a microsimulation model that followed hypothetical patients with newly diagnosed T-ALL from post-induction therapy to death. Three health states were modeled: relapse-free, post-relapse, and death. Efficacy was estimated using AALL0434 and retrospective data from Ontario, Canada. Costs were obtained from Canadian sources. Utility estimates and long-term mortality risks were sourced from literature. Total healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were reported. Probabilistic and scenario analyses were conducted. Incorporating nelarabine in the aBFM protocol increased costs by $51,670 Canadian dollars per patient, but resulted in 1.97 more QALYs and an ICER of $26,184/QALY. Most of the identified cost and benefit were accrued within the AALL0434 trial period (first 11 years post diagnosis) and while patients were in the relapse-free health state. Across multiple scenarios, the ICER was stable under an assumed $50,000/QALY threshold. Incorporating nelarabine into aBFM was cost-effective across different scenarios and assumptions. These results support its funding by public and private payers.",0
"The influence of genetic ancestry on biology, survival outcomes, and risk stratification in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) has not been explored. Genetic ancestry was genomically-derived from DNA-based single nucleotide polymorphisms in children and young adults with T-ALL treated on Children's Oncology Group trial AALL0434. We determined associations of genetic ancestry, leukemia genomics and survival outcomes; co-primary outcomes were genomic subtype, pathway alteration, overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS). Among 1309 patients, T-ALL molecular subtypes varied significantly by genetic ancestry, including increased frequency of genomically defined ETP-like, MLLT10, and BCL11B-activated subtypes in patients of African ancestry. In multivariable Cox models adjusting for high-risk subtype and pathways, patients of Admixed American ancestry had superior 5-year EFS/OS compared with European; EFS/OS for patients of African and European ancestry were similar. The prognostic value of five commonly altered T-ALL genes varied by ancestry - including",0
"Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.",1
"Eight medicinal plants (marigold (Calendula officinalis), dragonhead (Dracocephalum moldavica), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), plantago (Plantago afra), clary (Salvia verbenaca), sage (Salvia viridis), sideritis (Sideritis montana) and milk thisle (Silybum marianum)) were cultivated in the Experimental Farm Station of the National Research Centre at Shalakan Kalubia Governorate, Egypt, for two consecutive seasons of 2003/04. Plants were grown under organic farming conditions, as the soil was treated with organic compost without using mineral or chemical fertilizers. The herbs of the plants were harvested and subjected to the estimation of phenolic compounds and antioxidative activities in their extracts. The results showed that plant growth parameters varied greatly. Marigold plants were significantly the highest, while sage plants resulted significantly in the heaviest fresh and dry herb weight. Salicylic acid was the highest phenolic compound, compared to the other 14 phenolics. Salicylic was present in high contents in all the studied plants except sage which contained the largest quantity of pyrogallic acid [pyrogallol]. Catechol [pyrocatechol], protocatechuic and cinnamic acids were the phenolics present in the lowest quantity. Different plants greatly varied in the contents of phenolic compounds. Antioxidant activity increased as ethanol extract was raised from 100 to 150 and 200 µl. Sage showed very strong antioxidant capacity (91.34% inhibition of peroxidation at 200 µl extract), followed by dragonhead and plantago. Other plants showed moderate antioxidant activities. Further work on the effect of organic farming compared to the chemical one on phenolics and antioxidant activity as well as on different medicinal plants are suggested.",1
"Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) is a potentially life-threatening complication that can be observed after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Inotuzumab ozogamicin is an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate that has demonstrated high efficacy in relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but is associated with an increased risk of SOS in HCT recipients. Here we aimed to examine the incidence and outcomes of SOS in 47 adult patients with R/R ALL who received inotuzumab therapy and subsequently underwent HCT at our institution. All patients received prophylactic therapy with ursodiol, and continuous low-dose heparin also was administered to patients receiving myeloablative conditioning (MAC). SOS occurred in 12 patients (26%) post-HCT, at a median onset of 11 days (range, 3 to 41 days). SOS was graded as very severe in 50% (n = 6), severe in 25% (n = 3), and mild in 25% (n = 3). All patients diagnosed with SOS received treatment with defibrotide for a median of 21 days (range, 3 to 34 days), with resolution of SOS occurring in 8 patients (67%). Mortality from SOS was 33% (n = 4) and occurred at a median of 10 days from diagnosis (range, 3 to 31 days) in patients graded as very severe (n = 3) or severe (n = 1). There were no significant differences between patients who developed SOS and those who did not develop SOS in the median time from the last dose of inotuzumab to transplantation (46 days versus 53 days; P = .37), use of an MAC regimen (42% versus 49%; P = .75), number of lines of therapy prior to inotuzumab (P = .79), median number of administered cycles of inotuzumab (2 versus 2; P = .14), or receipt of inotuzumab as the last therapy prior to HCT (67% versus 66%; P = 1.0). Sirolimus-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was used more frequently in the SOS group (75% versus 29%; P < .01), but there was no between-group difference in the peak sirolimus level (P = .81) or the median time to peak sirolimus level (7 days versus 3.5 days; P = .39). In univariable analysis, only the use of sirolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis was significantly associated with an increased risk of SOS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 33.6; P < .01). In the SOS group, the 100-day mortality rate was 33% (n = 4), and median overall survival (OS) post-HCT was 4.3 months (range, 0.2 to 57.2 months). In the group without SOS, the 100-day mortality rate was 14% (n = 5) and the median OS post-HCT was 10.7 months (range, .52 to 39.6 months). In this study cohort, SOS was prevalent in HCT recipients who had been treated with inotuzumab prior to transplantation, and sirolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis was a risk factor for SOS in inotuzumab recipients.",0
"Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.",1
"Economic evaluation of one-time therapies during reimbursement decision-making is challenging due to uncertain long-term outcomes. The availability of 5-year outcome data from the ELIANA trial and real-world evidence of tisagenlecleucel, the first chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, presents an opportunity to re-evaluate the predictions of prior cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). To conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of prior CEAs of tisagenlecleucel for pediatric/young adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL) and evaluate the impact of recently available 5-year efficacy data from ELIANA and advances in CAR-T manufacturing in an updated CEA model. OVID MEDLINE/Embase and health technology assessment (HTA) databases were searched for full-text economic evaluations in English reporting cost-effectiveness results for tisagenlecleucel for r/r ALL. Evaluations with publicly reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were included in the SLR. Study screening and data abstraction were conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Data extracted included the country/currency, perspective, clinical trial evidence, model structures, long-term efficacy extrapolation approaches (i.e., overall survival [OS]), time horizon, discount rates, and outcomes (i.e., life years [LY], quality-adjusted LY [QALY], and ICERs). The CEA model reported in Wakase et al. was updated using 5-year OS data from ELIANA and the CAR-T infusion rate informed by real-world practice. Sixteen records corresponding to 15 unique studies were included in the SLR (11 publications and 5 HTA reports); all were conducted from the health care system perspective of the respective countries. Most studies found tisagenlecleucel to be cost effective, but all studies' projected 3- and 5-year OS rates for tisagenlecleucel were lower than the observed 3- and 5-year rates, respectively, derived from 5-year ELIANA data. When applying updated OS projections from the most recent ELIANA data cut and higher infusion rates of 92.5% (per the real-world infusion rate)-96.0% (per the manufacturer success rate) to the CEA of Wakase et al., the associated QALYs for tisagenlecleucel increased from 11.6 to 14.6-15.0, and LYs increased from 13.3 to 17.0-17.5. Accordingly, the ICERs for tisagenlecleucel decreased from ¥2,035,071 to ¥1,787,988-¥1,789,048 versus blinatumomab and from ¥2,644,702 to ¥2,257,837-¥2,275,181 versus clofarabine combination therapy in the updated CEA model. Projections at launch of the likely cost effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel appear to have underestimated its ultimate economic value given more recent trial and real-world data. To balance uncertainty in initial valuation with the need to provide access to novel oncology therapies, payers can consider flexible reimbursement policies alongside ongoing assessments as new data emerge.",0
"The point-of-care, automated manufacturing of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can reduce the waiting window and increase the therapy accessibility to patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) as compared with commercially available drug products (DPs). We conducted a phase 1/2 trial (NCT04787263) on the use of second-generation (4.1BB), CD19-CAR T cells, for the treatment of patients with BCP-ALL with either first relapse and very-high-risk (VHR) characteristics or second/subsequent relapse and rapidly progressing disease. CAR T cells were manufactured with a 12-day process using CliniMACS Prodigy, from a fresh apheresis and infused fresh. Three dose levels were tested in the phase 1: 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0×106 CAR+ T cells/kg. Nineteen patients were enrolled, 13 (68%) in first VHR relapse. The designed dose was always successfully produced. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the phase 1. Grade 1 to 2 cytokine release syndrome was observed in 13 (68%) patients. Grade 1 to 2 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome occurred in 2 patients and resolved spontaneously. All patients achieved bone marrow complete remission (CR) with negative minimal residual disease. Eight patients (42%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) consolidation. Overall, CR was maintained in 13 of 19 patients (68%), 7 of whom having received HSCT. Importantly, all but 1 patient treated with 3.0×106 CAR+ T cells/kg maintained CR. The 3-year event-free survival and overall survival of the whole cohort are 68% and 83%, respectively. Our data suggest that the point-of-care manufacturing of autologous, anti-CD19 CAR T cells can successfully treat patients with BCP-ALL including those with first relapse and VHR characteristics.",0
"A new phenolic acid trimer was detected by coupled liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy in alkali extracts of maize bran. The trimer was purified by preparative silica gel chromatography. The structure of the new compound was elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and corresponded to a 4-O-8', 5'-5"" dehydrotriferulic acid.",1
"Blinatumomab, a bispecific T-cell engager targeting CD3+ and CD19+, promotes T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). While its efficacy is established in relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, its role as preemptive therapy for minimal residual disease (MRD)-positive patients or those experiencing chemotherapy delays remains undefined. Predictors of treatment failure also require further investigation. In this multicenter retrospective study, 105 patients who received blinatumomab were enrolled. Of these, 30 had R/R ALL, 21 were in complete remission (CR) with MRD positivity (CR-MRD The CR rate was 81.8% in R/R and 82.5% in CR-MRD Blinatumomab effectively clears MRD as preemptive therapy and serves as a bridging strategy during chemotherapy delays in pediatric B-ALL, while maintaining high response rates in R/R cases.",0
"A new rapid and sensitive method has been developed, using liquid chromatography in tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) to identify green tea catechin metabolites in plasma and urine after oral intake of a green tea extract. (−)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (−)-epigallocatechin (EGC)-glucuronide, (−)-epicatechin (EC)-glucuronide, and EC-sulfate were identified in plasma, whereas in urine only the conjugated catechins were detected (EGC-glucuronide, EGC-sulfate, EC-glucuronide, and EC-sulfate). Standard calibration curves prepared in plasma were found to be linear in the range of 10.9–1379.3 nmol/L for EGCG, EGC, ECG, and EC. The accuracy and precision of this assay showed a coefficient of variation of <15%. The method allowed the detection and quantification limits (for 20 µL injection) from 1.1 to 2.6 nmol/L and 3.8–8.7 nmol/L, respectively, in plasma and 0.8–1.8 nmol/L and 2.6–6.0 nmol/L, respectively, in urine. This method can be applied for future clinical and epidemiological studies, allowing the identification of the active metabolites that will reach the target tissues.",1
"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a significant complication; however, its impact on relapse remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of CMV reactivation on relapse and survival after HCT in patients with acute leukemia. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1258 patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent their first HCT between 2000 and 2020. Our cohort included 871 patients with AML and 387 patients with ALL. Among all patients, 751 (61.6%) experienced CMV reactivation within one year post-HCT. CMV reactivation was associated with HCT from unrelated donors, anti-thymocyte globulin use, and the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease. Notably, CMV reactivation was associated with a lower risk of relapse (HR, 0.713; P = .001) and improved event-free survival (HR, 0.743; P = .001) in both AML and ALL patients. However, there was no significant difference in non-relapse mortality or overall survival according to CMV reactivation. These results suggest that CMV reactivation may prevent post-HCT relapse and enhance event-free survival in AML and ALL patients. Therefore, a CMV prophylaxis strategy is warranted to establish a safe range of CMV reactivation titers that can yield beneficial effects.",0
"Phenolic composition and susceptibility to browning were determined for nine apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) cultivars. Chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acids, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, and rutin (or quercetin-3-rutinoside) were the major phenolic compounds in apricots. In addition to these compounds, other quercetin-3-glycosides and procyanidins have been detected. Chlorogenic acid content decreased rapidly during enzymatic browning, but the susceptibility to browning seemed to be more strongly correlated with the initial amount of flavan-3-ols (defined as catechin monomers and procyanidins). As chlorogenic acid is certainly the best substrate for polyphenol oxidase, the development of brown pigments depended mainly on the flavan-3-ol content.",1
"The composition of anthocyanin pigments in aromatic red rice (RP) and its wine (WP) was mainly determined by HPLC analysis. The WP was constituted of about seven cyanidin-or peonidin-based anthocyanins as were the pigments of RP. Based on the results of the mixture test with standard pigments, all anthocyanins in WP, except the fifth one eluted, could be identified as cyanidin 3, 5-diglucoside, 3-sophoroside, 3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, and as peonidin 3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside, respectively. The composition ratio of the cyanidin 3-glucoside (major pigment) in WP was lower than that of the corresponding cyanidin 3-glucoside of RP.",1
"Session 2 of the 2021 Society for Hematopathology and European Association for Haematopathology Workshop collected examples of lineage infidelity and transdifferentiation in B-lineage neoplasms, including after targeted therapy. Twenty cases were submitted. Whole-exome sequencing and genome-wide RNA expression analysis were available on a limited subsample. A diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) was rendered on at least 1 biopsy from 13 patients. There was 1 case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); the remaining 6 cases were mature B-cell neoplasms. Targeted therapy was administered in 7 cases of B-ALL and 4 cases of mature B-cell neoplasms. Six cases of B-ALL underwent lineage switch to AML or mixed-phenotype acute leukemia at relapse, 5 of which had rearranged KMT2A. Changes in maturational state without lineage switch were observed in 2 cases. Examples of de novo aberrant T-cell antigen expression (n = 2) were seen among the mature B-cell lymphoma cohort, and their presence correlated with alterations in tumor cell gene expression patterns. This cohort of cases enabled us to illustrate, discuss, and review current concepts of lineage switch and aberrant antigen expression in a variety of B-cell neoplasms and draw attention to the role targeted therapies may have in predisposing neoplasms to transdifferentiation as well as other, less expected changes in maturational status.",0
"The total phenolic content (TPC), total antioxidant status (TAS), free radical scavenging capacity, inhibition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and metal chelating capacity of extracts of whole black and whole white sesame seeds and their hull fractions in 80% aqueous ethanol were investigated. The TPC of whole black sesame seeds and hull extracts were 29.9±0.6 and 146.6±0.6mgcatechinequivalents/g crude ethanolic extract, respectively. The corresponding values for white sesame were 10.6±1.6 and 29.7±0.9mgcatechinequivalents/g crude ethanolic extract. The TAS as determined by Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay and expressed as Trolox equivalents was highest for black sesame hulls (65.9±1.7) while white seeds showed the lowest (4.4±0.6). Free radical scavenging capacity of sesame extracts (5–40μg/mL) was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical. The highest scavenging capacity was obtained at 40μg/mL and was 94.9±0.8, 25.1±0.4, 14.4±0.9 and 2.5±0.4 for black sesame hulls, black sesame seeds, white sesame hulls and white sesame seeds, respectively. Inhibition of LDL oxidation at 100ppm level was highest for black sesame hulls (96.7%) followed by those for white sesame hulls (84.6%), black sesame (78.4%) and white sesame seeds (57.3%). Sesame products displayed good ferrous ion chelating capacities, which ranged from 12% to 46% and 17% to 62% at 50 and 100ppm levels, respectively. Results demonstrated considerable antioxidant activity of sesame products tested especially black sesame hulls.",1
"Unprocessed olives are well-known sources of phenolic antioxidants with important biological properties. Processing methods to prepare table olives may cause a reduction of valuable phenols and may deprive the food of precious biological functions. The present work was undertaken to evaluate table olives produced in Greece as sources of biophenols. Commercially available olives were analyzed for their total phenol content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and for individual phenols by RP-HPLC. Samples were Spanish-style green olives in brine, Greek-style naturally black olives in brine, and Kalamata olives in brine. Most of the types of olives analyzed were found to be good sources of phenols. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and luteolin were the prevailing phenols in almost all of the samples examined. High levels of hydroxytyrosol were determined mainly in Kalamata olives and Spanish-style green olives, cultivar Chalkidiki (250-760 mg/kg).",1
"Significant heterogeneity has been reported in outcome of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(1;19)(q23;p13)/TCF3::PBX1 in adolescents and adults leading to a lack of consensus on precise risk stratification. We evaluated clinical outcome of 17 adult ALL cases (≥15 years) with this genotype treated on intensive regimes.13/17 received COG0232 and 4/17 cases received UK-ALL protocol. All achieved CR (100%) with above treatment. End of induction MRD was evaluated in 14/17 cases of which 11 (78.5%) achieved MRD negativity. Total nine patients relapsed (7 marrows, 2 CNS). Overall survival at 2 years was 53.3%. The 2 year estimated PFS was 42.9%. The 2 years CIR was 54.2%. Adults with this genotype perform poorly despite early favorable response. Incorporation of novel immunotherapies and prompt HSCT should be strongly considered with this genotype. Targeted NGS panels for additional genetic aberrations can further help in risk stratifying and guiding therapy for this genotype.",0
"B/T mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is a rare aggressive leukemia. Three cases of B/T MPAL were identified with comprehensive immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular studies. T-lineage predominant B/T MPAL shares a genetic signature with T-ALL whereas B/T lineage co-dominant B/T MPAL lacks such a T-ALL signature",0
"Significant improvements have occurred for adolescent and young adult (AYA) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients following the widespread adoption of ""pediatric-inspired"" treatment regimens for AYA patients cared for in adult oncology settings. However, for AYA patients, aged 15 to 39, an outcomes gap remains in B-ALL, necessitating the incorporation of novel therapies into up-front treatment regimens. As a result, clinical trial enrollment remains the current standard of care for AYA B-ALL across disease subtypes when available and accessible. Currently, several up-front trials are looking to incorporate the use of inotuzumab, blinatumomab, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy into existing chemotherapy backbones for AYA patients, as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for both Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) and Ph-like B-ALL. In addition to ongoing attempts to improve up-front treatments by incorporating immunotherapy and targeted approaches, the increased use of next generation sequencing for measurable residual disease evaluation has led to superior risk-stratification and a decreased need to pursue consolidative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during the first complete remission for many patients.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the predominant malignancy in pediatric patients, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) plays a critical role in high-risk cases. However, real-world nationwide data comparing the outcomes of conditioning regimens are limited. This nationwide registry-based study analyzed data from 270 Korean pediatric patients with high-risk or relapsed ALL who underwent their first allogeneic HSCT with myeloablative conditioning. Among all analyzed patients, 118 received total body irradiation-based conditioning (MAC-TBI) and 152 received chemotherapy-based conditioning (MAC-Chemotherapy), of whom 96.6% underwent busulfan-based regimens. MAC-TBI recipients were older at diagnosis and at HSCT. No significant differences were observed between groups in neutrophil or platelet engraftment times, or infused CD34+ cell doses. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidences (grades II-IV and III-IV) were comparable, although chronic GVHD incidence tended to be lower in the MAC-Chemotherapy group (21.0% vs. 31.1%, P = 0.072). Additionally, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates for MAC-TBI versus MAC-Chemotherapy were 73.7% and 69.8% (P = 0.827), respectively; the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 76.3% and 80.2% (P = 0.941), respectively, indicating that conditioning regimen did not significantly impact survival. Pediatric disease risk index, recent HSCT era, haploidentical donor type, and pre-transplant disease status independently influenced EFS and OS, whereas anti-thymocyte globulin administration significantly improved moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD, leukemia-free survival. This nationwide real-world analysis demonstrated comparable outcomes between myeloablative TBI-based and chemotherapy-based conditioning regimens in pediatric patients with ALL. These findings may inform the development of improved treatment strategies for this patient population.",0
"High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is a potent chemotherapeutic agent used to treat pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). HD-MTX is known for cause delayed elimination and drug-related adverse events. Therefore, close monitoring of delayed MTX elimination in ALL patients is essential. This study aimed to identify the risk factors associated with delayed MTX elimination and to develop a predictive tool for its occurrence. Patients who received MTX chemotherapy during hospitalization were selected for inclusion in our study. Univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods were used to screen for relevant features. Then four machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to construct prediction model in different sampling method. Furthermore, the performance of the model was evaluated using several indicators. Finally, the optimal model was deployed on a web page to create a visual prediction tool. The study included 329 patients with delayed MTX elimination and 1400 patients without delayed MTX elimination who met the inclusion criteria. Univariate and LASSO regression analysis identified eleven predictors, including age, weight, creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, albumin, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, prothrombin time, immunological classification, and co-medication with omeprazole. The XGBoost algorithm with SMOTE exhibited AUROC of 0.897, AUPR of 0.729, sensitivity of 0.808, specificity of 0.847, outperforming the other models. And had AUROC of 0.788 in external validation. The XGBoost algorithm provides superior performance in predicting the delayed elimination of MTX. We have created a prediction tool to assist medical professionals in predicting MTX metabolic delay.",0
"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) constitutes a rare and aggressive malignancy originating from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with a primarily cutaneous tropism followed by dissemination to the bone marrow and other organs. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of the tumor methylome in an extended cohort of 45 BPDCN patients supplemented by WES and RNA-seq as well as ATAC-seq on selected cases. We determined the BPDCN DNA methylation profile and observed a dramatic loss of DNA methylation during malignant transformation from early and mature DCs towards BPDCN. DNA methylation profiles further differentiate between BPDCN, AML, CMML, and T-ALL exhibiting the most striking global demethylation, mitotic stress, and merely localized DNA hypermethylation in BPDCN resulting in pronounced inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by comparison. DNA methylation-based analysis of the tumor microenvironment by MethylCIBERSORT yielded two, prognostically relevant clusters (IC1 and IC2) with specific cellular composition and mutational spectra. Further, the transcriptional subgroups of BPDCN (C1 and C2) differ by DNA methylation signatures in interleukin/inflammatory signaling genes but also by higher transcription factor activity of JAK-STAT and NFkB signaling in C2 in contrast to an EZH2 dependence in C1-BPDCN. Our integrative characterization of BPDCN offers novel molecular insights and potential diagnostic applications.",0
"Philadelphia chromosome-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-like ALL) is a high-risk subtype with a poor prognosis under conventional chemotherapy. Ph-like ALL has a similar gene expression profile to Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL, but is highly heterogeneous in terms of genomic alterations. Approximately 10-20% of patients with Ph-like ALL harbor ABL class (e.g. ABL1, ABL2, PDGFRB, and CSF1R) rearrangements. Additional genes that form fusion genes with ABL class genes are still being researched. These aberrations result from rearrangements including chromosome translocations or deletions and may be targets of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, due to the heterogeneity and rarity of each fusion gene in clinical practice, there is limited data on the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we report three cases of Ph-like B-ALL with ABL1 rearrangements treated with the dasatinib backbone for the CNTRL::ABL1, LSM14A::ABL1, and FOXP1::ABL1 fusion genes. All three patients achieved rapid and profound remission with no significant adverse events. Our findings suggest that dasatinib is a potent TKI for the treatment of ABL1-rearranged Ph-like ALL and can be used as a first-line treatment option for such patients.",0
"The polyphenolic and antioxidant content of white, Mexican blue, and American blue corns processed into nixtamal (cooked kernels), tortillas, and chips was investigated. A post-nixtamalization acidification treatment was assessed as a means to reduce polyphenolic and antioxidant losses. Similar anthocyanin composition (cyanidin 3-monoglycosides) and concentration (314mg/kg) was observed for both blue corn genotypes as was their non-anthocyanin polyphenolic composition ((+)-catechin, free and esterified ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid derivatives). Six derivatives of ferulic acid (88.8–816mg/kg) along with the free form (2480mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (6.6mg/kg), two protocatechuic acid derivatives (4.2 and 14.2mg/kg), and gallic acid (3.9mg/kg) were identified in the white genotype. Both blue genotypes contained higher antioxidant capacity (>8.3μmol Trolox equivalents/g) yet lower polyphenolic levels (3.6–4.4g/kg) than the white genotype. Comparable anthocyanin losses were observed when the blue genotypes were processed into nixtamals (37%), tortillas (54%), and chips (78%) that correlated to polyphenolic (r=0.91) and antioxidant capacity (r=0.94) losses. Acidification was mainly effective in reducing anthocyanin (9–17%), polyphenolic (10%), and antioxidant capacity (6–14%) losses for the blue genotypes. This study compared polyphenolic and antioxidant content among corn genotypes and confirmed that acidification post-nixtamalization could reduce polyphenolic and antioxidant losses.",1
"Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 +/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.",1
"IKZF1 (IKAROS family Zinc Finger 1) alteration is an essential regulator of both T- and B-cell lineage specification with leukemogenic potential. IKZF1 deletion have been described in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with varying prevalence often influenced by underlying cytogenetics and also shown to have diverse prognostic significance. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and prognostic significance of IKZF1 deletion among childhood ALL. Electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS were searched and 32 studies found eligible. Estimated prevalence of IKZF1 deletion among BCR::ABL1 negative and BCR::ABL1 positive ALL patients was 14% (95%CI:13-16%, I",0
"Samples of wheat, rye, and triticale, grown under the same agronomic and climatic conditions during four consecutive years, were analyzed for alkylresorcinol content. Rye contained the highest amounts and wheat the lowest of these compounds. Spring triticales showed intermediate values. Milling these grains into bran, shorts, and flour fractions and subsequent analysis showed the bran to Cereal Chem. 54(3): 475-483 contain the highest level of alkylresorcinols. Intermediate values were found in the shorts, while the flour fractions produced relatively low values. Baking of whole grain meals into breads resulted in losses of alkylresorcinols in the crust and crumb portions of the loaves. The losses were not attributed to heat destruction but were thought to have occurred as the result of fermentation. A group of compounds thought to inhibit growth in several animal species has been isolated from cereal grains (1,2). Identification of these compounds led to a series of resorcinol derivatives with hydrocarbon chains (15 to 25 carbons) at the fifth position (1). Levels of these compounds were shown to vary among cereal grains, rye being consistently higher than wheat (1,3). Selection of cultivar progeny was effective in increasing or decreasing alkylresorcinol content (2). Thus far, these compounds have only been mentioned as being detrimental factors in animal nutrition, although concern has been occasionally raised about possible ill-effects on humans (especially young children) in countries of Europе with high rye bread consumption (4). There are no established human toxicity levels for these compounds. The effect of the baking process on alkylresorcinols is unknown. Triticale, a cross between wheat and rye, has found increased use in the U.S., not only as an animal feed (5,6), but also in the production of many food products (7-9). It is conceivable that the higher alkylresorcinol content in rye compared to that of wheat (2) has been inherited by triticale. It was the purpose of this study: a) to compare the alkylresorcinol contents of wheat, rye, and triticale grown under the same agronomic and elimatic conditions; b) to determine the variability due to crop year and stage of kernel development; c) to study the distribution of these compounds in various milling fractions; and d) to investigate the effect of baking on the retention of alkylresorcinols.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents approximately 1-quarter of all new cases of childhood cancer. Although overall survival following diagnosis has improved in recent years, the toxicity of chemotherapy remains a concern. We describe an 11-year-old male patient diagnosed with T-cell precursor ALL who developed compounded complications during the induction phase of chemotherapy. Patient was hospitalized in the Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantology of the Medical University of Lublin, Poland. The patient's induction therapy was started according to the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017 protocol IAp (International Collaborative Treatment Protocol for Children and Adolescents with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia). Patient developed compounded complications such as cholecystitis, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis and myelosuppression. The patient was treated with leukapheresis, received a broad-spectrum antibiotic, potassium supplementation and hepatoprotective treatment and laparotomy cholecystectomy. In the available literature, there is a limited amount of similar clinical cases with multiple complications in pediatric patients with ALL. Toxicities cause delays in the treatment of the underlying disease. In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, there are side effects during the treatment such as cholecystitis and pancreatitis. Complications during treatment require a quick response and modification of disease management. Abdominal ultrasound performed before treatment makes it possible to observe the dynamics of lesions. Genetic mutation analysis could allow us to more precisely respond to the possible susceptibility to and appearance of complications after the use of a given chemotherapeutic agent.",0
"trans-Resveratrol and trans-piceid were found for the first time in dark chocolate (at least 0.4ppm trans-resveratrol and 1 ppm trans-piceid) and cocoa liquor (at least 0.5ppm trans-resveratrol and 1.2ppm trans-piceid). Because these compounds are highly sensitive to light, a specific extraction procedure was required to recover them, involving delipidation with toluene and cyclohexane and ethanol/water (80/20, v/v) solid–liquid extraction at 60°C before reverse-phase HPLC-MS/MS analysis (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization [APCI] in the positive mode). Thanks to an exceptionally high procyanidin content, chocolate products displayed higher antioxidant activity than much more concentrated commercial stilbene extracts.",1
"There is increasing interest in olive phenolic compounds because of their biological properties as well as their contribution to the colour, taste and shelf life of olive products. Phenolic compounds in natural black Spanish olives are characterised by HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS. Hydroxytyrosol-4-β-D-glucoside has been identified as the major phenolic compound in natural black olives. A qualitative and quantitative study of phenolic substances such as hydroxytyrosol, salidroside, tyrosol, verbascoside, luteolin-7-glucoside, rutin, demethyloleuropein and oleuropein has been carried out. Traces of other phenolic compounds such as catechol, vanillic acid, apigenin-7-rutinoside and ligustroside have also been found by mass spectroscopy. Secoiridoid aglycons, the main phenolic compounds in olive oil, were not detected in olive flesh except the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (HyEDA), particularly in the Arbequina olive variety and only traces were detected in other varieties. Among anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside were the only anthocyanin compounds detected in all the varieties studied. The UV and MS spectra of several unknown phenolic compounds have also been described.",1
"Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.",1
"Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 (coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs for high quality sesame.",1
"Variations in pharmacokinetic responses to high-dose methotrexate are essential for the prognosis and management of toxicity in the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate genetic polymorphisms that are significantly associated with the pharmacokinetic parameters of methotrexate during the consolidation phase of pediatric ALL treatment. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature from 2013 to 2023. The databases used were PubMed and Scopus. The outcomes of interest are the study design, patient characteristics, sample size, chemotherapy protocol utilized, pharmacokinetic parameters identified, and genetic polymorphisms implicated. We included 31 articles in the qualitative synthesis and found that the SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2, and MTHFR genes appear to play significant roles in MTX metabolism and clearance. Among these, variations in SLCO1B1 have the most significant and consistent impact on methotrexate clearance. These implicated variants may contribute to the precision and tailoring of HD-MTX treatment in pediatric ALL patients.",0
"Raw and cooked (boiled and grilled) Poblano, Bell, Chilaca, Caribe, Jalapeño, Serrano, Habanero, and Manzano peppers were evaluated for tristimulus colour, capsaicinoids (capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapscapsaicin), and total phenolic contents. Boiling (96°C) and grilling (210°C) was performed under household conditions according to typical procedures of the Mexican cuisine. Contents of capsaicin (0.6–913.8μg/g), dihydrocapsaicin (0–756.9μg/g), nordihydrocapsaicin (0–68.2μg/g), and total phenolics (1150.5–2190.0μg of gallic acid equivalents/g) in raw peppers varied widely between types of peppers. Moderate losses (1.1–28.1%) in capsaicinoids were induced by boiling while grilling caused a significant increase (2.6–924.9%) in the content of these compounds. Proportion of individual capsaicinoids was similar in raw and cooked peppers. Boiling and grilling sequentially increased (7.4–137.0%) the total phenolic content in pungent peppers. Total phenolic content in non-pungent Bell peppers was reduced by cooking (1.6–26.9%). Boiling induced smaller changes in colour values (L*, a*, and b*) compared to grilling. The results demonstrated that Mexican raw peppers are rich in capsaicinoids and phenolic compounds. Household cooking can cause either decreases or increases in the content of such compounds in peppers.",1
"The caregivers of children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) are believed to experience post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression and anxiety. This present study endeavoured to explore the prevalence and predictors of PTSS, depression, and anxiety among the caregivers of children with ALL. Purposive sampling was used to select the 73 caregivers of children with ALL who participated in this cross-sectional study. The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were used to measure psychological distress. There was a low prevalence (11%) of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among the participants. Although all the criteria for PTSD were not met, a few post-traumatic symptoms remained, suggesting that PTSS was likely present. Most of the participants reported minimal symptoms of depression (79.5%) and anxiety (65.8%). Anxiety, depression, and ethnicity predicted the PTSS scores (R2 = .77, p =.000). Subsequently, depression predicted the PTSS scores (R2 = 0.42, p =0.000). Participants of 'Other' or 'Indigenous' ethnicity had lower PTSS scores and higher anxiety scores (R2 = 0.75, p =0.000) than participants of Malay ethnicity. The caregivers of children with ALL experience post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, and anxiety. These variables co-exist and may have different trajectories in different ethnic groups. Therefore, healthcare providers should take ethnicity and psychological distress into consideration when providing paediatric oncology treatment and care.",0
"Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.",1
"Andersson-like lesions (ALL) in diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) are rare and often underrecognized entities that can mimic infective spondylodiscitis or inflammatory lesions such as Andersson lesion (AL) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Timely differentiation is crucial to avoid misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. We report a 57-year-old diabetic male presenting with progressive cervical myelopathy and radiological findings suggestive of a discovertebral lesion at C6-C7 in the setting of DISH. Despite initial suspicion of infection, negative inflammatory markers and sterile intraoperative cultures, along with imaging and intraoperative findings, supported a diagnosis of ALL. The patient underwent staged surgical management with posterior decompression and fusion followed by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, resulting in significant neurological and functional improvement. This case highlights the importance of recognizing ALL in DISH as a mechanical, non-infective lesion that can lead to spinal instability and neurological compromise. Differentiation from infectious or inflammatory pathologies is essential to guide timely surgical intervention and avoid adverse outcomes.",0
"Flavonols were characterized and measured in experimental (n= 46) and commercial (n= 9) red raspberry juices by HPLC/diode array spectral techniques. Samples were prepared using minicolumns, packed with Polyamide 6. A fraction eluted with methanol contained eight or fewer quercetin glycosides, quercetin, and kaempferol. A second fraction eluted subsequently with 0.5% ammonia in methanol contained three flavonol glucuronides, two flavonol forms, aglycons, ellagic acid, and its derivatives. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the major flavonol in experimental and commercial juices, respectively (mean of 54 and 51 ppm), and a flavonol presumed to be quercetin 3-sophoroside was the second primary compound (means of 29 and 33 ppm). In addition, 36 flavonol forms were measured in trace amounts. The mean total concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol forms, respectively, in experimental juices (n= 45) were 118 and 3.6 ppm and in commercial juices (n= 7) 121 and 3.4 ppm, respectively. The mean total flavonolconcentrations in experimental and commercial juices were 122 and 125 ppm, respectively. Influences of cultivar (n= 10), processing method (standard, high-speed centrifugation, depectinization, diffusion extraction, vacuum and osmotic concentration) and environmental factors (geographic origin, maturity, harvesting method, mold contamination) were evaluated.",1
"Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment. This study demonstrated that anthocyanins were glucuro- and sulfo-conjugated in humans and that the main metabolite of strawberry anthocyanins in human urine was a monoglucuronide of pelargonidin.",1
"Leukemia is driven by metabolic reprogramming, yet the specific causal roles of plasma metabolites in distinct leukemia subtypes remain unclear. This study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore potential causal links between 690 plasma metabolites (and 143 metabolite ratios) and four leukemia subtypes: ALL, AML, CLL, and CML. Genetic variants from genome-wide association studies served as instrumental variables. Multiple MR approaches, including IVW, MR-Egger, and Weighted Median, along with sensitivity analyses, were applied to ensure robust results. Our findings revealed subtype-specific metabolite associations. In ALL, metabolites such as 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate and γ-Glutamylglutamate showed positive associations, while Phosphocholine and Ceramide showed negative associations. AML was positively linked to GlcNAc/GalNAc and negatively to 1-Methylnicotinamide. CLL showed positive associations with Butyrate/Isobutyrate and Androstenediol Monosulfate, and negative ones with Docosatrienoate and α-Tocopherol to Sulfate ratio. CML exhibited negative associations with Cysteine-Glutathione disulfide and Piperine. Our MR study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the metabolomic landscape of leukemia, identifying subtype-specific causal associations involving pathways such as energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid signaling, and redox homeostasis. These findings offer insights into potential plasma biomarkers and therapeutic targets, revealing distinct metabolic vulnerabilities that warrant further investigation for precision treatment strategies across leukemia subtypes. Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, and it can involve changes in how the body’s cells use energy and nutrients. In this study, we looked at how different chemicals in the blood, called metabolites, might be linked to various types of leukemia. By using a method called Mendelian randomization, we analyzed genetic data to explore if certain metabolites play a direct role in causing leukemia.We found that each type of leukemia, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is associated with unique changes in metabolism. For example, ALL showed links to altered energy use and redox balance (important for controlling cell damage), while AML was connected to changes in sugar metabolism. CLL and CML had associations with lipid metabolism and oxidative stress, which can affect how cells grow and survive.These findings are important because they suggest potential new biomarkers (measurable signs) in the blood that could help doctors diagnose leukemia more accurately or develop targeted treatments. Understanding the specific metabolic changes in each type of leukemia may also open up new approaches to personalized medicine, where treatments are tailored to the metabolic needs of each patient’s leukemia subtype.",0
"A method, based on HPLC, described in our previous publication for the analysis of chlorogenic acids in instant coffee, was used in a study of the effect of roasting on the chlorogenic acid composition of Arabica and Robusta coffee. The degradation of seven chlorogenic acids was followed during roasting. Losses of about 60% were observed when mild roasting conditions were used and almost 100% after severe roasting. Considerable differences in degradation rates of individual isomers were observed so that the composition of chlorogenic acids changed throughout the roasting process. Thus the degree of roasting may have a direct influence on the final product flavour as the individual isomers have different sensory properties.",1
"Cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) is expressed on B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases. However, the effect of CD40 activation on B-ALL cells has never been tested in vivo. The aim of our preclinical study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of a CD40 agonist in the treatment of B-ALL using patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Intravenous administration of the CD40 agonist significantly impeded B-ALL cell proliferation and growth in vivo, accompanied by rapid activation of the ERK pathway, which led to the induction of apoptosis and disruption of cell-cycle progression. Cotreatment with a specific inhibitor of ERK further demonstrated that CD40 stimulation induced the proapoptosis of B-ALL cells in an ERK-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis revealed alterations in key signaling pathways associated with B-ALL expansion and maintenance. Moreover, the CD40 agonist markedly reduced the frequency of leukemia-initiating cells and leukemia development in patient-derived xenograft mice. Our study showed that the CD40 agonist can be associated with chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristine and dexamethasone, and this combination showed improved effectiveness. Additionally, the CD40 agonist was more effective on pre-B-ALL (EGIL B-III) that expressed CD40 than on common B-ALL (EGIL B-II) that lacked CD40 expression. These findings suggest that CD40 agonists are promising immunotherapeutic candidates for pediatric B-ALL, warranting further clinical investigations to improve patient outcomes in CD40-expressing B-ALL.",0
"Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.",1
"Population data have shown that the prognosis for elderly patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is poor, even in the modern era and despite improvements in the outcome for younger patients. In this Norwegian prospective population-based study, the feasibility and effectiveness of a paediatric-based regimen in newly diagnosed patients above 65 years of age with ALL were assessed. Patients who were Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative were assigned to unmodified doses of pegylated asparaginase starting on day 30, while Ph-positive patients were treated with imatinib. For frail patients, dose reductions were allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. A total of 52 patients were enrolled, 32 of whom were Ph negative. The median age was 70 years (range 65-82). Forty-nine attained remission, of which four did not receive further treatment and died. Six patients died while in remission and three died from a second malignancy. Among the remaining 36 patients, only six relapsed. The 2-year and 5-year overall survival rates, with a median follow-up of 3.2 years (Interquartile range 1.3-6.3), were 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.46-0.74) and 0.50 (0.34-0.66) respectively. In conclusion, this paediatric-based protocol was well tolerated and effective, with low relapse rates and 50% long-term survival.",0
"To evaluate the treatment cost and cost effectiveness of a risk-stratified therapy to treat pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in India. The cost of total treatment duration was calculated for a retrospective cohort of ALL children treated at a tertiary care facility. Children were risk stratified into standard (SR), intermediate (IR) and high (HR) for B-cell precursor ALL, and T-ALL. Cost of therapy was obtained from the hospital electronic billing systems and details of outpatient (OP) and inpatient (IP) from electronic medical records. Cost effectiveness was calculated in disability-adjusted life years. One hundred and forty five patients, SR (50), IR (36), HR (39), and T-ALL (20) were analyzed. Median cost of the entire treatment for SR, IR, HR, and T-ALL was found to be $3900, $5500, $7400, and $8700, respectively, with chemotherapy contributing to 25%-35% of total cost. Out-patient costs were significantly lower for SR (p < 0.0001). OP costs were higher than in-patient costs for SR and IR, while in-patient costs were higher in T-ALL. Costs for non-therapy admissions were significantly higher in HR and T-ALL (p < 0.0001), representing over 50% of costs of in-patient therapy. HR and T-ALL also had longer durations of non-therapy admissions. Based on WHO-CHOICE guidelines, the risk-stratified approach was very cost effective for all categories of patients. Risk-stratified approach to treat childhood ALL is very cost-effective for all categories in our setting. The cost for SR and IR patients is significantly reduced through decreased IP admissions for both, chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy reasons.",0
"The bioavailability and urinary excretion of three dietary flavonoids, quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin, were investigated. Ten healthy men were asked to consume a 'juice mix' containing equal amounts of the three flavonoids, and their urine and plasma samples were collected. The resulting mean plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-48 h) and C(max) values for quercetin and hesperetin were similar, whereas the AUC(0-48 h) of naringenin and, thus, the relative bioavailability were higher after consumption of the same dose. The study consolidates a significantly lower urinary excretion of quercetin (1.5+/-1%) compared with hesperetin (14.2+/-9.1%) and naringenin (22.6+/-11.5%) and shows that this is not due to a lower bioavailability of quercetin, but rather reflects different clearance mechanisms.",1
"Leukemia niche impacts quiescence; however, culturing patient-derived samples ex vivo is technically challenging. Here, we present a protocol for in vitro co-culture of patient-derived xenograft acute lymphoblastic leukemia (PDX-ALL) cells with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We describe steps for labeling PDX-ALL cells with CellTrace Violet dye to demonstrate MSC-primed PDX-ALL cycling. We then detail procedures to identify MSC-primed G0/quiescent PDX-ALL cells via Hoechst-33342/Pyronin Y live cell cycle analysis.

"The main objective of this research was to determine the extent to which irrigation practices affect the partitioning of phenolic compounds between olive paste, pomace, olive oil and wastewater. The current paper also aimed to study the effect of technological natural micro-talc (NMT) addition during the oil extraction process on the partitioning of the phenolic compounds between solid and liquid phases. The results obtained in this study showed that irrigation applied to olive trees let to a considerable decrease in the phenol content of the olive paste. The water status of the trees affected the phenol synthesis in the olive fruit, and consequently the phenol content of the olive paste, more than the partitioning of the phenolic compounds during the olive oil extraction process. The most remarkable point of the phenol partitioning was related to the simple phenols. While in the samples from non-irrigated trees the greater proportion of these phenols partitioned into the pomace, in samples from irrigated trees most of them were lost in the wastewater. After comparison of the results obtained from the experiments with and without NMT addition, it was concluded that the use of that co-adjuvant did not significantly alter either the phenolic profile of the oil phase obtained or the content of the individual phenolic compounds.",1
"A new HPLC stationary phase has been applied to the analysis of phenolic acids and flavonoids with diode array and mass spectrometric detection. The separation of 26 standard compounds was achieved within 1 h. The stationary phase displayed excellent resolution especially of flavonol glycosides. The analytical system has been used for the determination of phenolic compounds in apple pomace and apple juice, and in extracts of pear fruits of different cultivars. Apple pomace was found to be a promising source of phenolics. However, yields are affected by the drying conditions applied. Furthermore, the applicability of the analytical system for the authenticity control of apple and pear juice was demonstrated by determination of characteristic quercetin and isorhamnetin glycosides, and dihydrochalcones, respectively. Since isorhamnetin-3-glucoside was present in all pear cultivars investigated, the usefulness of arbutin as a specific marker of pear products appears to be doubtful.",1
"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent malignancy particularly among children. It poses diagnostic challenges due to its morphological similarities with normal cells and the limitations of conventional methods like bone marrow biopsies, which are invasive and resource-intensive. This study introduces Causal-Former-HMC, a novel hybrid AI architecture integrating convolutional neural networks, vision transformers, and a causal graph learner with counterfactual reasoning to enhance diagnostic precision and interpretability from peripheral blood smear (PBS) images. We utilized two robust datasets: the ALL Image collection, comprising 89 patients and 3,256 PBS images (504 benign, 2,752 malignant across Pro B, Pre B, and Early Pre B subtypes), and C-NMC dataset, containing 15,135 segmented cell images from 118 patients (7,272 leukemic, 3,389 normal). To address class imbalance, we implemented class-aware data augmentation, standardizing image counts across classes and resizing to 128 × 128 pixels for compatibility with our model. The proposed model is evaluated via stratified 5-fold cross-validation with Nadam, SGD, and Radam (fractional) optimizers, Causal-Former-HMC achieved perfect classification accuracy (100%) and macro-averaged F1-scores on the ALL dataset, and up to 98.5% accuracy with 0.9975 ROC-AUC on the C-NMC dataset hence demonstrating superior generalization. Interpretability was ensured through advanced explainable AI techniques, including Grad-CAM, LIME, Integrated Gradients, and SHAP, which consistently highlighted attention to clinically relevant features such as nuclear contour irregularities and chromatin condensation. These results underscore the potential of the model to deliver non-invasive, accurate and transparent diagnostics that pave the way for its integration into clinical hematology workflows and advancing AI-driven leukemia screening paradigms.

"B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL) is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually involves lymph nodes, skin and soft tissue. Bone marrow and peripheral blood are normally spared from involvement in the disease. B-LBL typically forms solid masses that have similar pathologic and immunophenotypic features to their liquid counterpart, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The presentation of B-LBL with a solitary epidural mass at the cervical spine is very rare and the optimal treatment of such cases is unknown. Most of the literature on the management of B-LBL comes from small case series, pediatric patients, or as part of retrospective data that combine B-LBL with B-ALL cases. The case presented herein is a unique presentation that was treated using three modalities, namely surgical resection, radiotherapy and consolidation with systemic chemotherapy, adopted from the United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukemia (UKALL14) protocol. The patient attained complete remission following the planned treatment and is still in remission for more than four and half years from the time of his initial diagnosis.",0
"Several recent reports have been published indicating that the antioxidant activity of olive oil and tea leaves is not stable over product shelf lives of about one year. We have measured the antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, flavan-3-ols monomers, and procyanidin levels in milk and dark chocolate, in cocoa powder, and in cocoa beans. Results show that for the cocoa products studied, antioxidant activity, and flavan-3-ol levels are stable over typical shelf lives of one year under controlled storage and over 2 years in ambient storage in the laboratory. We also show that 80 year old cocoa powder and 116 year old cocoa beans still show very high levels of antioxidant activity and flavan-3-ol content.",1
"Pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a disease of abnormally growing B lymphoblasts. Here we hypothesized that extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are nanosized particles released by all cells (including cancer cells), could be used to monitor B-ALL severity and progression by sampling plasma instead of bone marrow. EVs are especially attractive as they are present throughout the circulation regardless of the location of the originating cell. First, we used nanoparticle tracking analysis to compare EVs between non-cancer donor (NCD) and B-ALL blood plasma; we found that B-ALL plasma contains more EVs than NCD plasma. We then isolated EVs from NCD and pediatric B-ALL peripheral blood plasma using a synthetic peptide-based isolation technique (Vn96), which is clinically amenable and isolates a broad spectrum of EVs. RNA-seq analysis of small RNAs contained within the isolated EVs revealed a signature of differentially packaged and exclusively packaged RNAs that distinguish NCD from B-ALL. The plasma EVs contain a heterogenous mixture of miRNAs and fragments of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA). Transcripts packaged in B-ALL EVs include those involved in negative cell cycle regulation, potentially suggesting that B-ALL cells may use EVs to discard gene sequences that control growth. In contrast, NCD EVs carry sequences representative of multiple organs, including brain, muscle, and epithelial cells. This signature could potentially be used to monitor B-ALL disease burden in pediatric B-ALL patients",0

"Oleuropein (OE) is the cardinal bioactive compound derived from Olea europaea and possesses numerous beneficial properties for human health. However, despite the plethora of analytical methods that have studied the biological fate of olive oil-derived bioactive compounds, no validated methodology has been published to date for the simultaneous determination of OE, along with all its major metabolites. In this study, a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the quantification of OE, simultaneously with its main metabolites hydroxytyrosol, 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy-phenol or homovanillyl alcohol, 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid or homovanillic acid, and elenolic acid in rat plasma matrix. Samples were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS prior to and after enzymatic treatment. A solid-phase extraction step with high mean recovery for all compounds was performed as sample pretreatment. Calibration curves were linear for all bioactive compounds over the range studied, while the method exhibited good accuracy, intra- and inter-day precision. The limit of detection was in the picogram range (per milliliterof plasma) for HT and OE and in the nanogram range (per milliliter of plasma) for the other analytes, and the method was simple and rapid. The developed methodology was successfully applied for the simultaneous quantification of OE and its aforementioned metabolites in rat plasma samples, thus demonstrating its suitability for pharmacokinetics, as well as bioavailability and metabolism studies.",1
"Phlorin (3,5-dihydroxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside), an orange peel marker, has been searched in 45 species and varieties of Citrus.

The phlorin content in C. reticulata peel extract varies from 0 to 1012 mg L(-)(1) with a mean of 162 mg L(-)(1). On the contrary, phlorin was not found in mandarin and clementine juices except for mandarin ""Commune"" and ""Beauty"" (33 and 30 mg L(-)(1), respectively). In the 14 species of oranges and varieties, phlorin was detected in juices and peel extracts with a mean of 22 and 492 mg L(-)(1), respectively, while for grapefruits, means were 108 mg L(-)(1) in juices and 982 mg L(-)(1) for peel extracts. Tangors and tangelos which are hybrids (C. reticulata x C. sinensis and C. reticulata x C. paradisi, respectively) are characterized by the systematic presence of phlorin in peels (mean: 406 and 659 mg L(-)(1), respectively) while in juices its presence could be variable (0-73 mg L(-)(1)). These heterogeneity and values may be explained by the genetic variability of these hybrids and the phlorin content of their parentage group.",1

"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy, with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) accounting for 10-25 % of cases. We identified ELOVL5 as a super-enhancer-driven oncogene that is highly expressed in T-ALL and associated with poor overall survival. Through H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis of patient samples and cellular models, we confirmed that ELOVL5 is transcriptionally regulated by super-enhancers. Functional studies demonstrated that ELOVL5 knockdown suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in T-ALL cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In mouse xenograft models, silencing ELOVL5 reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival. RNA-seq analysis further revealed that ELOVL5 promotes T-ALL progression by activating MYC signaling and upregulating SERBP1, a critical downstream effector. Consistently, SERBP1 silencing also inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in T-ALL cells. Collectively, these findings establish ELOVL5 as a super-enhancer-associated oncogenic regulator that drives T-ALL progression through the ELOVL5-SERBP1-MYC axis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.",0
"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is an effective bridging treatment for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, repetitive CAR-T cell therapy and allo-HSCT can only be performed in a few patients because of technical difficulties and patients' physical, economic, and social conditions. A 23-year-old female patient with second relapsed B-cell ALL (B-ALL) underwent human-murine chimeric CD19 CAR-T cell therapy twice, human-murine chimeric CD22 CAR-T cell therapy once, and humanized CD19 CAR-T cell therapy once. Moreover, she was sequentially bridged to her mother donor allo-HSCT once and cousin donor allo-HSCT once.

"The phenolic compounds composition, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity of different table olives from Portugal, namely, natural black olives ""Galega"", black ripe olive ""Negrinha de Freixo"", Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) ""Azeitona de Conserva Negrinha de Freixo"" olives, and ""Azeitona de Conserva de Elvas e Campo Maior"" Designation of Origin (DO) olives, were investigated. The analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and seven compounds were identified and quantified: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, 5-O-caffeoilquinic acid, verbascoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, and luteolin. The antioxidant activity was assessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals, and the beta-carotene linoleate model system. The antioxidant activity was correlated with the amount of phenolics found in each sample. The antimicrobial activity was screened using Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). PDO and DO table olives revealed a wide range of antimicrobial activity. C. albicans was resistant to all the analyzed extracts.",1
"Atherosclerosis (AS), a lipid-induced inflammatory condition of the arteries, is a primary contributor to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases including stroke. Arctium lappa L. leaf (ALL), an edible and medicinal herb in China, has been documented and commonly used for treating stroke since the ancient times. However, the elucidations on its anti-AS effects and molecular mechanism remain insufficient. To investigate the AS-ameliorating effects and the underlying mechanism of action of an ethanolic extract of leaves of Arctium lappa L. (ALLE). ALLE was reflux extracted using with 70% ethanol. An HPLC method was established to monitor the quality of ALLE. High fat diet (HFD) and vitamin D3-induced experimental AS in rats were used to determine the in vivo effects; and oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced RAW264.7 macrophage foam cells were used for in vitro assays. Simvatatin was used as positive control. Biochemical assays were implemented to ascertain the secretions of lipids and pro-inflammatory mediators. Haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Oil red O stains were employed to assess histopathological alterations and lipid accumulation conditions, respectively. CCK-8 assays were used to measure cytotoxicity. Immunoblotting assay was conducted to measure protein levels. ALLE treatment significantly ameliorated lipid deposition and histological abnormalities of aortas and livers in AS rats; improved the imbalances of serum lipids including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); notably attenuated serum concentrations of inflammation-associated cytokines/molecules including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, VCAM-1, ICAM-1and MMP-9. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that ALLE suppressed the phosphorylation/activation of PI3K, Akt and NF-κB in AS rat aortas and in cultured foam cells. Additionally, the PI3K agonist 740Y-P notably reversed the in vitro inhibitory effects of ALLE on lipid deposition, productions of TC, TNF-α and IL-6, and protein levels of molecules of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB singnaling pathways. ALLE ameliorates HFD- and vitamin D3-induced experimental AS by modulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses, and underlying mechanisms involves inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB singnaling pathways. The findings of this study provide scientific justifications for the traditional application of ALL in managing atherosclerotic diseases.",0
"Accurate, simple methods are needed to determine tannic acid (gallotannin), which is present endogenously in many foods and fermented beverages such as wine and cider. A method complementary to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) uses high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Corasil-II, with a multisolvent gradient system. The calibration curves are made with both monomeric and dimeric gallic acid. The latter is isolated from tannic acid by preparative HPLC and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and TLC. Tannic acid is then determined in a beer ethyl acetate extract by quantitative chromatography of its gallic and digallic acid components. Because endogenous digallic acid has not been reported in beer, determination of this component in beer confirms the presence of tannic acid and its use in beer processing. The HPLC method offers an alternative to the TLC method and can be used to confirm TLC results.",1

"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a malignant hematologic disease caused by the transformation and uncontrolled proliferation of T-cell precursors. T-ALL is generally thought to originate in the thymus since lymphoblasts express phenotypic markers comparable to those described in thymocytes in distinct stages of development. Although around 50% of T-ALL patients present a thymic mass, T-ALL is characterized by peripheral blood and bone marrow involvement, and central nervous system (CNS) infiltration is one of the most severe complications of the disease. The CNS invasion is related to the expression of specific adhesion molecules and receptors commonly expressed in developing T cells, such as L-selectin, CD44, integrins, and chemokine receptors. Furthermore, T-ALL blasts also express neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and cognate receptors that are usually present in the CNS and can affect both the brain and thymus, participating in the crosstalk between the organs. This review discusses how the thymus-brain connections, mediated by innervation and common molecules and receptors, can impact the development and migration of T-ALL blasts, including CNS infiltration.",0
"Mitotic arrest deficient 2 like 1 (MAD2L1) has been extensively studied in several malignancies; however, its role in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) remains unclear. The expression of MAD2L1 was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The biological functions of MAD2L1 in B-ALL were explored through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay (EDU), transwell assay, flow cytometry and xenograft models. The Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation were utilized to evaluate the interplay between MAD2L1 and the TYK2/STAT3 pathway. The luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay were employed to identify interactions between STAT3 and MAD2L1. We demonstrated that MAD2L1 was markedly upregulated in B-ALL, and its expression level not only correlated with the relapse and remission of the condition but also with a poor prognosis. MAD2L1 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of B-ALL cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas MAD2L1 knockdown had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, MAD2L1 induces the progression of B-ALL by activating the TYK2/STAT3 signaling pathway to phosphorylate. Interestingly, STAT3 induces the expression of MAD2L1 by binding directly to its promoter region, resulting in a positive-feedback loop of MAD2L1/TYK2/STAT3. This study uncovered a reciprocal loop of MAD2L1/TYK2/STAT3, which contributed to the development of B-ALL. Therefore, MAD2L1 can be considered a potential diagnostic biomarker as well as a novel therapeutic target for B-ALL.",0
"Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.",1
"Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has curative potential for myeloid malignancies, though many patients cannot tolerate myeloablative conditioning with high-dose chemotherapy alone or with total-body irradiation (TBI). Here we report long-term outcomes from a phase I/II study using iodine-131 (131I)-anti-CD45 antibody BC8 combined with nonmyeloablative conditioning prior to HLA-haploidentical HCT in adults with high-risk relapsed/ refractory acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia (AML or ALL), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00589316). Patients received a tracer diagnostic dose before a therapeutic infusion of 131I-anti-CD45 to deliver escalating doses (12-26 Gy) to the dose-limiting organ. Patients subsequently received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide (CY), and 2 Gy TBI conditioning before haploidentical marrow HCT. GVHD prophylaxis was posttransplant CY plus tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Twenty-five patients (20 with AML, 4 ALL and 1 high-risk MDS) were treated; 8 had ≥ 5% blasts by morphology (range 9%-20%), and 7 had previously failed HCT. All 25 patients achieved a morphologic remission 28 days after HCT, with only 2 patients showing minimal residual disease (0.002-1.8%) by flow cytometry. Median time to engraftment was 15 days for neutrophils and 23 days for platelets. Point estimates for overall survival and progression-free survival were 40% and 32% at 1 year, and 24% at 2 years, respectively. Point estimates of relapse and nonrelapse mortality at 1 year were 56% and 12%, respectively. 131I-anti-CD45 radioimmunotherapy prior to haploidentical HCT is feasible and can be curative in some patients, including those with disease, without additional toxicity.",0
"To study the significance of E-cadherin and the association between E-cadherin methylation status and prognosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by examining the mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin and its gene methylation status in bone marrow mononuclear cells of children with ALL. The samples of 5 mL bone marrow blood were collected from 42 children with ALL who were diagnosed for the first time at diagnosis (pre-treatment group) and on day 33 of induction chemotherapy (post-treatment group). RT-qPCR, Western blot, and methylation-specific PCR were used to measure the mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin and the methylation level of the The mRNA and protein expression levels of E-cadherin in the post-treatment group were significantly higher than those in the pre-treatment group ( E-cadherin expression is associated with the development of ALL in children, and its decreased expression and increased methylation level may indicate a poor prognosis.",0
"Selinexor, a first-in-class exportin1 (XPO1) inhibitor, is an attractive anti-tumor agent because of its unique mechanisms of action; however, its dose-dependent toxicity and lack of biomarkers preclude its wide use in clinical applications. To identify key molecules/pathways regulating selinexor sensitivity, we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 dropout screens using two B-ALL lines. We identified, for the first time, that paralogous DDX19A and DDX19B RNA helicases modulate selinexor sensitivity by regulating MCL1 mRNA nuclear export. While single depletion of either DDX19A or DDX19B barely altered MCL1 protein levels, depletion of both significantly attenuated MCL1 mRNA nuclear export, reducing MCL1 protein levels. Importantly, combining selinexor treatment with depletion of either DDX19A or DDX19B markedly induced intrinsic apoptosis of leukemia cells, an effect rescued by MCL1 overexpression. Analysis of Depmap datasets indicated that a subset of T-ALL lines expresses minimal DDX19B mRNA levels. Moreover, we found that either selinexor treatment or DDX19A depletion effectively induced apoptosis of T-ALL lines expressing low DDX19B levels. We conclude that XPO1 and DDX19A/B coordinately regulate cellular MCL1 levels and propose that DDX19A/B could serve as biomarkers for selinexor treatment. Moreover, pharmacological targeting of DDX19 paralogs may represent a potential strategy to induce intrinsic apoptosis in leukemia cells.",0
"Abstract Alkyl‐ and alkenylresorcinols were extracted with acetone from whole kernels of wheat, rye and various triticales. The resorcinols were ethylated, analysed by GC on a capillary column and further identified by GC‐MS. Alkylresorcinols with chain lengths of C 15 , C 17 , C 19 , C 21 , C 23 and C 25 and pairs of isomeric C 17 , C 19 , C 21 , C 23 and C 25 alkenylresorcinols were quantified in all samples. The content of alk(en)ylresorcinols was highest in rye, intermediate in triticale and lowest in wheat. The relative composition of the resorcinols differed between grains, with a higher content of the C 19 alkylresorcinol in rye and of the C 21 alkylresorcinol in wheat. Wheat and three lines of triticale were harvested at three stages of maturity after the grain filling period was ended (water content ∼40,30 and 20%). During this period of time the gross chemical composition, water extract viscosity, and content and relative composition of the alk(en)ylresorcinols, were relatively constant.",1
"Immunotherapies targeting natural killer (NK) cell receptors have shown promise against leukaemia. Unfortunately, cancer immunosuppressive mechanisms that alter NK cell phenotype prevent such approaches from being successful. The study utilises advanced cytometry to examine how cancer immunosuppressive pathways affect NK cell phenotypic changes in clinical samples. In this study, we conducted a high-dimensional examination of the cell surface expression of 16 NK cell receptors in paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, as well as in samples of non-age matched adult peripheral blood (APB) and umbilical cord blood (UCB). An unsupervised analysis was carried out in order to identify NK cell populations present in paediatric leukaemias. We observed that leukaemia NK cells clustered together with UCB NK cells and expressed relatively higher levels of the NKG2A receptor compared to APB NK cells. In addition, CD56 We provide an in-depth analysis of NK cell populations in paediatric leukaemia patients. These results support the development of immunotherapies targeting immunosuppressive receptors, such as NKG2A, to enhance innate immunity against paediatric leukaemia.",0
"Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber and polyphenols of vegetables and fruits improve lipid metabolism and prevent the oxidation of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which hinder the development of atherosclerosis. The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber. It can be supposed that among the studied fruit, lichi, guava, and ripe mango may be preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis.",1

"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) as postremission treatment is recommended for Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) in current guidelines. However, comparisons of later generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) plus chemotherapy with allo-HSCT have yielded similar outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate allo-HSCT in first complete remission (CR1) versus chemotherapy for adult Ph+ ALL in the TKI era. Pooled assessment of the hematologic and molecular complete response rates was performed after 3-month TKI treatment. Hazard ratios (HRs) were determined for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) benefit with allo-HSCT. The effect of measurable residual disease status on survival benefit was also analyzed. Thirty-nine retrospective and prospective single-arm cohort studies involving 5054 patients were included. Combined HRs indicated that in the general population, allo-HSCT favorably influenced DFS and OS. Achieving complete molecular remission (CMR) within 3 months after starting induction was a favorable survival prognostic factor regardless of whether the patient had undergone allo-HSCT. Among the patients with CMR, survival rates in the nontransplant subgroup were comparable with those in the transplant subgroup, with the estimated 5-year OS of 64% versus 58% and 5-year DFS of 58% versus 51%, respectively. The use of next-generation TKIs results in a higher proportion of patients achieving CMR (ponatinib 82% vs. imatinib 53%), while improving survival in nontransplant patients. Our novel findings suggest that combination chemotherapy plus TKIs leads to a comparable survival benefit as with allo-HSCT for MRD-negative (CMR) patients. This study provides novel evidence for allo-HSCT indications for Ph+ ALL in CR1 in the TKI era.",0

"Two samples of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) from China and one from Luxembourg were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to reveal the possibilities of growing tartary buckwheat herb as a possible source of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin. The content of rutin was determined as up to 3% dry weight (DW) in tartary buckwheat herb. Quercitrin values were in the range of 0.01-0.05% DW. Only traces of quercetin were detected in just some of the samples. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained more rutin (about 0.8-1.7% DW) than common buckwheat seeds (0.01% DW). Rutin and quercetin content in seeds depends on variety and growing conditions. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained traces of quercitrin and quercetin, which were not found in common buckwheat seeds.",1

"The deregulation of BCL2 family proteins plays a crucial role in leukemia development. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of this family of proteins is becoming a prevalent treatment method. However, due to the emergence of primary and acquired resistance, efficacy is compromised in clinical or preclinical settings. We developed a drug sensitivity prediction model utilizing a deep tabular learning algorithm for the assessment of venetoclax sensitivity in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient samples. Through analysis of predicted venetoclax-sensitive and resistant samples, PLK1 was identified as a cooperating partner for the BCL2-mediated antiapoptotic program. This finding was substantiated by additional data obtained through phosphoproteomics and high-throughput kinase screening. Concurrent treatment using venetoclax with PLK1-specific inhibitors and PLK1 knockdown demonstrated a greater therapeutic effect on T-ALL cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and engrafted mice compared with using each treatment separately. Mechanistically, the attenuation of PLK1 enhanced BCL2 inhibitor sensitivity through upregulation of BCL2L13 and PMAIP1 expression. Collectively, these findings underscore the dependency of T-ALL on PLK1 and postulate a plausible regulatory mechanism.",0
"The two main flavonol glycosides present in broccoli florets were identified as quercetin 3-O-sophoroside and kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside. Three minor glucosides of quercetin and kaempferol were also detected, namely isoquercitrin, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and a kaempferol diglucoside. The sophorosides Of quercetin and kaempferol were present in raw florets at a level of 65 mg kg-1 and 166 mg kg-1 fresh weight, respectively. The total content of quercetin and kaempferol glycosides expressed as aglycone was 43 and 94 micrograms g-1 fresh weight, respectively, and these agree with other recently published data. During the cooking process only 14-28% of the individual glucosides were retained in the cooked tissue, the remainder being largely leached into the cooking water with only a small loss attributed to the formation of the respective aglycones.",1
"Several anthocyanin-derived pigments that showed UV-visible spectra different from those of the original grape anthocyanins were detected by HPLC-DAD analysis in 1-year-old bottled Port wines from the Douro region. Among these, three malvidin 3-glucoside derived pigments were detected in large amounts, representing approximately 60% of the total anthocyanidin monoglucosides content. These pigments were isolated, purified, and identified by LSI-MS and NMR ((1)H, DQF-COSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) techniques. The major pigment is malvidin 3-glucoside pyruvic adduct, previously characterized, and the other two corresponded to its respective acetyl and coumaroyl glucoside derivatives. The latter is reported for the first time in red wines.",1
"Steroid-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) is a frequent but often overlooked complication in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Corticosteroid use, while essential for treatment, may result in transient or persistent elevations in blood glucose. This study aimed to determine the incidence of SIH and identify potential risk factors. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 91 pediatric ALL patients receiving corticosteroids. Hyperglycemia was defined as blood glucose ≥200 mg/dL on at least two occasions, and borderline/transient hyperglycemia as levels between 140 and 199 mg/dL. Blood glucose was monitored throughout therapy, and demographic, clinical, and treatment variables were analyzed for associations with SIH. Among the 91 patients, 11 (12.1%) developed hyperglycemia and 12 (13.2%) had transient/borderline hyperglycemia, while 68 (74.7%) remained normoglycemic. The onset of SIH occurred between days 2 and 16 of steroid therapy, with peaks on days 4 and 10. Patients receiving dexamethasone (82.4%) had slightly higher rates of hyperglycemia compared to those on prednisolone (17.6%), though not statistically significant (p = 0.663). Similarly, no significant associations were observed with age, gender, body mass index (BMI), or risk stratification. Higher steroid doses showed a trend toward increased risk, but without statistical significance (p = 0.985). SIH occurred in approximately 1 in 8 pediatric ALL patients, though no significant risk factors were identified. These findings underscore the importance of routine glucose monitoring during corticosteroid therapy, regardless of patient demographics or regimen. Tailored surveillance and early intervention protocols are recommended to mitigate potential complications and improve clinical outcomes.",0
"The difference in urinary excretion of mammalian and plant lignans in rats was determined after oral administration of equivalent doses (25 mg/kg of body weight) of 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR), lariciresinol (LAR), matairesinol (MR), and secoisolariciresinol (SECO). Twenty-four hours-urine samples were collected after a single dose and after administration of one dose/day for 10 days. Eight lignans were analysed in urine extracts using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method showing good sensitivity and repeatability. After a single dose of HMR, LAR, MR, and SECO, the main metabolites were 7-hydroxyenterolactone (HENL), cyclolariciresinol (CLAR), enterolactone (ENL), and enterodiol (END), respectively, but after 10-day exposure ENL was the main metabolite of all the tested lignans, showing a considerably higher excretion than after a single dose. Metabolic transformations of plant lignans into each other could also be observed.",1
"Developing nanoscale platforms with high integration, assembly efficiency, and structural stability for performing complex computations in specific cells remains a significant challenge. To address this, the Three-dimensional Hierarchical Octahedral Robotic (THOR) DNA nanoplatform is introduced, which integrates targeting, logic computation, and sensing modules within a single framework. This nanoplatform specifically binds to cancer cell surface proteins, releasing aptamer-linked fuel chains to initiate subsequent computational processes. Three logic gates efficiently compute any arbitrary binary combination of target proteins. The sensing module employs catalytic hairpin assembly for detecting specific miRNAs with high sensitivity. THOR demonstrates robust functionality both in vitro and in situ. As a proof-of-concept, this nanoplatform to distinguish acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients from other leukemia subtypes and healthy participants, achieving 100% accuracy is applied. Additionally, this approach reliably monitored the therapeutic progress of ALL patients, showing strong concordance with bone marrow smear results. The THOR platform highlights the feasibility of constructing a reliable, hierarchical, and multifunctional analytical system based on a single DNA polyhedron. It offers a promising auxiliary tool for clinical diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring.",0
"Total anthocyanin pigments increased from 74.7 to 317 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW) from underripe to overripe for Marion blackberries and from 69.9 to 164 mg/100 g FW for Evergreen blackberries. Total phenolics did not show a marked change with maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant activities, while increasing with ripening, also did not show the marked change that total anthocyanins exhibited. The impact of variation due to plots, subsampling, sample preparation, and measurement on Marion composition was examined in detail. Plot-to-plot and sample differences were the major contributors to variation, with sample preparation being an important contributor for some parameters. Measurement variation was a relatively small component of the total variation. Total anthocyanins for 11 blackberry cultivars ranged from 131 to 256 mg/100 g FW (mean = 198), total phenolics ranged from 682 to 1056 mg GAE/100 g FW (mean = 900), oxygen radical absorbance capacity ranged from 37.6 to 75.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 50.2), and ferric reducing antioxidant power ranged from 63.5 to 91.5 micromol TE/g FW (mean = 77.5).",1
"The main phenolic compounds in cortex tissues of apples and pears are hydroxycinnamic derivatives (HCD) and flavanols (FLA). Phenolic content (initial and residual) was determined by HPLC. The degree of browning was determined by the simultaneous measurements of soluble (absorbance at 400 nm) and insoluble (lightness L*) brown pigments. In apples, the sum of absorbance and lightness, expressing the extent of browning, is closely correlated to the amount of phenolics (HCD and FLA) degraded. Maturity does not appear to play a major role in the ability of apples to develop browning. In pears, no correlation was found between these sums and the amount of phenolics (initial or degraded). However, L* was correlated with the amount of two flavanols. The extent of browning seemed to depend on the maturity of pears. A better control of browning would probably consist firstly in a selection of cultivars with a low content in chlorogenic acid. Secondly, flavanol content and the relative balance of HCD and FLA are of great importance in the susceptibility to browning.",1
"An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, medlar, grape, and tea.",1
"Twenty-four flavonoids have been determined in 66 Citrus species and near-citrus relatives, grown in the same field and year, by means of reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Statistical methods have been applied to find relations among the species. The F ratios of 21 flavonoids obtained by applying ANOVA analysis are significant, indicating that a classification of the species using these variables is reasonable to pursue. Principal component analysis revealed that the distributions of Citrus species belonging to different classes were largely in accordance with Tanaka's classification system.",1
"Bone bruises and concomitant ligament injuries after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries have attracted attention, but their correlation and potential clinical significance remain unclear. To assess the relationship between bone bruises and concomitant ligamentous injuries in ACL injuries. Systematic review. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was completed from inception to October 20, 2021. All articles that evaluated the relationship between bone bruises and related ligaments injuries were included. Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was used for quality assessment as well as Review Manager 5.3 was used for data analysis. A total of 19 studies evaluating 3292 patients were included. After meta-analysis, anterolateral ligament (ALL) injuries were associated with bone bruising on the lateral tibial plateau (LTP) (RR = 2.33; 95% CI 1.44-3.77; For individuals with an ACL injury, bone bruises of the LTP, LFC, and MTP can assist in the diagnosis of ALL injuries. Furthermore, femoral bruising has potential diagnostic value for MCL injuries. Knowing these associations allows surgeons to be alert to ACL-related ligament injuries on MRI and during operations in future clinical practice.",0
"The phenolic composition and antioxidant activities [TEAC, ORAC, FRAP] of consumer brews (1 tea bag in 230 ml for 1 min) of seven different brands of black tea from the British market were investigated. The main phenolic compounds identified were epigallocatechin gallate, four theaflavins, as well as epicatechin gallate, theogallin (tentative assignment), quercetin-3-rutinoside and 4-caffeoyl quinic acid. Thearubigins represented an estimated 75-82% of the total phenolics. Further, polyphenol fractions were in decreasing order theaflavins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, gallic acids and hydroxycinnamates. On average, a cup of a consumer brew of black tea is providing polyphenols at the level of 262mg GAE/serving, of which 65 mg were assigned to individual polyphenols. The antioxidant activity of black tea preparations is higher than that of most reported dietary agents on a daily basis. Correlations were observed between the antioxidant activities and the sum of all quantified polyphenols by HPLC analysis as well as with the total phenolics. Treatment of the black tea brew with simulated gastric juice resulted in a significant increase of the identified theaflavins implying a partial cleavage of thearubigins in the environment of the gastric lumen. Therefore, black tea can be considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and/or antioxidants.",1
"Our current system of perioperative education offers variable amounts of information to families, contributing to inequitable care. We hypothesized implementing web-based perioperative education for gastrostomy tube (GT) surgery would be feasible without causing patient harm. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing e-health education to standard education for families of children undergoing GT placement at our center between 6/2023-4/2024. Patients randomized to e-health were assigned preparatory pathways at three times: prior to surgery, prior to hospital discharge, and prior to outpatient follow up. The standard education group received standard perioperative education prior to hospital discharge and at clinic follow up. All participants were asked to complete study surveys at the three timepoints. Clinical outcomes data were collected to assess potential patient harm. We enrolled 62 families: 30 randomized to e-health and 32 to standard education. Demographic factors were similar between groups. Eighty-seven percent of e-health families created an account and viewed the web-based content. Both groups reported high readiness for surgery with 89 % or more reporting GT surgery will benefit my child's health and they were comfortable deciding to elect for GT surgery. The rate of common clinical complications did not differ between groups. An e-health platform to provide perioperative education to families of patients undergoing GT surgery is feasible without negatively impacting patient outcomes. This approach has the potential to improve on our current standard by offering education in a family's preferred language, their own pace, and their own schedule. Level II - randomized controlled trial.",0
"The anthocyanin composition of boysenberry (Rubusloganbaccus × baileyanus Britt) extract was determined by LC-ESI-MS. Four anthocyanins were identified, all comprising a cyanidin-anthocyanidin-type skeleton. The two major components were identified as the disaccharide cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside and the monosaccharide cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. The two less abundant components were identified as the rutinosides, cyanidin-3-O-2G-glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, respectively. These same four anthocyanins were also detected in human urine following a dosing study with boysenberry extract indicating that glycosylated anthocyanins can be absorbed from the gut and excreted intact in the urine. Several anthocyanin metabolites were also detected in the urine and were identified by LC-ESI-MS as monoglucuronides of peonidin, cyanidin and pelargonidin. The results suggest that anthocyanins consumed as part of a diet are bioavailable and are present as intact or metabolized forms in the body.",1
"The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of some citrus fruits. The contents of dietary fibre, total polyphenols, essential phenolics, ascorbic acid and some trace elements of lemons, oranges and grapefruits were determined and compared with their total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP). There were no significant differences in the contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in the studied peeled fruits or their peels. The contents of total, soluble and insoluble dietary fibre in peels were significantly higher than in peeled fruits (P< 0.05 in all cases). The peeled lemons, oranges and grapefruits contain 164±10.3; 154±10.2 and 135±10.1 and their peels 190±10.6; 179±10.5 and 155±10.3 mg/100 g of total polyphenols, respectively. The content of total polyphenols in peeled lemons and their peels was significantly higher than in peeled oranges and grapefruits and their peels, respectively. The content of total polyphenols in the peels was significantly higher than in peeled fruits (P< 0.05 in all cases). The same results were obtained in the investigation of essential phenolics and ascorbic acid. The content of Fe in peeled lemons and their peels was significantly higher than in peeled oranges and grapefruits and their peels, respectively. Also the TRAP was significantly higher in peeled lemons and their peels than in peeled oranges and grapefruits and their peels, respectively. In all three fruits, the TRAP was significantly higher in peels than in peeled fruits (P< 0.05). In conclusion, lemons possess the highest antioxidant potential among the studied citrus fruits and are preferable for dietary prevention of cardiovascular and other diseases. The peels of all citrus fruits are rich in dietary fibres and phenolic compounds and suitable for industrial processing.",1
"Unconventional genetic subtypes of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) were analysed to compare their frequency and their impact on outcomes between children and young adults in Taiwan. Unconventional subtypes were found in 23.0% of 456 paediatric B-ALL and 24.5% of 139 young adult B-ALL. The most frequently unconventional subtype both in children and young adults was BCR::ABL1-like, which could be subdivided into different kinase-altering aberrations in 67.3% of children and 78.6% of young adults. CRLF2-R was more frequent in children, while IL7R mutations were more common in young adults. In children, favourable outcomes were observed in patients with DUX4-R and PAX5alt, whereas those with BCR::ABL1-like and MEF2D-R had inferior outcomes. BCR::ABL1-like and MEF2D-R were also the independent predictors of inferior event-free survival in children. Conversely, most unconventional subtypes in young adults were associated with adverse outcomes except for DUX4-R. We found a lower incidence of BCR::ABL1-like and a better prognosis for paediatric PAX5alt in Taiwan compared to the West. Additionally, genetic differences were identified between paediatric and young adult BCR::ABL1-like subtypes. The extremely poor prognosis for unclassified young adults highlights the potential use of further subdivision of unfavourable genetic subtypes in refining risk classification and treatment optimization.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and one of the success stories in cancer therapeutics. Risk-directed therapy based on clinical, biologic and genetic features has played a significant role in this accomplishment. Despite the observed improvement in survival rates, leukemia remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Implementation of next-generation genomic and transcriptomic sequencing tools has illustrated the genomic landscape of ALL. However, the underlying dynamic changes at protein level still remain a challenge. Proteomics is a cutting-edge technology aimed at deciphering the mechanisms, pathways, and the degree to which the proteome impacts leukemia subtypes. Advances in mass spectrometry enable high-throughput collection of global proteomic profiles, representing an opportunity to unveil new biological markers and druggable targets. The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a comprehensive overview of studies that have utilized applications of proteomics in an attempt to gain insight into the pathogenesis and identification of biomarkers in childhood ALL.",0
"Gallic acid is one of the main phenolic components of black tea. The objective of this study was to identify urinary gallic acid metabolites with potential for use as markers of black tea intake. In an initial study, nine compounds, assessed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, were found to increase in concentration in urine after 3 cups of black tea over 3 h. A subsequent study employed a controlled crossover design in which 10 subjects consumed 5 cups per day of black tea or water for 4 weeks in random order. Twenty-four hour urine samples were collected at the end of each period. Of the 9 candidate compounds identified in the initial study, only 3 were present at higher concentrations in urine of all 10 subjects during tea-drinking in comparison to water-drinking periods. These compounds were identified as 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and 3, 4-O-dimethylgallic acid, all methyl ether derivatives of gallic acid. It is suggested that these compounds have the potential to be used as markers of black tea intake.",1
"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) modulates leukemia cell apoptosis, proliferation, and cell cycle arrest in the progression of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study intended to investigate the dysregulation of PLK1 and its association with induction therapy response and prognosis in pediatric ALL patients. Bone marrow mononuclear cell samples were collected from 90 pediatric ALL patients at baseline and on the 15th day of induction therapy (D15), as well as from 20 controls after enrollment, for the detection of PLK1 by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. PLK1 was increased in pediatric ALL patients compared with controls ( P <0.001). In pediatric ALL patients, PLK1 decreased from baseline to D15 ( P <0.001). Lower PLK1 at baseline was associated with a good prednisone response ( P =0.002), while decreased PLK1 at D15 was related to good prednisone response ( P =0.001), better bone marrow response ( P =0.025), and favorable risk stratification ( P =0.014). In addition, reduced PLK1 at baseline was linked with better event-free survival (EFS) ( P =0.046), and decreased PLK1 at D15 was related to prolonged EFS ( P =0.027) and overall survival (OS) ( P =0.047). Moreover, PLK1 decline ≥25% was linked to favorable EFS ( P =0.015) and OS ( P =0.008). Further multivariate Cox proportional regression analysis revealed that PLK1 decline ≥25% was independently linked with prolonged EFS (hazard ratio (HR)=0.324, P =0.024) and OS (HR=0.211, P =0.019). The reduction of PLK1 after induction therapy reflects a good treatment response and correlates with a favorable survival profile in pediatric ALL patients.",0
"We describe a liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of the secoiridoid oleuropein and its bioactive metabolite hydroxytyrosol in rat plasma and urine. Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly found as glucuronides.",1
"T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with a less favorable prognosis. The genetic background of T-ALL is widely heterogeneous, with the co-occurrence of multiple genetic abnormalities. The STIL-TAL1 rearrangement results from a submicroscopic deletion on chromosome 1p33 and is present in 15 - 25% of T-ALL cases. Submicroscopic deletions are not detected by conventional cytogenetic ana-lyses but can be identified through array comparative genomic hybridization and/or high-throughput RNA sequencing. Patients with the STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibit distinct characteristics, such as a young age, high white blood cell count, typical immunophenotype, and specific genetic abnormalities. However, the clinical, laboratory, and prognostic significance of this rearrangement remains unclear. This study was performed to identify STIL-TAL1 rearrangement resulting from submicroscopic 1p33 deletion in T-ALL and to investigate the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of T-ALL patients with STIL-TAL1 fusion. A total of 15 T-ALL patients were enrolled over a 6-year period (2018 - 2023). We evaluated clinical features and laboratory findings, including immunophenotyping, multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), karyotype analysis, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), on bone marrow or peripheral blood specimens at the diagnostic stage. Multiplex RT-PCR was performed on 15 cases of T-ALL, and STIL-TAL1 fusion was detected in 3 cases (20.0%, 3/15). STIL-TAL1-positive patients were all male, under 40 years of age, and presented with lymph node enlargement, hepatosplenomegaly, and mediastinal mass. They showed relatively higher leukocyte counts and hemoglobin levels, but lower platelet counts compared to STIL-TAL1 negative cases. Immunophenotyping analysis revealed higher sCD3 and lower CD34 expression with no aberrant myeloid lineage expression. CMA demonstrated a 63-kb heterozygous deletion at 1p33, along with additional copy number abnormalities such as TCR rearrangements and a biallelic CDKN2A deletion. The T-ALL with STIL-TAL1 fusion exhibits unique clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics. Further multi-center studies, incorporating cytogenetic and molecular analyses, are needed to elucidate the detailed pathophysiology, characteristics, and clinical significance of this gene rearrangement.",0
"Rapeseed meal is the dry residue of the rapeseed de-oiling process. It contains more phenolic compounds than any other oilseed meal. In analysis, rapeseed phenolic esters, mainly sinapine, are usually hydrolyzed to free phenolic acids, because sinapine is not available as a commercial standard. In this study, the efficiencies of different enzymes and enzyme preparations in hydrolyzing sinapine to sinapic acid were explored. The main phenolics in rapeseed meal were sinapine and sinapic acid. In rapeseed oil, the main phenolics were vinylsyringol, sinapine and sinapic acid. In hydrolyzing rapeseed meal, ferulic acid esterase and Ultraflo L were as effective in hydrolyzing sinapine as sodium hydroxide. Over 90% of sinapic acid derivatives were hydrolyzed to yield sinapic acid. Compared to base hydrolysis, enzyme treatment was not only as efficient but also less destructive to the liberated phenolics. Thus, enzymatic hydrolysis is a recommended procedure for optimal analysis of rapeseed phenolics. In rapeseed oils, hydrolysis was best applied in crude post-expelled rapeseed oils with high phenolic content.",1
"Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using these authentic compounds, the concentrations of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma. The present study is the first report elucidating the chemical structures and changes in individual concentrations in rat plasma of glucuronides derived from orally administered hesperidin.",1
"The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.",1
"The effect of air-drying parameters on antioxidant activity and changes in antioxidant compounds of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) were studied. Broccoli samples were dried to 70 g kg−1 moisture content using temperatures ranging from 50 to 100 °C and air flow-rates from 1.20 to 2.25 m s−1, resulting in drying times from 25 to 90 min. Temperature, owing to its positive effect on the oxidation kinetics, was negatively correlated with ascorbic acid and free and total polyphenol contents but not with kaempferol, even though the sample dried at the highest temperature showed the lowest kaempferol content. The air flow-rate was positively correlated with the total (TPP) and free (FPP) polyphenol contents because it led to a reduction in the drying time. No correlation was found between air flow-rate and kaempferol content. Air flow-rate and temperature positively affected the antioxidant activity by reducing the drying time. High-temperature, short-time processes maximised the antioxidant activity of broccoli owing to the negative effect of drying time on antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of broccoli was positively and significantly correlated with the FPP content but not with TPP and kaempferol. The evaluation of hydroxymethylfurfural content as an indicator of the occurrence of a Maillard reaction in dried broccoli did not support the hypothesis of a contribution of MRPs to the antioxidant activity of dried broccoli.",1

"Polyphenols in the peel and pulp of 15 Basque cider apple varieties were determined by accelerated solvent extraction followed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. It was observed that the polyphenolic composition in apple peel depended on varieties, whereas the main classes of phenolic compounds in apple pulp were flavan-3-ols and hydroxycinnamic acids in all cases, representing both together between 86 and 95% of total polyphenols assayed.",1
"Optimal frontline use of active agents in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL) is prudent to improve outcomes. We report the long-term follow-up of the phase 2 trial of HyperCVAD with nelarabine and pegylated asparaginase (Original cohort). In the latest protocol iteration venetoclax was added to the induction/consolidation regimen (Venetoclax cohort). Eligible patients were adults with untreated T-ALL/LBL or after minimal therapy and with adequate organ function. Primary endpoint of this analysis was improvement in 2-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with venetoclax. From Aug 2007 to Dec 2024, 145 patients, at a median age of 35.4 years, were treated; 46 (33.8%) were in the venetoclax cohort. At median follow-up (mFU) of 62.4 months, 5-year PFS, duration of response (DOR), and OS were 63.7%, 72.0% and 66.2% respectively. In the venetoclax cohort (mFU 24.4 months) 2-year PFS (87.9% versus 64.1%, p = 0.03) and 2-year DOR (93.6% versus 69.2%, p = 0.005) were superior to the original cohort (mFU 89.4 months) and 2-year OS appeared better (87.8% versus 73.9%, p = 0.16). Febrile neutropenia was the most common serious adverse event, seen in 60% patients. The addition of venetoclax to HyperCVAD-nelarabine-pegylated asparaginase was tolerable and led to improvement in DOR and PFS.",0
"A new method for the rapid and precise determination of chlorogenic acid in green and roasted coffee is based upon the absorption of chlorogenic acid at 324 millimicrons. The chlorogenic acid is extracted from flaked coffee samples with water, and for green coffee the ultraviolet absorption is measured directly on the extract. For roasted coffee, the absorption is measured on the extract before and after precipitation of the chlorogenic acid with basic lead acetate. The Slotta and Neisser iodometric oxidation method for chlorogenic acid has …",1
"This study aims to explore the observable distribution of serum uric acid levels in healthy adults residing in China's coastal areas and to assess the suitability of current reference intervals. The study incorporated 20,786 participants. The overall uric acid level displayed a skewed distribution, leading to the division of subjects into six groups based on gender and age. The analysis was conducted to comprehend the distribution of UA in various groups and seasons, establish and validate the reference intervals for the surface healthy population in this region, and analyze the abnormality rates using different reference intervals. Statistically significant differences were observed between the uric acid levels of males and females across all age groups (ALL p < 0.05). Furthermore, there were statistical differences in uric acid levels among different age groups for both genders (H = 69.593 and 326.348, all p < 0.001). The overall reference interval was determined as 238 - 488 µmol/L for males and 155 - 364 µmol/L for females, based on the 95% confidence interval (P2.5 - P97.5). The established reference intervals, grounded on gender and age group, were validated, showing statistically significant disparities in UA levels among groups. The abnormality rate in males decreased by 56.90% following the adjustment of the reference interval. The study revealed that UA levels at all ages exhibited varying degrees of ""right shift"". Additionally, the low-value population should not be overlooked in the clinical evaluation of UA test results. Setting a reasonable reference interval and clinical decision level is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy affecting children in Zimbabwe and 6-mercaptopurine is frequently used as part of its treatment. However, 6-mercaptopurine is associated with side-effects such as severe neutropenia (a condition where you have a low number of white blood cells called neutrophils in your blood), with increased risk observed in patients carrying variants in genes involved in the metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the frequency of polymorphisms in specific genes as well as their association with drug intolerance. A total of 41 patients on ALL treatment were studied. Review of treatment records was done to determine the cumulative 6-mercaptopurine dose and calculate dose intensity. Genotyping (to determine the versions of a gene a patient carries) for",0
"The integration of machine learning (ML) in predicting asthma-related outcomes in children presents a novel approach in pediatric health care. This scoping review aims to analyze studies published since 2019, focusing on ML algorithms, their applications, and predictive performances. We searched Ovid MEDLINE ALL and Embase on Ovid, the Cochrane Library (Wiley), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Web of Science (core collection). The search covered the period from January 1, 2019, to July 18, 2023. Studies applying ML models in predicting asthma-related outcomes in children aged <18 years were included. Covidence was used for citation management, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. From 1231 initial articles, 15 met our inclusion criteria. The sample size ranged from 74 to 87,413 patients. Most studies used multiple ML techniques, with logistic regression (n=7, 47%) and random forests (n=6, 40%) being the most common. Key outcomes included predicting asthma exacerbations, classifying asthma phenotypes, predicting asthma diagnoses, and identifying potential risk factors. For predicting exacerbations, recurrent neural networks and XGBoost showed high performance, with XGBoost achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76. In classifying asthma phenotypes, support vector machines were highly effective, achieving an AUROC of 0.79. For diagnosis prediction, artificial neural networks outperformed logistic regression, with an AUROC of 0.63. To identify risk factors focused on symptom severity and lung function, random forests achieved an AUROC of 0.88. Sound-based studies distinguished wheezing from nonwheezing and asthmatic from normal coughs. The risk of bias assessment revealed that most studies (n=8, 53%) exhibited low to moderate risk, ensuring a reasonable level of confidence in the findings. Common limitations across studies included data quality issues, sample size constraints, and interpretability concerns. This review highlights the diverse application of ML in predicting pediatric asthma outcomes, with each model offering unique strengths and challenges. Future research should address data quality, increase sample sizes, and enhance model interpretability to optimize ML utility in clinical settings for pediatric asthma management.",0
"The aim of this study was to identify catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) episodes, to determine the causative agents and antibiotic susceptibility profiles, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes of patients treated in the pediatric bone marrow transplant (BMT) unit between November 2019 and July 2022. Forty patients were included in the study. The median patient age was 7.5 years (range: 1.5 to 19.9 y) and the most common underlying disease was ALL (77.5%). CRBSI was found to be significantly higher in haploidentic donors ( P <0.001). When CRBSI was confirmed, 65% of the patients were neutropenic with a median duration of 17.5 days (range: 3 to 150). It was found that the mean time to CVC infection was 22 days (range: 5 to 118). As a result of multivariate logistic analysis (OR: 1.038 [95% CI: 1.007-1.070], P =0.018) of the time of infection of the catheter and mortality, it was determined that the mortality rate increased as the duration of the catheter remained. CRBSI was detected in 41.2% of transplanted patients and the overall mortality rate attributed to this complication was 10%. Among the patients, 22 (55%) were colonized before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and Gram-negative agents (n=15, 68%) mostly accounted for colonization. Gram-negative pathogens (60%) were found to be statistically significantly more common in CRBSI ( P <0.01). The most common causative agent was K. pneumoniae (n=13, 32.5%). Of the Gram-negative isolates (n=24), 17 (70.8%) were multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). A fluoroquinolone (80%) was used for antibiotic prophylaxis. Among patients with CRBSI, 65% had a fluoroquinolone-resistant isolate. We found a high rate of quinolone resistance among CRBSI isolates after the use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis at our unit.",0
"The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of genotype, tissue type and cold storage on the bioactive compounds content and on the antiradical activity (AA) of different apple cultivars (Golden cl. B, Fuji cl. Kiku8, Braeburn cl. Hillwell). The content of analysed phyto-compounds depended on the clone, on the part of fruit, and to a minor extent, on the storage. For EC(50) data, the cultivar represented the main source of variation and the interaction with the type of tissue, was significant. The AA of apples, measured by means of the DPPH test, was highly correlated to the flavan-3-ols content, which represents a good predictor of the apple antiradical power. The new Braeburn's clone, the Hillwell, had the worst AA related to a minor phyto-chemical content. Also, its phenolic content was dramatically reduced after cold storage (flesh: -50%; peels: -20%; p<0.05). Obtained results underlined the key role of the genotype on the content of the nutraceutical power of apples, which is important to improve their quality and consumption benefits, suggesting to the breeders to pay more attention to the potential healthy compounds in the development of new hybrids.",1
" Four Spanish raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) cultivars, Autumn Bliss, Heritage, Rubi, and Ceva, were studied in order to determine, qualitatively and quantitatively, both anthocyanins and vitamin C composition, owing to their significance as dietary compounds with antioxidant activity and also to the relation with color quality. Raspberry anthocyanin composition, determined by HPLC and GC-MS, was characteristic to each cultivar. The higher anthocyanin content expressed as cyanidin-3-glucoside was found in the late cultivars, Rubi (96.08 mg/100 g f.w.) and Ceva (122.88 mg/100 g f.w.). Three cultivars showed cyanidin-3-sophoroside (63.86–21.91 mg/100 g f.w.) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (25.12–14.00 mg/100 g f.w.) as the major pigments, while Autumn Bliss had a similar relative amount of cyanidin derivatives, cyanidin-3-rutinoside being the pigment in major concentration (10.53 mg/100 g f.w.). The vitamin C contents were determined by HPLC. The Rubi cultivar showed the highest amount of vitamin C (31.14 mg/100 g f.w.). The organic acids were determined by HPLC as fruit constituents related to color quality. Citric acid was the main non-volatile organic acid (90%) in all raspberry cultivars and the Rubi cultivar showed the highest total non-volatile organic acids content (2003 mg/100 g f.w.). Hunter color CIE values were also determined, showing that Rubi was the reddest raspberry cultivar.",1

"Quercetin is a typical flavonoid present mostly as glycosides in plant foods; it has attracted much attention for its potential beneficial effects in disease prevention. In this study, we examined human volunteers after the short-term ingestion of onion, a vegetable rich in quercetin glucosides. The subjects were served diets containing onion slices (quercetin equivalent: 67.6-93.6 mg/day) with meals for 1 wk. Quercetin was only found in glucuronidase-sulfatase-treated plasma, and its concentration after 10 h of fasting increased from 0.04 +/- 0.04 microM before the trial to 0.63 +/- 0.72 microM after the 1-wk trial. The quercetin content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after glucuronidase-sulfatase treatment corresponded to <1% of the alpha-tocopherol content. Human LDL isolated from the plasma after the trial showed little improvement of its resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation. It is therefore concluded that conjugated metabolites of quercetin accumulate exclusively in human blood plasma in the concentration range of 10(-7) approximately 10(-6) M after the short-term ingestion of vegetables rich in quercetin glucosides, although these metabolites are hardly incorporated into plasma LDL.",1
"Little is known about DNMT3A expression and its prognostic significance in childhood B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We determined DNMT3A mRNA expression in 102 children with B-ALL. Correlations with relapse-free survival (RFS) and common clinical characteristics were analyzed. DNMT3A was stably knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology in Reh and 697 B-ALL cell lines. Cell proliferation activity after treated with daunorubicin (DNR) was determined by CCK8 assay in DNMT3A KO Reh and 697 cell lines. DNMT3A expression in B-ALL patients who were in continuous complete remission (CCR) was higher than in those who got relapse (P = 0.0111). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed prognostic significance of DNMT3A expression (P = 0.003). Low expression of DNMT3A (≤ 0.197) was significantly correlated with poor RFS (P < 0.001) in children with B-ALL. Knock-out of DNMT3A in Reh and 697 cell lines significantly increased IC50 of DNR (P = 0.0201 and 0.0022 respectively), indicating elevated resistance to DNR. Low expression of DNMT3A associates with poor prognosis in children with B-ALL. Knock-out of DNMT3A confers resistance to DNR on leukemic cells.",0
"To explore whether Ph SUP-B15 cells were treated with different concentrations of imatinib or AEW541. Cell proliferation was assayed by Deep Blue, and apoptotic cells were determined by Annexin V/7-AAD staining. Apoptotic rate was measured by flow cytometry after co-treatment of imatinib and AEW541. Western blot was used to evaluate ABL downstream signals, including the phosphorylation of STAT5, ERK1/2, and AKT, as well as to detect cleaved caspase-3 and PARP1, the molecular signatures of apoptosis. Furthermore, an inhibitor of STAT5 or MEK-ERK1/2 was used to confirm the key mechanism of the combination of imatinib and AEW541 induced SUP-B15 cell apoptosis. Imatinib monotherapy effectively suppressed the proliferation of SUP-B15 cells, but did not induce significant increase of apoptotic rate, leading to occurrence of tolerant status. AEW541 monotherapy did not dramatically affect the proliferation and apoptosis of SUP-B15 cells, but significantly increased apoptotic rate of SUP-B15 cells and cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP1 when combined with imatinib simultaneously. A combination of imatinib and AEW541 reduced STAT5 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as compared with imatinib monotherapy in SUP-B15 cells, but had no impact on AKT phosphorylation.Apoptosis could be induced by STAT5 inhibitor AC-4-130, but not by MEK-ERK1/2 inhibitor trametinib in SUP-B15 cells. SUP-B15 cells treated with imatinib can establish drug tolerance. IGF1-R inhibitor AEW541 can further reduce STAT5 activation, thereby boosting the effect of apoptotic induction of imatinib on SUP-B15 cells. This research may provide a new idear to overcome imatinib tolerance. IGF1-R抑制剂AEW541对伊马替尼杀伤SUP-B15细胞的增效作用. 探讨伊马替尼处理Ph 使用不同浓度伊马替尼或AEW541处理SUP-B15细胞，Deep Blue试剂测定细胞增殖，Annexin V/7-AAD测定细胞凋亡；AEW541和伊马替尼联合处理SUP-B15细胞后流式细胞术测定细胞凋亡率，Western blot测定凋亡相关标志caspase-3和PARP1切割以及ABL下游信号STAT5、ERK1/2和AKT的磷酸化；STAT5和MEK-ERK1/2抑制剂进一步确认伊马替尼联合AEW541诱导SUP-B15细胞凋亡的关键机制。. 伊马替尼单药处理能有效抑制SUP-B15细胞增殖，但没有显著增加SUP-B15细胞的凋亡率从而出现耐受状态；AEW541单药对SUP-B15细胞增殖与凋亡没有显著影响，但与伊马替尼合用时能显著增加SUP-B15细胞凋亡率及caspase-3和PARP1的切割；AEW541与伊马替尼联合处理SUP-B15较伊马替尼单药STAT5和ERK1/2磷酸化水平更低而对AKT磷酸化水平无明显影响；STAT5抑制剂AC-4-130而非MEK-ERK1/2抑制剂曲美替尼能诱导SUP-B15细胞凋亡。. SUP-B15细胞株可对伊马替尼呈现药物耐受，IGF1-R抑制剂AEW541可进一步降低STAT5的活化，继而增强伊马替尼对SUP-B15细胞的凋亡诱导作用，这为打破耐受提供新思路。.",0
"The dysregulation of alternative splicing (AS) is increasingly recognized as a pivotal player in the pathogenesis, progression, and treatment resistance of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Despite its significance, the clinical implications of AS events in B-ALL remain largely unexplored. This study developed a prognostic model based on 18 AS events (18-AS), derived from a meticulous integration of bioinformatics methodologies and advanced machine learning algorithms. The 18-AS signature observed in B-ALL distinctly categorized patients into different groups with significant differences in immune infiltration, V(D)J rearrangement, drug sensitivity, and immunotherapy outcomes. Patients classified within the high 18-AS group exhibited lower immune infiltration scores, poorer chemo- and immune-therapy responses, and worse overall survival, underscoring the model's potential in refining therapeutic strategies. To validate the clinical applicability of the 18-AS, we established an SF-AS regulatory network and identified candidate drugs. More importantly, we conducted in vitro cell proliferation assays to confirm our analysis, demonstrating that the High-18AS cell line (SUP-B15) exhibited significantly enhanced sensitivity to Dasatinib, Dovitinib, and Midostaurin compared to the Low-18AS cell line (REH). These findings reveal AS events as novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, advancing personalized treatment strategies in B-ALL management.",0
"Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos extracts.",1
"The polyphenolics in aqueous extracts of Marion (Rubus sp. hyb) and Evergreen (Rubus laciniatus) blackberries and blackberry seeds were isolated by solid-phase extraction using C18 cartridges and polyamide mini-column chromatography, and characterized using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatogra-phy/diode array spectral techniques. Flavonols (primarily quercetin glycosides) were the major phenolics in berries, whereas procyanidins (catechin and epicatechin) and ellagic acid derivatives predominated in seeds. No flavonols were found in seeds. Evergreen berries contained higher level of epicatechin, ellagic acid derivatives, and flavonols than Marion berries, whereas Marion berries and seeds were higher in anthocyanins, total phenolics, and antioxidant properties as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power.",1
"Changes of ascorbic acid (AA), flavanone glycosides (FGs), phenolic acids and antioxidant capacity which was expressed as ascorbic acid equivalent capacity (AEAC) of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) determined by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and radical scavenging capacity (RSC) determined by 2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, of mandarin orange segments during can processing were investigated. The effects of four key processing procedures were studied, namely blanching, HCl, alkaline and canning treatment. As a result, after canning, the total FGs content of mandarin segments decreased from 502.39mg/kg to 254.27mg/kg, and the total phenolic acids from 57.51mg/kg to 44.20mg/kg. The similar decreasing tendency was also true to the AA content of mandarin segments (from 251.87mg/kg to 186.98mg/kg), TAC (from 664.48mg/kg to 391.95mg/kg), and inhibition of DPPH radical (from 34.85% to 27.31%). To be concluded, small proportions of phenolic acids and AA were lost, and the loss of FGs and TAC was about fifty percent. However, in view of the considerable part of phenolic compounds and AA existing in the syrup portion; the loss was not as large as that. Therefore, we suggested that the majority of AA, phenolic compounds (FGs and phenolic acids) and antioxidant capacity of mandarin segments were retained after can processing, and mandarin cans could serve as a substitute when fresh mandarin fruits are not available.",1
"The contribution of the chemical composition to the flavor of cocoa liquor from an Ecuadorian selfed population of clone EET 95 was investigated. Polyphenols, purine alkaloids, organic acids, and sugars were quantified, and the key sensory characteristics of cocoa were scored by a trained panel. Despite the short bean fermentation (2 days) commonly used for Arriba cocoa, acetic acid content was closely correlated to liquor pH, demonstrating its essential role in cocoa liquor acidification. Polyphenols were positively correlated to astringency, bitterness, and the green note and negatively correlated to the fruity character. Alkaloid and polyphenol levels fluctuated significantly within the selfed progeny and tended to be lower than those of the heterozygous clone EET 95 (inbreeding effect). These results support the idea that polyphenols might be essential to the overall perception of cocoa liquor characteristics and indicate that the composition and the sensory quality of cocoa liquor are the result of both a genotypic contribution and the conditions of fermentation and roasting.",1
"Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting genes in the PI3K/Akt pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, the impact of genetic variants in these miRNAs on ALL susceptibility has not been extensively explored in the Chinese population. To address this gap, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the association between genetic variants in five PI3K/AKT pathway-related miRNAs (miR-149, miR-126, miR-492, miR-612, and miR-423) and childhood ALL susceptibility in the Chinese population. Additionally, we investigated the effects of the rs2292832 mutation on ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis. Our analyses revealed that the miR-149 rs2292832 mutant heterozygous CT genotype was more frequent in the control group than in the ALL cases, indicating a protective effect against ALL (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63-0.97, p = .024). Stratification analyses further revealed that the miR-149 rs2292832 CC genotype was associated with an increased risk of childhood ALL in subgroups of older children, females, those with parents who never smoked or drank alcohol, those living in painted houses, those with B-ALL, and those with high-risk ALL. Finally, we observed that the rs2292832 mutation inhibited ALL cell proliferation and induced apoptosis (p = .001), providing a potential mechanism by which this genetic variant may influence ALL susceptibility. Our study highlights the significant association between the miR-149 rs2292832 genetic variant and childhood ALL susceptibility in the Chinese population. These findings expand our understanding of the complex genetic landscape underlying ALL and have implications for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies.",0
"Rearrangements of the MLL (KMT2A) locus are associated with aggressive leukaemia of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, that present profound therapeutic challenges in pediatric and adult patient populations. MLL-fusion genes resulting from these rearrangements function as driving oncogenes and have been the focus of research aimed at understanding mechanisms underlying their leukemogenic activity and revealing novel therapeutic opportunities. Inspired by the paradigm of depleting the PML-RARA fusion protein in acute promyelocytic leukemia using all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, we conducted a screen to identify FDA-approved drugs capable of depleting MLL-fusion protein expression in leukemia cells. Previously, we reported potent anti-leukemia effects of disulfiram (DSF), identified through this screen. In the present study, we demonstrate that another hit compound, niclosamide (NSM), is also able to deplete MLL-fusion proteins derived from a range of different MLL-fusion genes in both acute myeloid (AML) and acute lymphoid (ALL) leukemias. Loss of MLL-fusion protein appeared to result from inhibition of global protein translation by NSM. Importantly, combination of DSF with NSM enhanced MLL-fusion protein depletion. This led to more profound inhibition of downstream transcriptional leukemogenic programs regulated by MLL-fusion proteins and more effective killing of both MLL-rearranged AML and ALL cells. In contrast, DSF/NSM drug combination had little impact on normal hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation. This study demonstrates that two FDA-approved drugs with excellent safety profiles can be combined to increase the efficacy of MLL-fusion protein depletion and elimination of MLL-rearranged leukaemia.",0
"The effects of conventional clarification and ultrafiltration techniques on the phenolic composition of apple juice was studied. Since the health benefit of fruits and fruit juices have been ascribed, in part, to the phenolic antioxidants, it is very important to know what the effects of processing steps are on the level of phenolic compounds in fruit juices. The total losses of phenolic compounds were determined to be 28% and 7% during conventional clarification using gelatin and bentonite, and ultrafiltration, respectively. A total of 14 phenolic compounds were identified in apple juice prepared from Golden Delicious apples. The phenolic compounds were found to be based mainly on hydroxycinnamic acids (∼ 50% of total phenolics) and chlorogenic acid was found to be the major phenolic compound with its concentration as high as 465.45 mg 1−1 in raw apple juice.",1
"Progress in understanding the effects of dietary soy isoflavones on chronic disease prevention in the Hong Kong Chinese population has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive soy isoflavone database. In this study, we determined the concentrations and distribution of isoflavones in 47 foods included in a soy food frequency questionnaire by reverse-phase HPLC. Results indicated that most soy products contained isoflavones ranging from 1 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight (bean strip noodle and egg bean curd) to 80 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight (oyster sauce soybean and sweet bean curd sheet). Among our food groups, mean isoflavone concentrations were lowest in the soy milk group (9.99 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight) and highest in the bean curd skin group (40 mg of aglucon equivalents/100 g of wet weight). The conjugation patterns of isoflavones varied within and between food groups as influenced by the types of soybeans and the processing or cooking techniques used. The isoflavone concentrations reported herein will be useful for ascertaining the relationship between exposure to dietary soy isoflavones and health effects in the Chinese population.",1
"(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant and most biologically active polyphenolic compound in tea, has been proposed to have many health beneficial effects. The metabolic fate of EGCG, however, is not well understood. In the present study, we identified a novel EGCG metabolite, 7-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside, in a mouse urine sample using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The structure of this metabolite was confirmed by analyzing the MSn (n = 1-4) spectra as well as comparing the MS/MS spectra of its product ions with those from EGCG and EGCG-4''-O-beta-D-glucupyranoside standards. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of a glucoside metabolite of EGCG in mammals. Our results indicate that glucosidation represents a novel pathway in the metabolism of EGCG in mice.",1
"Concentrations of the major flavonoids and phenolic acids in the peel and cortex of fruit of eight commercial apple cultivars were determined by HPLC. The multivariate statistical technique of correspondence analysis was applied to the polyphenol profiles to describe distinctive groups of cultivars and of polyphenols, and their joint correspondences. Cultural and growing conditions had a limited effect on the polyphenol profiles of the cortex and peel. Chlorogenic acid was the principal polyphenol in the cortex with the lowest levels being in Red Delicious and the highest in Jerseymac, which were compensated by changes in phlorizin. Cortland had low levels of chlorogenic acid and Gravenstein had high levels, but these were offset by the levels of catechins. The quercetin, rhamnoside, was the principal phenolic compound for the peel data with low levels in Red Delicious, Cortland, Spartan and Jerseymac and high levels in Golden Delicious, Gravenstein and Northern Spy. Levels of chlorogenic acid, offset by levels of phlorizin and catechins, distinguished between Red Delicious and Cortland. Rutin was important in distinguishing between Jerseymac and Spartan.",1
"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent childhood malignancy characterized by abnormal lymphoid cell proliferation. Despite treatment advancements, relapse remains problematic, necessitating improved prognostic markers. NOTCH1 mutations, particularly in T-cell ALL (T-ALL), have been implicated in ALL pathogenesis. We examined the correlation between NOTCH1 mutations and clinical characteristics in 185 Indian pediatric ALL patients. NOTCH1 mutations were detected using PCR and sequencing, with subsequent analysis of clinical parameters and outcomes. Twenty-four cases exhibited NOTCH1 mutations, primarily in the PEST domain, with a higher frequency in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) than in T-ALL. Specific clinical features, including elevated WBC counts and LDH levels, were associated with NOTCH1 mutations. Survival analysis suggested potential prognostic implications of NOTCH1 mutations in B-ALL but not in T-ALL. Integrating NOTCH1 mutation status with minimal residual disease levels post-induction therapy may aid in identifying high-risk patients. Our findings underscore the heterogeneous nature of ALL and advocate for personalized therapy guided by molecular markers. Further research is essential to elucidate the role of NOTCH1 mutations in ALL prognosis and treatment response.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fatal blood disorder characterized by the excessive proliferation of immature white blood cells, originating in the bone marrow. An effective prognosis and treatment of ALL calls for its accurate and timely detection. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in digital pathology. However, they face challenges in classifying different subtypes of leukemia due to their subtle morphological differences. This study proposes an improved pipeline for binary detection and sub-type classification of ALL from blood smear images. At first, a customized, 88 layers deep CNN is proposed and trained using transfer learning along with GoogleNet CNN to create an ensemble of features. Furthermore, this study models the feature selection problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposes a memetic version of binary whale optimization algorithm, incorporating Differential Evolution-based local search method to enhance the exploration and exploitation of feature search space. The proposed approach is validated using publicly available standard datasets containing peripheral blood smear images of various classes of ALL. An overall best average accuracy of 99.15% is achieved for binary classification of ALL with an 85% decrease in the feature vector, together with 99% precision and 98.8% sensitivity. For B-ALL sub-type classification, the best accuracy of 98.69% is attained with 98.7% precision and 99.57% specificity. The proposed methodology shows better performance metrics as compared with several existing studies.",0
"Preclinical studies suggest that Bcl-2 inhibition with venetoclax has antileukemic activity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and may synergize with conventional chemotherapy. We designed a phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-intensity chemotherapy in combination with venetoclax in adults with relapsed or refractory ALL. Patients received the mini-hyper-CVD regimen (dose-attenuated hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine) in combination with venetoclax (200 mg or 400 mg daily) on days 1 to 14 in cycle 1 and on days 1 to 7 in consolidation cycles. Twenty-two patients were treated. The median number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 1-6). Thirteen patients (59%) had undergone prior allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT), and 7 of 18 patients (39%) with B-cell ALL had previously received both inotuzumab ozogamicin and blinatumomab. The recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax in the combination regimen was 400 mg daily. The composite complete remission (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) rate was 57% (CR, 43%; CRi, 14%), and 45% of responders achieved measurable residual disease negativity by multiparameter flow cytometry. Four patients proceeded to allo-SCT. The median duration of response was 6.3 months. The median overall survival was 7.1 months, and the 1-year overall survival rate was 29%. The most common grade ≥3 nonhematologic adverse events were infection in 17 patients (77%) and febrile neutropenia in 4 patients (18%). Overall, the combination of mini-hyper-CVD plus venetoclax was active in heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory ALL. Further development of venetoclax-based combinations in ALL is warranted. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03808610.",0

"Several studies have demonstrated that resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene), a compound belonging to the phytoalexin family, involved in grape disease resistance, occurs in wines. It has been demonstrated that this compound might have cardioprotective and chemoprotective activities. I report here the presence of this compound in Tunisian wine. Analysis of resveratrol in wine was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography.",1
"The use of inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO), a conjugated anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody, is becoming a promising frontline treatment for older patients with ALL. EWALL-INO is an open-label prospective multicenter phase II trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03249870). Patients age 55 years and older with newly diagnosed CD22 Between December 2017 and March 2022, 131 patients (median age 68 years) were included. Three patients died during induction 1 (n = 130), two from multiple organ failure and one from hemorrhage, and none during induction 2 (n = 120). After induction 2, 90% of the patients achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) and 80% had measurable residual disease (MRD2) <10 Our results support InO's use in first-line regimens for older patients with CD22",0
"Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan precursors, but now several new precursors have been identified, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database including all four major enterolignan precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-three solid foods and twenty-six beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans was flaxseed (301,129 microg/100 g), which contained mainly secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29,331 microg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg/100 g. However, many vegetables and fruits had similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of lignans (185-2321 microg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91 microg/100 ml (red wine). Only four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol. Thus, available databases largely underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods.",1
"A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of ethyl gallate, a pharmacologically active constituent isolated from Lagerstroemia speciosa (Linn.) Pers. This method was used to examine the pharmacokinetics of ethyl gallate and its major metabolite gallic acid in rat plasma using propyl gallate as an internal standard. After precipitation of the plasma proteins with acetonitrile, the analytes were separated on a Zorbax SB-C(18) column (3.5 microm, 2.1 x 50 mm) with an isocratic mobile phase consisted of methanol-acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate (10 : 25 : 65, v/v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The Agilent G6410A triple quadrupole LC/MS system was operated under the multiple-reaction monitoring mode using the electrospray ionization technique in negative mode. The lower limits of quantification of gallic acid and ethyl gallate of the method were 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of the assay were less than 8.0%. This method has been applied successfully to a pharmacokinetic study involving the intragastric administration of ethyl gallate to rats.",1
"Blinatumomab has remarkable efficacy in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) or measurable residual disease (MRD)-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In many patients, blinatumomab treatment is followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, the influence of blinatumomab on HSCT outcomes in children and young adults (YA) remains to be fully elucidated. We conducted a single-center, retrospective analysis of patients given blinatumomab as last treatment before HSCT. Seventy-eight pediatric and YA patients were evaluated. With a median follow- up of 23.23 months, the 2-year disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) probability were 72.2% and 89.2%, respectively, with a 2-year cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) of 2.6%. A trend toward improved 2-year DFS, but not OS, was noted in patients transplanted in first complete remission (CR1) (92.9%) compared to those in second or greater remission (CR2/3) (68.5%; P=0.18) due to a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (0% vs. 29.9%; P=0.05). Among CR2/3 patients, those receiving the sequential combination of inotuzumab and blinatumomab had a significantly lower cumulative incidence of relapse as compared to those who did not receive inotuzumab (9.5% vs. 40.4%; P=0.023). Relapse after HSCT occurred in 16 patients, all exhibiting CD19-positive blasts; ten of them received anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T) therapy and two inotuzumab as salvage therapy, leading to a 2-year post-relapse OS of 52.7%. Our results indicate that HSCT following blinatumomab in children and YA with B-ALL is highly effective, being associated with low NRM and not affecting the efficacy of subsequent salvage immunotherapies, including CAR T cells.",0
"Asparaginase is a critical component of curative therapy for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (LLy). Pegaspargase (PEG) increased the duration of asparagine depletion and lowered the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) compared with native asparaginase. When a second pegylated product, Calasparagase pegol-mknl (Cal-PEG) replaced PEG, we observed an increased incidence of HSR, defined as anaphylaxis or silent hypersensitivity. This led to a single center, retrospective review to determine the incidence of HSR in patients with ALL or LLy who received Cal-PEG or PEG. Electronic medical records of all patients who received at least two doses of Cal-PEG (December 2022-December 2023) or PEG (December 2019-December 2022) were reviewed. Overall, patients who received Cal-PEG had a significantly increased rate of asparaginase-related HSR compared with patients who received PEG. Twenty-one of 44 (48%) patients receiving Cal-PEG and 35 out of 154 (23%) of patients receiving PEG experienced Grade 3 or higher anaphylaxis, or silent hypersensitivity (p = 0.001). After 2:1 matching based on propensity scoring for confounding variables, patients who received Cal-PEG continued to have a statistically significantly higher rates of HSR, with HSR occurring in 21 out of 44 (48%) and 26 out of 88 (30%) patients receiving Cal-PEG and PEG, respectively (p = 0.04). The current administration of Cal-PEG in large cooperative group trials will allow for a postmarketing exploration of the true risk of HSR and associated patient-specific risk factors.",0
"To evaluate hematologist-oncologists' preferences for frontline treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) + chemotherapy. An online discrete choice experiment was conducted among US-based hematologist-oncologists. Participants viewed profiles of hypothetical TKI + chemotherapy treatments with varied levels of benefit and risks (minimal residual disease-negative complete remission [MRD-negative CR], arterial occlusive events, grade 3-4 hepatotoxicity, grade 3-4 hematotoxicity) and chose their recommended treatment for five patient profiles: ""less-complex"" baseline; age ≥ 65; ECOG score 3; diabetes; hypertension. Data were analyzed using mixed multinomial logit models. 121 hematologist-oncologists participated. Increasing MRD-negative CR was most important to hematologist-oncologists, driving 65%-87% of decision-making across patient profiles. Relative importance of benefits/risks varied by patient profile. Pooled across patient profiles, hepatotoxicity was the most concerning risk, driving 14% of decision-making. Based on PhALLCON data and elicited preferences, hematologist-oncologists were predicted to select the profile of ponatinib + chemotherapy over imatinib + chemotherapy for all included patient profiles. Predicted probabilities of choosing ponatinib over imatinib ranged from 87%-98% across patient profiles. Hematologist-oncologists prioritized achieving MRD-negative CR when recommending frontline treatments for Ph+ ALL, accepting some risks if offset by meaningful improvement in MRD-negative CR. This article looks at what matters the most to doctors when they choose between different treatments for a patient with a type of leukemia called Ph+ ALL. It focuses on how doctors weigh the benefits (how well the treatment works) against the risks (side effects) of different treatments. In this study, doctors in the US completed an online survey with 12 questions. In each question, they were shown two treatment options. The two options had different chances of getting rid of the cancer cells and different chances that patients would experience certain side effects, including heart attack/stroke, severe liver damage, and severe blood cell damage. Doctors chose which treatment they would recommend for an otherwise healthy patient, and then for an older patient, a patient with severe difficulty doing everyday activities, a patient with diabetes, and a patient with high blood pressure. One hundred twenty-one doctors completed the survey. They cared most about how well a treatment improves the chance of getting rid of cancer cells. Among the risks, doctors were most concerned with liver damage. Doctors had slightly different concerns for different patients. For each type of patient, doctors in the study were more likely to recommend the drug ponatinib over imatinib, since ponatinib has a higher chance of getting rid of cancer cells. Overall, these results show that doctors mostly decide on a treatment for patients with Ph+ ALL based on how well the treatment gets rid of cancer cells. They would likely recommend ponatinib over imatinib for many types of patients.",0
"Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) deficiency is strongly associated with thiopurine-induced myelosuppression. Currently, testing for NUDT15 deficiency is based on the genotyping of the most frequent and clinically characterized no-function variants, that is, *2, *3 and *9. The Hispanic/Latino-predominant variant NUDT15 *4 (p.R139H) is classified as ""uncertain function"" by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, because of insufficient data to ascertain its clinical actionability. In this study, we evaluated the association of NUDT15 *4 with mercaptopurine (6-MP) tolerance in a retrospective cohort of 1,399 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of diverse ancestries. All patients were wildtype for thiopurine methyltransferase gene. Patients were treated with 6-MP in the context of ALL frontline clinical trials. The tolerated dose of 6-MP was used to assess drug toxicity during the maintenance phase of ALL therapy. Patients with NUDT15 *1/*4 (n = 16, all of whom self-identified as Hispanic/Latino) tolerated a significantly lower dose of 6-MP than did those with NUDT15 *1/*1: median [interquartile range] of 39.0 [21.2-52.8] mg/m",0
"The purpose of the work was to investigate the effect of the maturation process of the olive fruit on the phenolic fraction of drupes and oils from Arbequina, Farga, and Morrut cultivars. The level in the phenolic content of olive drupes declines rapidly during the black maturation phase. A general decreasing trend was observed too in the phenolic content of olive oils during the ripening process in the three varieties studied. Important differences in the high-performance liquid chromatography profile between varieties were observed. These included the presence of very low amounts of lignans in olive oils proceeding from the Morrut cultivar, and the presence of three peaks after elution of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA in the Farga and Morrut cultivars, which could be used as differentiating parameters. Sensory profile differences were observed between olive cultivars and due to the ripening process.",1
"Quantitative estimates of conjugated flavonoid content were obtained by using HPLC to analyze the level of free flavonoids present in acid-hydrolyzed extracts from commercial fruits and vegetables. Cherry tomatoes contained 17−203 μg of quercetin g-1 fresh weight compared to 2.2−11 μg g-1 detected in normal-sized Scottish, Spanish, and Dutch beef tomatoes. The quercetin levels in onions ranged from 185 to 634 μg of quercetin g-1 fresh weight. “Round” lettuce contained 11 μg of quercetin g-1 fresh weight compared to 911 μg g-1 in the outer leaves and 450 mg g-1 in the inner leaves of “Lollo Rosso” lettuce. The conjugated flavonoid content of celery was very variable, ranging from undetectable to 40 μg of luteolin and 191 μg of apigenin g-1 fresh weight. Cooking lowered the quercetin content of both tomatoes and onions with greater reductions being detected following microwaving and boiling than after frying.",1
"While the genomics era has allowed remarkable advances in understanding the mechanisms driving the biology and pathogenesis of numerous blood cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), metabolic studies are still lagging, especially regarding how the metabolism differs between healthy and diseased individuals. T-cell ALL (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological neoplasm deriving from the malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors characterized by frequent NOTCH1 pathway activation. The aim of our study was to characterize tumor and plasma metabolomes during T-ALL development using a NOTCH1-induced murine T-ALL model (ΔE-NOTCH1). In tissue, we found a significant metabolic shift with leukemia development, as metabolites linked to glycolysis (lactic acid) and Tricarboxylic acid cycle replenishment (succinic and malic acids) were elevated in NOTCH1 tumors, while metabolites associated with lipid oxidation (e.g., carnitine) as well as purine and pyrimidine metabolism were elevated in normal thymic tissue. Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, as well as valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis were enriched pathways in tumor tissue. Phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism was highly enriched in plasma from leukemia-bearing mice compared to healthy mice. Further, we identified a metabolic signature consisting of glycine, alanine, proline, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and glutamic acid as potential biomarkers for leukemia progression in plasma. Hopefully, the metabolic differences detected in our leukemia model will apply to humans and contribute to the development of metabolism-oriented therapeutic approaches.",0
"A polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was developed as a potential approach to increase intake of dietary polyphenols. Analysis of the beverage by HPLC with PDA, fluorescence, and MS detection facilitated the identification/partial identification of 40 flavonoids and related phenolic compounds. The main constituents were (-)-epigallocatechin and other green tea flavan-3-ols, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside, gallic acid, hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and procyanidins, with trace levels of several flavonols and purple grape juice anthocyanins also being present. Healthy human subjects (n = 10) consumed 350 mL of the P-R juice drink, after which plasma and urine samples were collected over a 0-24 h period. HPLC-MS analysis identified 13 metabolites in plasma and a further 20 in urine. Qualitatively, the profiles of the glucuronide, sulfated, and methylated metabolites were very similar to those detected in earlier investigations when the main components in the juice drink were consumed separately in feeding studies with coffee, green tea, orange juice, and apple cider.",1
"l-Asparaginase is a cornerstone of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy since lymphoblasts lack asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and rely on extracellular asparagine availability for survival. Resistance mechanisms are associated with increased ASNS expression in ALL. However, the association between ASNS and l-Asparaginase efficacy in solid tumors remains unclear, thus limiting clinical development. Interestingly, l-Asparaginase also has a glutaminase co-activity that is crucial in pancreatic cancer where KRAS mutations activate glutamine metabolism. By developing l-Asparaginase-resistant pancreatic cancer cells and using OMICS approaches, we identified glutamine synthetase (GS) as a marker of resistance to l-Asparaginase. GS is the only enzyme able to synthesize glutamine, and its expression also correlates with l-Asparaginase efficacy in 27 human cell lines from 11 cancer indications. Finally, we further demonstrated that GS inhibition prevents cancer cell adaptation to l-Asparaginase-induced glutamine starvation. These findings could pave the way to the development of promising drug combinations to overcome l-Asparaginase resistance.",0
"Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy. While the survival rate for childhood ALL exceeds 90% in high-income countries, the estimated survival in low-and middle-income countries ranges from 22-79%, depending on the region and local resources. This study retrospectively reviewed demographic, biological, and clinical parameters of children under 18 years of age with newly diagnosed ALL presenting between 2013-2017 across five pediatric centers in 4 countries in South America. Survival analyses were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Across the five centers, 752 patients were analyzed (Bolivia [N=9], Ecuador [N=221], Paraguay [N=197], Peru [N=325]) and 92.1% (n=690) patients were diagnosed with B-cell and 7.5% (n= 56) with T-cell ALL. The median age was 5.5 years old (IQR 7.29). At diagnosis, 47.8% of patients were categorized as standard and 51.9% as high risk per their institutional regimen. Advanced diagnostics availability varied between modalities. MRD was evaluated in 69.1% of patients; molecular testing was available for ETV6-RUNX, BCR-ABL1, TCF3-PBX1, and KMT2A-rearranged ALL in 75-81% of patients; however, karyotyping and evaluation for iAMP21 were only performed in 42-61% of patients. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement was evaluated at diagnosis in 57.3% (n=429) patients; of these, 93.7% (n=402) were CNS 1, 1.6% (n=7) were CNS 2, 0.7% (n=11) were CNS3, 1.9% (n=8) had cranial nerve palsy, and 2.1% (n=9) results unavailable. Chemotherapy delays >2 weeks were reported in 56.0% (n=421) patients during treatment. Delays were attributed to infection in 63.2% (n=265), drug-related toxicities in 47.3% (n=198), and resource constraints, including lack of bed availability in 23.2% (n=97) of patients. The 3-year Abandonment-sensitive EFS and OS were 61.0±1.9% and 67.2±1.8%, respectively. The 3-year EFS and OS were 71.0±1.8% and 79.6±1.7%, respectively. This work reveals opportunities to improve survival, including addressing severe infections, treatment interruptions, and modifications due to drug shortages. In 2018, healthcare professionals across South America established the Pediatric Oncology Latin America (POLA) group in collaboration with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. POLA collaborators developed an evidence-based, consensus-derived, adapted treatment guideline, informed by preliminary results of this evaluation, to serve as the new standard of care for pediatric ALL in participating institutions.",0
"A new flow-injection spectrophotometric method for the determination of tannins in tea and beer based on the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by tannins and the subsequent formation of the coloured complex Fe(II)-1,10-phenanthroline is proposed. The FIA set-up used is controlled by a personal computer running appropriate software for automatic sample injection and data acquisition and processing. The calibration curve obtained is linear between 0–30 mg litre−1 gallic acid and the relative standard deviation for a standard containing 10 mg litre−1 gallic acid is 0·7% (n = 10). The sample throughput achieved is 60 sample h−1. Unlike the batch method, on which it is based, the proposed method requires no sample pretreatment in order to avoid interferences; it only involves appropriate dilution of the samples, and so provides more reliable results in a substantially shorter time.",1
"The content of the potentially health-defensive and disease-preventive flavonoids quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, apigenin and luteolin of 31 vegetables were determined by RP- HPLC with UV detection. Vegetables were purchased at the local markets in Budapest at a period of their most frequent consumption. Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables were generally below 10 mg kg &1, except for onions (67&121.5 mg kg &1), lettuce (13.5&35.0 mg kg &1), dill (74.5 mg kg &1), broccoli (15.5 mg kg &1) and spinach (272.2 mg kg &1). Kaempferol was below 30 mg kg &1 except for parsnip (66.4 mg kg &1) and leek (45.8 mg kg &1). Myricetin could only be detected in lettuce, Swedish turnip, parsley and celery leaves, and dill. Detectable amount of luteolin was in radishes, some representatives of Brassica, sweet peppers, celery leaves and spinach while apigenin was only in Swedish turnip, celery root and celery leaves. These data provide a basis for the evaluation of the average daily intake of Hungarian population and for an epidemiological evaluation of health-promoting effects of flavonoids.",1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common hematological malignancy that occurs due to blockage of B-lymphocyte maturation at an early stage of development and differentiation. The Food and Drug Administration approved blinotumomab to manage relapsed/refractory ALL (R/R ALL). This review aimed to determine the comparative efficacy of blinatumomab in treating R/R ALL. Two reviewers searched 3 electronic databases, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and CENTRAL, for all relevant articles published until July 2024. All the articles that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Four hundred thirty-seven articles were found from the electronic search; however, only 21 articles met the inclusion criteria. A pooled analysis of the outcomes found that blinatumomab resulted in an improvement in both the OS (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.82; P =0.0003) and the DFS (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.80; P =0.001). Further analysis showed that the CR rate and MRD response of ALL patients to blinatumomab was 51.6% (95% CI: 48.5%, 54.6%; P =0.319) and 64.6% (95% CI: 53.4%, 74.3%; P =0.011), respectively. The safety analysis indicated that the incidence of serious AEs was comparable in patients receiving blinotumomab and those receiving standard chemotherapy (OR: 1.34; 95% CI; 0.91, 1.97; P =0.14). The findings show that blinatumomab is superior to standard chemotherapy in improving the OS and DFS of patients with R/R ALL. Furthermore, it has a more favorable safety profile, making it an effective alternative to conventional chemotherapy for managing R/R ALL.",0
"A semipreparative chromatographic method for the isolation of small amounts (10−20 μg) of dimeric and trimeric proanthocyanidins from barley is described. Concentrated extracts of barley were injected onto a high-performance gel filtration column (Superdex 75 HR), and were eluted with methanol. This procedure resolved the dimeric proanthocyanidins (prodelphinidin B3 and procyanidin B3), as well as the trimeric procyanidin C2 and three other trimeric prodelphinidins. The separated flavanoid peaks were collected and their contents were estimated by UV spectrophotometry, reaction with p-dimethylaminocinnamadehyde, and reversed phase HPLC with electrochemical detection. This method produced proanthocyanidins in sufficient amounts to calibrate a system for direct injection chromatographic analysis of beers and barley extracts. The method described may be optimized for the isolation of dimeric proanthocyanidins only, in which case the preparation can take as little as 3 h; alternatively, by extending the chromatographic separation to 9 h, the four major trimeric proanthocyanidins of barley can be recovered also in a chromatographically pure state.",1
"The resveratrol monomers (trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol) have been previously identified and quantified in red wines. Here, the levels of these compounds in Spanish white and rosé wines are described. For white wines, a concentration step was needed to quantify the four resveratrol isomers. The recovery and reproducibility of this procedure were very good. These white wines had levels between 0.051 and 1.801 mg/L. Rosé wines had an average level of 2.15 mg/L, in between those of red and white wines.",1
"Total-body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen is preferred in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We retrospectively evaluated allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) outcomes of 86 adult ALL patients in complete remission (CR) who received TBI-containing reduced intensity (RIC) (Flu/Mel/TBI = 31) and myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (VP16/TBI = 47; CY/TBI = 8) between January 2005 and December 2019. All patients received peripheral blood allografts. Patients in the RIC group were older than the MAC group (61 years old versus 36 years,",0
"ZNF384-fusion (Z-fusion) genes were recently identified in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and are frequent in Japanese adult patients. The frequency is about 20% in those with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. ZNF384 is a transcription factor and Z-fusion proteins have increased transcriptional activity; however, the detailed mechanisms of leukemogenesis of Z-fusion proteins have yet to be clarified. We established three transfectants of cell lines expressing different types of Z-fusion proteins, and analyzed their gene expression profile (GEP) by RNA-seq. We also analyzed the GEP of clinical ALL samples using our previous RNA-seq data of 323 Japanese ALL patients. We selected upregulated genes in both Z-fusion gene-expressing transfectants and Z-fusion gene-positive ALL samples, and investigated the binding of Z-fusion proteins to regulatory regions of the candidate genes by ChIP-qPCR. We selected six commonly upregulated genes. After the investigation by ChIP-qPCR, we finally identified CREB5 and RGS1 as direct and common target genes. RGS1 is an inhibitor of CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling that is required for the homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone marrow microenvironment and development of B cells. Consistent with this, Z-fusion gene transfectants showed impaired migration toward CXCL12. We identified CREB5 and RGS1 as direct and common transcriptional targets of Z-fusion proteins. The present results provide novel insight into the aberrant transcriptional regulation by Z-fusion proteins.",0
"The outcomes of Pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved dramatically whereas outcomes for ALL amongst adolescents and young adults (AYA) have lagged behind. The introduction of pediatric-like regimens to manage adult ALL has shown promising outcomes across several analyses. In this analysis, we aimed to retrospectively compare the differences in outcomes among patients aged 14-40 years with Philadelphia-negative ALL treated with a Hyper-CVAD protocol versus a modified pediatric protocol. A total of 103 patients were identified with 58 (56.3%) in the modified ABFM group and 45 (43.7%) in the hyper-CVAD group. The median duration of follow-up for the cohort was 39 months (range 1-93). There were significantly lower rates of MRD persistence after consolidation (10.3% vs. 26.7%, P = 0.031) and transplantation (15.5% vs. 46.6%, P < 0.001) in the modified ABFM group. 5-year OS rates (83.9% vs. 65.3%, P = 0.036) and DFS rates (67.4% vs. 44%, P = 0.014) were higher in the modified ABFM groups. The incidence of grade 3 and 4 hepatotoxicity (24.1% vs. 13.3%, P < 0.001) and osteonecrosis (20.6% vs. 2.2%, P = 0.005) were higher in the modified ABFM group. Our analysis demonstrates that the use of a pediatric modified ABFM protocol demonstrated superior outcomes compared to the hyper-CVAD regimen in the treatment of Philadelphia-negative ALL amongst AYA patients. However, the modified ABFM protocol was associated with an increased risk of certain toxicities including high grade liver toxicity and osteonecrosis.",0
"Previous studies have shown continuous improved overall survival (OS) up to 2015 for young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). However, recently several important advances have been made justifying a more contemporary analysis of outcomes in adult with ALL. In this nationwide population-based cohort study, we included patients above 18 years of age diagnosed with ALL between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2020. Patients were followed until December 31, 2022. By employing flexible parametric survival models, we quantified progress in OS using the key endpoint of 2-year age standardized OS for all patients and clinical subgroups of interest. This study includes 657 patients and demonstrates a significant improvement in OS over time with the 2-year age standardized OS increasing from 36·4 % (95 % CI, 27·0-45·8 %) for patients diagnosed in 1998 to 68·6 % (95 % CI, 60·2-76·9)for patients diagnosed in 2020, corresponding to an absolute increase in 2-year OS of 32·2 % points (95 % CI, 19·1-45·2). Stratified analysis revealed improvements for both Philadelphia chromosome positive and negative ALL, across cytogenetic risk groups, and for B- and T-cell ALL, whereas the latter did not reach statistical significance. Improvements were seen across all ages; however, most pronounced for Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL and patients below 60 years of age. These results show a universal and continuous improvement in the treatment of adult ALL. Currently, novel treatment combination and advances in cellular therapy occur rapidly, and we expect even further improvements in the years to come. Northern Region of Denmark.",0
