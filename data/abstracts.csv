"Polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity in strawberry purees  impact of achene level and storage","17550269.0","In this study the impact of achenes on polyphenolic compounds, ascorbic acids, and antioxidant activities in strawberry purees at production and after storage at 6 and 22 degrees C for 8 and 16 weeks was investigated. Strawberry purees were made from flesh, berry, and achene-enriched homogenate and contained 0, 1.2, and 2.9% achenes, respectively. At production, strawberry purees made from flesh contained more anthocyanins, p-coumaroyl glycosides, and ascorbic acids, whereas increasing achene levels caused increasing levels of ellagic acid derivatives, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, total phenolics (TP), and antioxidant activities. In addition, the anthocyanins, TP, and ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) in purees with more achenes were better retained during storage. Ascorbic acids and anthocyanins declined rapidly during storage, whereas other polyphenols and antioxidant activities were more stable; that is, the contributions from anthocyanins and ascorbic acids to TP and antioxidant activities decreased. The findings that achenes contributed significantly to polyphenol content and stability of strawberry purees may be interesting in a nutritional and, thus, commercial, perspective.","0.0"
"Uptake and metabolism of epicatechin and its access to the brain after oral ingestion","12488137.0","Epicatechin is a flavan-3-ol that is commonly present in green teas, red wine, cocoa products, and many fruits, such as apples. There is considerable interest in the bioavailability of epicatechin after oral ingestion. In vivo studies have shown that low levels of epicatechin are absorbed and found in the circulation as glucuronides, methylated and sulfated forms. Recent research has demonstrated protective effects of epicatechin and one of its in vivo metabolites, 3'-O-methyl epicatechin, against neuronal cell death induced by oxidative stress. Thus, we are interested in the ability of ingested epicatechin to cross the blood brain barrier and target the brain. Rats were administered 100 mg/kg body weight/d epicatechin orally for 1, 5, and 10 d. Plasma and brain extracts were analyzed by HPLC with photodiode array detection and LC-MS/MS. This study reports the presence of the epicatechin glucuronide and 3'-O-methyl epicatechin glucuronide formed after oral ingestion in the rat brain tissue.","1.0"
"Composition and stability of anthocyanins in blue-grained wheat","12670152.0","Wheat grain is recognized as a good source of potentially health-enhancing components such as dietary fiber, phenolics, tocopherols, and carotenoids. Anthocyanins, another group of bioactive compounds, are found in blue and purple wheat grains. In the present study, a blue aleurone spring wheat line ""Purendo 38"" with relatively high content of total anthocyanins was used to investigate the composition and stability of anthocyanins over three crop years. Commercial cultivars of purple (Konini) and red (Katepwa) wheats were included in the study. Separation of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that each wheat had a distinct anthocyanin profile. Four major anthocyanins were separated from blue wheat extracts as compared to five anthocyanins in purple wheat. Cyanidin 3-glucoside was the predominant anthocyanin in purple wheat, whereas it was the second major anthocyanin in blue wheat. The predominant anthocyanin in blue wheat, making up approximately 41% of the total anthocyanin content, remains to be structurally unidentified. Blue wheat anthocyanins were thermally most stable at pH 1. Their degradation was slightly lower at pH 3 as compared to pH 5. Increasing the temperature from 65 to 95 degrees C increased degradation of blue wheat anthocyanins. Addition of SO(2) during heating of blue wheat had a stabilizing effect on anthocyanin pigments. The optimal SO(2) concentrations were 500-1000 ppm for whole meals and 1000-3000 ppm for isolated anthocyanins. Further studies are underway to identify and verify individual anthocyanins in blue wheat and their potential end uses.","2.0"
"Anthocyanin composition in black, blue, pink, purple, and red cereal grains","16787017.0","Anthocyanin pigments from a wide variety of edible and ornamental black, blue, pink, purple, red, and white wheat, barley, corn, rice, and wild rice were identified and quantified to evaluate their potential as natural colorants or functional food ingredients. The total anthocyanin contents varied significantly and exhibited a range of 7-3276 microg/g. Some grains, such as red rice and black rice, contained a limited number of pigments, whereas others, such as blue, pink, purple, and red corns, had complex anthocyanin profiles. Of the 42 anthocyanin compounds observed, 9 were characterized by comparison of the spectroscopic and chromatographic properties with those of authentic standards. The remaining compounds were tentatively identified on the basis of spectroscopic properties and electrospray ionization mass spectra. The most abundant anthocyanins were cyanidin 3-glucoside in black and red rices and in blue, purple, and red corns, pelargonidin 3-glucoside in pink corn, and delphinidin 3-glucoside in blue wheat.","3.0"
"Preliminary study of resveratrol content in Aragon red and rose wines","","A survey of resveratrol content in wines of the four Aragón designations of origin (Borja, Cariñena, Calatayud and Somontano) was carried out. Concentrations of trans- and cis-resveratrol isomers of 98 commercial wines of the four designations of origin, from several vintages, were analyzed by means of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Concentration of trans-resveratrol ranged from 0.32 to 4.44 mg/l in red wines and from 0.12 to 2.80 mg/l in rosé wines. cis-Resveratrol levels ranged from 0.20 to 5.84 mg/l in red wines and from 0.02 to 3.17 mg/l in rosé wines. The grape variety influenced resveratrol contents in wines from the different regions. The highest trans/cis ratios were found in Somontano (4.50) and Calatayud wines (2.90), both of the Tempranillo variety. However, a discriminant analysis applied to the concentrations did not show significant differences between young red wines nor between rosé wines of the four designations of origin.","4.0"
"HPLC method for the quantification of procyanidins in cocoa and chocolate samples and correlation to total antioxidant capacity","10552788.0","Monomeric and oligomeric procyanidins present in cocoa liquors and chocolates were separated and quantified in four different laboratories using a normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection. Procyanidin standards through decamers were obtained by extraction from cocoa beans, enrichment by Sephadex LH-20 gel permeation chromatography, and final purification by preparative normal-phase HPLC. The purity of each oligomeric fraction was assessed using HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry. A composite standard was then prepared, and calibration curves were generated for each oligomeric class using a quadratic fit of area sum versus concentration. Results obtained by each of the laboratories were in close agreement, which suggests this method is reliable and reproducible for quantification of procyanidins. Furthermore, the procyanidin content of the samples was correlated to the antioxidant capacity measured using the ORAC assay as an indicator for potential biological activity.","5.0"
"Enhancement of total phenolics and antioxidant properties of some tropical green leafy vegetables by steam cooking","","This study sought to evaluate the effect of steam cooking on the vitamin C, total phenolics, total flavonoid and antioxidant properties (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH] free radical and 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonate) [ABTS*] radical scavenging abilities, reducing property and Fe2+ chelating ability) of some tropical green leafy vegetables: Talinum triangulare, Ocimum gratissimum, Amaranthus hybridus, Telfairia occidentalis, Ipomea batata, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Baselia alba and Senecio biafrae leaves. The results of the study revealed that cooking causes a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the vitamin C (raw [321.4–842.0], cooked [198.2–638.4 mg/100 g]) content. Conversely, there was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the total phenol (raw [146.9–693.8], cooked [272.9–1037.5 mg/100 g]), total flavonoid (raw [8.2–53.0], cooked [12.9–57.4 mg/100 g]), DPPH radical scavenging ability (raw [15.7–61.8], cooked [52.8–92.7%]), reducing property (raw: 28.3–61.8; cooked: 43.9–71.6 mg/100 g ascorbic acid equivalent [AAE]), Fe2+ chelating ability (raw [17.4–75.4], cooked [22.8–89.2%]) and ABTS* scavenging ability (raw [17.4–87.3], cooked [57.5–113.2 mmol/100 g trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity]). In view of this, it could be concluded that steam cooking decreases the vitamin C content of all the vegetables, while it increased the phenolic content and antioxidant activities.","6.0"
"Urinary excretion of lignans and isoflavonoid phytoestrogens in Japanese men and women consuming a traditional Japanese diet","1659780.0","Epidemiologic studies revealed low mortality in hormone-dependent cancer in Japanese women and men consuming a traditional diet. We previously found that certain diphenolic food components, lignans and isoflavonoids, which are converted to biologically active hormone-like substances by intestinal microflora, may be cancer-protective agents. Therefore, we studied urinary excretion of these compounds (enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, and O-desmethylangolensin) in 10 women and 9 men in a rural village south of Kyoto, Japan. The subjects consumed a typical low-fat diet with much rice and soy products, fish, and vegetables. An isotope-dilution gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method was used for the assays. The urinary excretion of lignans was low but that of the isoflavonoids was very high. The excretion of isoflavonoids correlated with soybean-product intake. The low mortality in breast and prostate cancer of Japanese women and men, respectively, may be due to the high intake of soybean products.","7.0"
"Antioxidant activity of grains","12358499.0","Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of whole grains and grain-based products is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. The health benefits of whole grains are attributed in part to their unique phytochemical composition. However, the phytochemical contents in grains have been commonly underestimated in the literature, because bound phytochemicals were not included. This study was designed to investigate the complete phytochemical profiles in free, soluble conjugated, and insoluble bound forms, as well as their antioxidant activities in uncooked whole grains. Corn had the highest total phenolic content (15.55 +/- 0.60 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain) of the grains tested, followed by wheat (7.99 +/- 0.39 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain), oats (6.53 +/- 0.19 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain), and rice (5.56 +/- 0.17 micromol of gallic acid equiv/g of grain). The major portion of phenolics in grains existed in the bound form (85% in corn, 75% in oats and wheat, and 62% in rice), although free phenolics were frequently reported in the literature. Ferulic acid was the major phenolic compound in grains tested, with free, soluble-conjugated, and bound ferulic acids present in the ratio 0.1:1:100. Corn had the highest total antioxidant activity (181.42 +/- 0.86 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), followed by wheat (76.70 +/- 1.38 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), oats (74.67 +/- 1.49 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain), and rice (55.77 +/- 1.62 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of grain). Bound phytochemicals were the major contributors to the total antioxidant activity: 90% in wheat, 87% in corn, 71% in rice, and 58% in oats. Bound phytochemicals could survive stomach and intestinal digestion to reach the colon. This may partly explain the mechanism of grain consumption in the prevention of colon cancer, other digestive cancers, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, which is supported by epidemiological studies.","8.0"
"Phytochemicals and antioxidant activity of milled fractions of different wheat varieties","15769171.0","The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in part to their unique phytochemical contents and profiles that complement those found in fruits and vegetables. Wheat is an important component of the human diet; however, little is known about the phytochemical profiles and total antioxidant activities of milled fractions of different wheat varieties. The objectives of this study were to investigate the distribution of phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, ferulic acid, and carotenoids) and to determine hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activity in milled fractions (endosperm and bran/germ) of three different wheat varieties, two of which were grown in two environments. Grain samples of each of the wheat varieties were milled into endosperm and bran/germ fractions. Each fraction was extracted and analyzed for total phenolics, ferulic acid, flavonoids, carotenoid contents, and hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant activities. Total phenolic content of bran/germ fractions (2867-3120 micromol of gallic acid equiv/100 g) was 15-18-fold higher (p < 0.01) than that of respective endosperm fractions. Ferulic acid content ranged from 1005 to 1130 micromol/100 g in bran/germ fractions and from 15 to 21 micromol/100 g in the endosperm fractions. The bran/germ fraction flavonoid content was 740-940 micromol of catechin equiv/100 g. On average, bran/germ fractions of wheat had 4-fold more lutein, 12-fold more zeaxanthin, and 2-fold more beta-cryptoxanthin than the endosperm fractions. Hydrophilic antioxidant activity of bran/germ samples (7.1-16.4 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g) was 13-27-fold higher than that of the respective endosperm samples. Similarly, lipophilic antioxidant activity was 28-89-fold higher in the bran/germ fractions (1785-4669 nmol of vitamin E equiv/g). Hydrophilic antioxidant activity contribution to the total antioxidant activity (hydrophilic + lipophilic) was >80%. In whole-wheat flour, the bran/germ fraction contributed 83% of the total phenolic content, 79% of the total flavonoid content, 51% of the total lutein, 78% of the total zeaxanthin, 42% of the total beta-cryptoxanthin, 85% of the total hydrophilic antioxidant activity, and 94% of the total lipophilic antioxidant activity. Our results showed that different milled fractions of wheat have different profiles of both hydrophilic and lipophilic phytochemicals. These findings provide information necessary for evaluating contributions to good health and disease prevention from whole-wheat consumption.","9.0"

"Evaluation of Phenolic Profile and Antioxidant Properties of Pardina Lentil As Affected by Industrial Dehydration","20735138.0","This study presents the effects of soaking, cooking, and industrial dehydration treatments on phenolic profile and also on antioxidant properties in Pardina lentil. HPLC-PAC and HPLC-MS (ESI) analysis identified a total of 35 phenolic compounds in raw and processed lentil flours, corresponding to catechins and procyanidins (69% of the total of identified phenolic compounds), flavonols (17%), flavones, and flavanones (5%), and hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic compounds (5 and 4%, respectively). During the industrial process, catechins and procyanidins, flavonols, flavones, and flavanones decreased, while hydroxybenzoic compounds exhibited an important increase. In addition, raw lentils showed high values of the antioxidant activity (66.97 μmol Trolox/g); although the thermal processing promotes decreased, the levels of antioxidant activity were still relevant. Thus, the significant occurrence of bioactive phenolic compounds along with the interesting antioxidant capacity of dehydrated lentil flours make them useful for daily inclusion in the human diet as ready-to-use for special meals to specific populations.","11.0"

"Functional attributes of soybean seeds and products, with reference to isoflavone content and antioxidant activity","","The concentrations of isoflavones, especially daidzein and genistein, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography in 4 soybean cultivars and 26 soybean products. The total isoflavone content of the soybean cultivars was in the range of 525–986 mg per kg, and for soy products it was 32.9–795 mg per kg. Amongst the soybean products, the isoflavone content decreased in the order: soy sprouts, soy seeds, soy flour, soy milk, soy meals and soy sauce. Significant differences in the concentration of genistein and daidzein were observed between the commercial soy products and also within the soybean cultivars. The antioxidant activity of soybean and soy products correlated well with total phenolic content (TPC) and total isoflavones (TI), whereas TPC showed higher correlation with TI.","13.0"
"Comparison of antioxidant activity, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics of three native fresh and sun-dried date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) varieties grown in Oman","16159191.0","Fresh and sun-dried dates of three native varieties from Oman, namely, Fard, Khasab, and Khalas, were examined for their antioxidant activity and total contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and phenolics, as well as free and bound phenolic acids. All results are expressed as mean value +/- standard deviation (n = 3) on a fresh weight basis. Fresh date varieties were found to be a good source of antioxidants (11687-20604 micromol of Trolox equiv/g), total contents of anthocyanins (0.24-1.52 mg of cyanidin 3-glucoside equiv/100 g), carotenoids (1.31-3.03 mg/100 g), phenolics (134-280 mg of ferulic acid equiv/100 g), free phenolic acids (2.61-12.27 mg/100 g), and bound phenolic acids (6.84-30.25 mg/100 g). A significant (p < 0.05) amount of antioxidants and carotenoids was lost after sun-drying of dates, whereas the total content of phenolics and free and bound phenolic acids increased significantly (p < 0.05). Anthocyanins were detected only in fresh dates. Date varieties had different levels and patterns of phenolic acids. Four free phenolic acids (protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid) and nine bound phenolic acids (gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and o-coumaric acid) were tentatively identified. Of the date varieties studied, Khalas, which is considered to be premium quality, had higher antioxidant activity, total carotenoids, and bound phenolic acids than other varieties. These results suggest that all date varieties serve as a good source of natural antioxidants and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food ingredient, although some of their antioxidant constituents are lost during sun-drying.","14.0"
"Compositional and functional characteristics of dates, syrups, and their by-products","","Three native sun-dried date varieties from Oman (namely Mabseeli, Um-sellah, and Shahal), as well as their syrups and by-products (press cake and seed) were examined for their proximate composition, dietary fibre, total phenolics, and total antioxidant activity. Carbohydrate was the predominant component in all date varieties, syrups, and their by-products, followed by moisture, along with small amounts of protein, fat, and ash. Press cakes had the highest protein content, ranging in concentration from 3.62 g/100 g in Shahal to 5.23 g/100 g in Mabseeli, whereas fat was the highest in seeds and ranged from 5.02 g/100 g in Mabseeli to 5.90 g/100 g in Um-sellah. Seeds and press cakes were found to be good sources of dietary fibre, varied between 77.75 and 80.15 g/100 g fresh weight and between 25.39 and 33.81 g/100 g fresh weight, respectively. Among dates, syrups, and their by-products, seeds had the highest contents of total phenolics (3102–4430 mg of gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh weight) and antioxidant activity (580–929 μmol of Trolox equivalents/g fresh weight). The results obtained suggest that date by-products (particularly seeds) serve as a good source of natural antioxidants and could potentially be considered as a functional food or functional food ingredient.","15.0"
"Nutritional composition of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) as affected by  microwave cooking and other traditional cooking methods","","The effects of microwave cooking and other traditional cooking methods such as boiling and autoclaving on the nutritional composition and anti-nutritional factors of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) were studied. Cooking treatments caused significant (P<0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions (reducing sugars, sucrose, raffinose and stachyose, while verbascose was completely eliminated after cooking treatments), antinutritional factors (trypsin inhibitor, haemagglutinin activity, tannins, saponins and phytic acid), minerals and B-vitamins. Cooking treatments decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, cooked chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. In-vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid index were improved by all cooking treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino acid of chickpeas subjected to the various cooking treatments varied considerably, depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking is recommended for chickpea preparation, not only for improving nutritional quality (by reducing the level of antinutritional and flatulence factors as well as increasing in-vitro protein digestibility and retention rates of both B-vitamins and minerals), but also for reducing cooking time.","16.0"
"Characterization and antioxidant activity of nocino liqueur","","Nocino is an after-dinner liqueur made with green, unripe walnuts, appreciated both for its appealing flavour and aroma, and for its properties as a tonic and digestive aid. There is a large number of recipes for the production of nocino and the industrial production coexists with preparations at home. The liqueur has never been scientifically investigated; thus the aim of this work was to examine various kinds of it. Three sets of samples were considered: Commercial brands, home-made nocino and, among the latter, samples made for years with the same recipe and aged for different times, up to 25 years. In the commercial products, the phenolic profiles and the antioxidant activities were widely variable. The antioxidant activity proved to be directly correlated with the content of total phenols, total tannins and non-tannin phenolics. Study of samples aged for different lengths of time showed that the characteristics considered remained substantially unchanged during the aging process.","17.0"

A total of 35 volatiles were identified in all carrots, 27 positively. White carrot contained the highest content of volatiles, followed by orange, purple, and yellow. In total, 11, 16, 10, and 9 phenolic compounds were determined for the first time in orange, purple, yellow, and white carrots, respectively. Of these, chlorogenic acid was the most predominant phenolic compound in all carrot varieties. Differences (p < 0.05) in relative sweetness, the contents of vitamin C and alpha- and beta-carotenes, and certain flavor characteristics were observed among the colored carrot varieties examined. Purple carrots contained 2.2 and 2.3 times more alpha- and beta-carotenes (trace in yellow; not detected in white) than orange carrots, respectively. Purple carrot may be used in place of other carrot varieties to take advantage of its nutraceutical components.","18.0"
"Effects of Roasting on Taste-Active Compounds of TurkisH Hazelnut Varieties (Corylus avellana L.)","20681657.0","The effect of roasting on taste-active components of 18 native hazelnut varieties, grown in the Giresun province of Turkey, was assessed. Samples were examined for their sugars, organic acids, condensed tannins, and free phenolic acids. Six sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, myo-inositol, raffinose, and stachyose), seven organic acids (oxalic, maleic, citric, malic, lactic, succinic, and acetic), and one phenolic acid (gallic acid) were positively identified in natural and roasted hazelnut varieties; among these, sucrose, malic acid, and gallic acid predominated, respectively. Total sugars among hazelnut varieties ranged from 1.99 to 4.94 g/100 g, organic acids from 0.96 to 2.72 g/100 g, condensed tannins from 3.99 to 40.56 mg of catechin equivalents/g, and gallic acid from 0.159 to 0.871 mg/100 g. Differences existed in the sugar and organic acid contents between natural and roasted hazelnut varieties, but they did not follow any particular trend. Significant losses (p < 0.05) in condensed tannins ( approximately 97.3%) and gallic acid ( approximately 66.7%) were noted when the hazelnuts were roasted. The present work suggests that roasting resulted in significant loss in condensed tannins and gallic acid due to the removal of the brown skin. The effect of roasting on sugars and organic acids was not noteworthy.","19.0"
"Anthocyanins characterization of 15 Iranian pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties and their variation after cold storage and pasteurization","","Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits and vegetables. Apart from imparting color to plants, ACs also have an array of health-promoting benefits. In this research, the amounts of major ACs of 15 pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) varieties obtained from Yazd province were determined. The major ACs detected in the studied varieties were as follows: delphinidin 3-glucoside (2.19–16.29 mg/L), delphinidin 3,5-diglucoside (2.36–63.07 mg/L), pelargonidin 3-glucoside (0.26–1.36 mg/L), pelargonidin 3,5-diglucoside (0.01–8.11 mg/L), cyanidin 3-glucoside (5.78–30.38 mg/L), and cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside (4.39–166.32 mg/L). The effect of storage time of unprocessed and pasteurized juices on ACs content of four selected varieties was also studied. Average degradation percentage of each AC was between 23.0 and 83.0% during 10 days at 4 °C. Moreover, in pasteurized juices average degradation of ACs was 42.8 ± 0.5% after 10 weeks storage at 4 °C.","20.0"
"Effects of extrusion and traditional processing methods on antinutrients and in vitro digestibility of protein and starch in faba and kidney beans","","Comparative effects of extrusion cooking and conventional processing methods on protein content and reduction of antinutritional factor (phytic acid, condensed tannins, polyphenols, trypsin, chymotrypsin, α-amylase inhibitors and haemagglutinating activity) levels in Vicia faba and Phaseolus vulgaris seeds were studied. In vitro protein and starch digestibilities were assessed. P. vulgaris seeds showed highest levels of condensed tannins, chymotrypsin and α-amylase inhibitory activities and haemagglutinating activity. Dehulling significantly increased protein content and greatly reduced condensed tannin and polyphenol levels in both legumes. Extrusion was the best method to abolish trypsin, chymotrypsin, α-amylase inhibitors and haemagglutinating activity without modifying protein content. Furthermore, this thermal treatment was most effective in improving protein and starch digestibilities when compared with dehulling, soaking and germination.","21.0"
"Study of the antioxidant power of brandies and vinegars derived from Sherry wines and correlation with their content in polyphenols","","The protective effect on health of wine consumed in moderation has been widely studied in recent years. This has been attributed to the content in polyphenols and to the antioxidant activity of these compounds. The products derived from wine, such as vinegar and brandy, also contain polyphenols and could possess a certain antioxidant activity, similarly contributing to a protective effect for health. This paper describes the study of the antioxidant power of diverse Sherry brandies and vinegars, by means of an electrochemical method previously devised. The total polyphenolic content is studied using the method of Folin–Ciocalteu, and some polyphenols are identified and quantified by means of HPLC. A close correlation between the antioxidant power and the total polyphenolic content of the samples has been found. Considering the polyphenols individually, the compounds that are better correlated with the antioxidant power of the samples are not necessarily those that are present in higher concentrations. For brandies, the contact with wood has an important contribution to their antioxidant power.","22.0"

The performance of the method was assessed by the evaluation of parameters such as absolute recovery (generally higher than 60%), repeatability (lower than 10%), linearity (r2 higher than 0.993) and limits of quantitation (ranging from 1 to 37 microg/L); no matrix effects were observed. The polyphenol content of different Spanish alcohol-free beers is presented. Five phenolic compounds such as protocatechuic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic acids, and (+)-catechin were identified at levels lower than 10 mg/L.","23.0"
"Determination of polyphenolic profiles of Basque cider apple varieties using accelerated solvent extraction","11513662.0","Polyphenols in the peel and pulp of 15 Basque cider apple varieties were determined by accelerated solvent extraction followed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. It was observed that the polyphenolic composition in apple peel depended on varieties, whereas the main classes of phenolic compounds in apple pulp were flavan-3-ols and hydroxycinnamic acids in all cases, representing both together between 86 and 95% of total polyphenols assayed.","24.0"
"Polyphenolic profiles of Basque cider apple cultivars and their technological properties","15137839.0","The polyphenolic compositions of 31 Basque cider apple cultivars were determined in pulp, peel, and juice by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection analysis of crude extracts and after thiolysis. Total polyphenols are distributed in a wide concentration range depending on the cultivar. Procyanidins are the class of polyphenols that present major concentrations in apple. Their average degrees of polymerization range from 4 to 8 depending on the cultivar. Apple cultivars were technologically classified into bitter and nonbitter categories using different classification systems obtained by applying several pattern recognition techniques, such as principal component analysis, K-nearest neighbors, soft independent modeling of class analogy, partial least-squares, and multilayer feed-forward-artificial neural networks, to apple pulp, peel, or juice data (individual polyphenol concentrations, total procyanidin content, and the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins). Bitter apple cultivars present higher contents of flavan-3-ols and/or dihydrochalcones than nonbitter cultivars. Detailed knowledge of the polyphenolic profile of each apple cultivar affords information about their susceptibility to oxidation, their sensory properties (bitterness, astringency), and their possible influence on the characteristics and quality of the final product (juice, cider) when apples are processed.","25.0"
"Classification of apple fruits according to their maturity state by the pattern recognition analysis of their polyphenolic compositions","","Polyphenolic profiles of cider apple cultivars were studied in order to differentiate fruits according to their maturity state (ripe or unripe). Thiolysis and direct solvent extracts of freeze-dried apple pulps and peels were analysed by HPLC-DAD. Univariate data treatment did not achieve the mentioned target; thus a multivariate approach was considered. For each apple tissue data set, several chemometric techniques were applied to the most discriminant variables. Cluster analysis allowed a preliminary study of the data structure. Then, supervised pattern recognition procedures, namely linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbours, soft independent modelling of class analogy, and multilayer feed-forward artificial neural networks (MLF-ANN), were used to develop decision rules to classify samples in the established categories. Excellent results were afforded by MLF-ANN applied to the concentrations of total procyanidins and (+)-catechin and the average degree of polymerisation of procyanidins in apple pulp, with success in the prediction ability of 97% and 99% for unripe and ripe categories, respectively.","26.0"
"Influence of processing and pasteurization on color values and total phenolic compounds of pomegranate juice","","In this study, the influences of processing and pasteurization on color values and total phenolic compounds of pomegranate juices were investigated. Pomegranate juices were produced by different clarification techniques (conventional fining, conventional fining together with polyvinylpolypyrrolidone [PVPP], ultrafiltration). Nonclarified juice was also produced as control. Clarification methods, heat treatments and methods and heat treatments together significantly (P < 0.05) affected the color values of pomegranate juices. Moreover, conventional fining together with PVPP treatment was found to be the most effective method to remove phenolic compounds.","27.0"
"Influence of jam processing on the radical scavenging activity and phenolic content in berries","11312801.0","Six selected phenolic aglycons (caffeic and ellagic acids, kaempferol, quercetin, myricetin, and morin) in nine types of berries, and their changes as influenced by jam processing, have been evaluated using optimized HPLC with diode-array detection. The berry samples, fresh and after jam processing, were analyzed, and the total amounts of selected phenolics as aglycons were identified and determined by acid hydrolysis. Their contents in fresh and jam samples did not indicate appreciable changes; therefore, the influence of jam processing on these selected phenolics in berries was suggested to be small, and was mostly present in berries as several conjugated forms that were glycosylated, esterified, etc., in the samples. The total phenolic content of each sample was also determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The three samples of each berry, namely fresh, jam, and acid hydrolysate of the berry, had similar total phenolic contents. On the other hand, the scavenging effect on the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical was measured, and acid hydrolysates showed stronger activity than that of the fresh and jam-processed samples for all of the berry types.","28.0"
"Polyphenolics extracts from legume seeds: correlations between total antioxidant activity, total phenolics content, tannins content and astringency","","Extracts of polyphenolic compounds were obtained from seeds of faba bean, broad bean, adzuki bean, red bean, pea, red lentil and green lentil using 80% (v/v) acetone. The total antioxidant activity (TAA) of extracts was determined and their astringency (Sensation Astringency Indices – SAI) investigated using the sensory scaling method. The content of tannins in extracts was expressed as absorbance values at 500 and 550 nm after color developed with vanillin/HCl reagent and after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis, respectively. A statistically significant correlation was found between the TAA values and total phenolics (P = 0.01), TAA and tannins determined by vanillin method (P = 0.05), TAA and tannins determined after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis (P = 0.05), SAI values and tannins determined with vanillin method (P = 0.10), SAI values and tannins determined after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis (P = 0.05), SAI values and total phenolics (P = 0.01), total phenolics and tannin content determined by vanillin method (P = 0.01), total phenolics and tannin content determined after n-butanol-HCl hydrolysis (P = 0.05), tannins determined with vanillin method and tannins determined after n-butanol hydrolysis (P = 0.02).","29.0"
"Flavanone absorption after naringin, hesperidin, and citrus administration","8689809.0","Disposition of citrus flavonoids was evaluated after single oral doses of pure compounds (500 mg naringin and 500 mg hesperidin) and after multiple doses of combined grapefruit juice and orange juice and of once-daily grapefruit. Cumulative urinary recovery indicated low bioavailability ( < 25%) of naringin and hesperidin. The aglycones naringenin and hesperitin were detected in urine and plasma by positive chemical ionization-collisionally activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (PCI-CAD MS/MS). After juice administration, PCI-CAD MS/MS detected naringenin, hesperitin, and four related flavanones, tentatively identified as monomethoxy and dimethoxy derivatives. These methoxyflavanones appear to be absorbed from juice. Absorbed citrus flavanones may undergo glucuronidation before urinary excretion.","30.0"
"Effect of different blanching times on antioxidant properties in selected cruciferous vegetables","","This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different blanching times on the antioxidant properties (antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities) and phenolic content of selected cruciferous vegetables. The study revealed that a 10-min blanching time had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the antioxidant properties and phenolic content of all the vegetables except for cabbage and mustard cabbage. The loss of antioxidant activity was highest in Chinese cabbage (40%) after 15 min of blanching, followed by cabbage (27%), Chinese white cabbage (19%), mustard cabbage (9%) and red cabbage (4%). Red cabbage had lost a total of 40% scavenging activity after 15 min of blanching followed by Chinese cabbage (38%), cabbage (36%), mustard cabbage (23%) and Chinese white cabbage (11%). Only Chinese cabbage showed an increase (p < 0.05) in total phenolic content after 15 min of blanching compared with other vegetables. Minimal heat treatment through blanching process is recommended to prevent the major loss of antioxidant properties and phenolic content in selected cruciferous vegetables.

"Phenolic composition and browning susceptibility of various apple cultivars at maturity","","Phenolic compounds and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in the fruits of 11 apple cultivars before and after bruising were studied in relation to their susceptibility to browning. The degree of browning has been determined by the simultaneous measurements of soluble (absorbance at 400nm) and insoluble (lightness) brown pigments. The sum of these two expressing the extent of browning, closely correlated with the amount of phenolics (hydroxycinnamic derivatives and flavan-3-ols) degraded. Maturity did not appear to greatly influence the development of browning.","32.0"
"Phenolic composition and browning susceptibility of various apple and pear cultivars at maturity","","The main phenolic compounds in cortex tissues of apples and pears are hydroxycinnamic derivatives (HCD) and flavanols (FLA). Phenolic content (initial and residual) was determined by HPLC. The degree of browning was determined by the simultaneous measurements of soluble (absorbance at 400 nm) and insoluble (lightness L*) brown pigments. In apples, the sum of absorbance and lightness, expressing the extent of browning, is closely correlated to the amount of phenolics (HCD and FLA) degraded. Maturity does not appear to play a major role in the ability of apples to develop browning. In pears, no correlation was found between these sums and the amount of phenolics (initial or degraded). However, L* was correlated with the amount of two flavanols. The extent of browning seemed to depend on the maturity of pears. A better control of browning would probably consist firstly in a selection of cultivars with a low content in chlorogenic acid. Secondly, flavanol content and the relative balance of HCD and FLA are of great importance in the susceptibility to browning.","33.0"
"Influence of cultivar, maturity stage, and storage conditions on phenolic composition and enzymatic browning of pear fruits","","Processing of pears as a fresh-cut product could offer added value and introduce a product into the market that offers greater convenience and health benefits for consumers. Cultivar selection is one of the most important considerations for fresh-cut fruit processing because characteristics such as flesh texture, skin colour, and browning potential can vary greatly among cultivars. Four pear cultivars (‘Flor de invierno’, ‘Passe-Crassane’, ‘Ercolini’ and ‘Conference’) and four antioxidant treatments, that is, (NS) 50 g L-1 NatureSeal® AS1 (Agricoat) solution, (AsAc) 20 g L-1 ascorbic acid + 10 g L-1 citric acid + 10 g L-1 calcium chloride solution, (CaAs) 20 g L-1 calcium ascorbate + 10 g L-1 calcium chloride solution and (NaAs) 20 g L-1 sodium ascorbate + 10 g L-1 calcium chloride solution, were tested to obtain a high-quality fresh-cut pear. For the selected cultivar and treatment, the nutritional changes and physicochemical, microbial and sensorial quality were evaluated under conditions that simulated commercial application followed by storage at 4 °C and a simulated cold chain break at 8°C. The ‘Conference’ pear was selected as the best cultivar based on its physicochemical characteristics (high levels of soluble solids content and low acidity), low increase in browning index, and visual acceptance after 7 days of storage. The results demonstrated that CaAs maintained the fresh-cut pear quality after 8 days of storage at 4°C and also after a cold chain break. Furthermore, application of the selected treatment produced an increase in the ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of minimally processed pear samples. These values were reduced during shelf life, but the total phenolic content at the final sampling point was higher than that of fresh-cut pears after processing without treatment.","34.0"
"Ellagic acid, vitamin C, and total phenolic contents and radical scavenging capacity affected by freezing and frozen storage in raspberry fruit","11052701.0","The ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C contents in four raspberry cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Rubi, and Zeva) grown in Spain were detected and quantified by HPLC in fresh, just frozen, and stored fruits at -20 degrees C for a one year period. Ellagic acid [207-244 mg kg(-)(1) of fresh weight (fw)], total phenolic (137-1776 mg kg(-)(1) of fw), and vitamin C (221-312 mg kg(-)(1) of fw) contents in raw material were higher in the late cultivars Zeva and Rubi than in the early cultivars Autumn Bliss and Heritage. The freezing process slightly affected the values of extracted ellagic acid, total phenolic, and vitamin C content. At the end of long-term frozen storage (12 months), no significant change of total phenolic content extracted was observed, but significant decreases of 14-21% in ellagic acid and of 33-55% in vitamin C were quantified. Free radical scavenging capacity measured as antiradical efficiency (AE) depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Late cultivars, Rubi (6.1 x 10(-)(4)) and Zeva (10.17 x 10(-)(4)), showed higher AE than early cultivars, Heritage (4.02 x 10(-)(4)) and Autumn Bliss (4.36 x 10(-)(4)).

"Frozen storage effects on anthocyanins and volatile compounds of raspberry fruit","10725166.0","The quantitative and qualitative evolution of the anthocyanins and volatile compounds of four raspberry cultivars (cvs. Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva, and Rubi) growing in Spain were analyzed raw, just frozen, and during long-term frozen storage at -20 degrees C for a 1 year period. HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS and HPLC techniques were employed to study the evolution of the volatile compounds and the individual anthocyanins, respectively. The volatile aroma composition changes produced by the freezing process and long-term frozen storage were minimal. Only a significant increase in extraction capacity was obtained for alpha-ionone (27%) and for caryophyllene (67%) in Heritage at 12 months of storage. The stability of anthocyanins to freezing and frozen storage depends on the seasonal period of harvest. Heritage and Autumn Bliss (early cultivars) were less affected by processing and long-term frozen storage (1 year), and the total pigment extracted showed the tendency to increase 17 and 5%, respectively. Rubi and Zeva (late cultivars) suffered a decreased trend on the total anthocyanin content of 4% for Rubi and 17.5% for Zeva. Cyanidin 3-glucoside most easily suffered the degradative reactions that take place during processing and the storage period.","36.0"
"Potential antioxidants in beer assessed by ESR spin trapping","10956077.0","A number of potential antioxidants have been evaluated for their effect on formation of radicals in beer using the electron spin resonance (ESR) lag phase method. Sulfite was found to be the only compound that was able to delay the formation of radicals, whereas phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, catechin, epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin dimers had no effect on the formation of radicals. Ascorbate, cystein, and cysteamin were on the other hand found to be prooxidants. It is suggested that antioxidants must be able to either scavenge peroxides or trap metal ions in order to be effective in beer. The effectiveness of sulfite is suggested to be a consequence of its two-electron nonradical producing reaction with peroxides.","37.0"
"Influence of cooking process on phenolic marker compounds of vegetables","12747223.0","Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites which have long been associated with flavor and color characteristics of fruits and vegetables. These phenolic compounds attract great interest due to their postulated health protecting properties. However, adequate intakes and absorption rate of phenolic compounds are necessary for these beneficial effects. Until now, little is known about alterations of phenolic compounds content by the cooking process. In the present study, the influence of different volumes of cooking water on the amount of selected phenolic marker compounds resting in the vegetables was assessed. In zucchini, rutin was quantified as a marker for flavonoid glycosides. Chlorogenic acid, representative of phenolic acids was analyzed in carrots. In beans, rutin and quercitrin, both belonging to flavonoid glycosides, were investigated. In potatoes, chlorogenic and caffeic acid were determined. The cooking of zucchini, beans and carrots with smaller amounts of water resulted in significant higher content of phenolic phytochemicals in the vegetables compared to cooking with larger water volumes. For potatoes, which showed great variations in content of phenolic acids after cooking, no significant differences in phenolic acids was observed. It can be concluded from these observations, that real intakes of phenolic compounds from cooked vegetables are lower and that the amounts consumed are therefore overestimated.","38.0"

"Ferulic acid dehydrodimers in Rye","","Four ferulic acid dehydrodimers were isolated from rye bran and purified by preparative HPLC after alkaline hydrolysis. The identity of the compounds were confirmed by UV,1H and13C-NMR and mass spectroscopy. The content of the four identified dimers corresponded to a total dimer concentration of 307 μg/g (dry matter) of the whole grain. The concentrations in the bran fraction were 10–20 times higher than in the starchy endosperm. The four dimers were in decreasing amounts: ((Z)- β -{4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy}-4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-cinnamic acid (8-O-4′-DiFA);trans -5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (8-5′-DiFA benzofuran form), (E,E)-4,4′-dihydroxy-5,5′-dimethoxy-3,3′-bicinnamic acid (5-5′-DiFA) and (E,E)-4,4′-dihydroxy-3,5′-dimethoxy-β,3′-bicinnamic acid (8-5′-DiFA).

"Content of phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers in 17 rye (Secale cerealeL.) varieties","11032481.0","The contents of pnenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers were quantified by HPLC analysis after alkaline hydrolysis in kernels of 17 rye (Secale cereale L.) varieties grown in one location in Denmark during 1997 and 1998. Significant variations (P < 0.05) with regard to the concentration of the analyzed components were observed among the different rye varieties and also between different harvest years. However, the content of phenolic acids in the analyzed rye varieties was narrow compared to cereals such as wheat and barley. The concentration of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid ranged from 900 to 1170 microgram g(-1) dry matter.

The most abundant ferulic acid dehydrodimer 8-O-4 -DiFA was quantified in concentrations from 130 to 200 microgram g(-1) dry matter followed by 8,5 -DiFA benzofuran form (50-100 microgram g(-1) dry matter), 5,5 -DiFA (40-70 microgram g(-1) dry matter), and 8,5 -DiFA (20-40 microgram g(-1) dry matter).","41.0"
"Flavanol and flavonol contents of cocoa powder products: Influence of the manufacturing process","18412367.0","Major brands of cocoa powder products present in the Spanish market were analyzed for monomeric flavanols [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] and flavonols [quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-glucoside (isoquercitrin), quercetin-3-arabinoside, and quercetin]. In addition, the influence of the manufacturing process of cocoa powder products, in particular, the alkalinization treatment ( Dutching), on the original content of these flavonoids has been studied. (-)-Epicatechin was in the range of 116.02-730.26 microg/g, whereas (+)-catechin was in the range of 81.40-447.62 microg/g in the commercial cocoa products studied. Among flavonols, quercetin-3-arabinoside and isoquercitrin were the major flavonols in the cocoa powder products studied, ranging from 2.10 to 40.33 microg/g and from 3.97 to 42.74 microg/g, respectively, followed by quercetin-3-glucuronide (0.13-9.88 microg/g) and quercetin aglycone (0.28-3.25 microg/g). To our knowledge, these results are the first quantitative data in relation to the content of individualized flavonol derivatives in commercial cocoa powder products. The alkalinization treatment resulted in 60% loss of the mean total flavonoid content. Among flavanols, (-)-epicatechin presented a larger decline (67%, as a mean percentage difference) than (+)-catechin (38%), probably because of its epimerization into (-)-catechin, a less bioavailable form of catechin. A decline was also confirmed for di-, tri-, and tetrameric procyanidins. In the case of flavonols, quercetin presented the highest loss (86%), whereas quercetin-3-glucuronide, quercetin-3-arabinoside, and isoquercitrin showed a similar decrease (58, 62, and 61%, respectively). It is concluded that the large decrease found in the flavonoid content of natural cocoa powder, together with the observed change in the monomeric flavanol profile that results from the alkalinization treatment, could affect the antioxidant properties and the polyphenol biovailability of cocoa powder products.","42.0"

"Environmental and genetic variation of phenolic compounds in red raspberry","","Red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) is an economically important berry crop that contains numerous phenolic compounds with potential health benefits. It is known that the content of phenolics is affected by processing factors, but limited information is available on the influence of cultural factors or genotype. To clarify this issue, phenolic compounds were analysed from a diverse range of raspberry cultivars grown under northern European conditions, in Finland. The content of phenolic compounds varied widely and significantly between cultivars. The quercetin content ranged from 0.32 (yellow cultivar) to 1.55 mg/100 g fresh weight (fw) (cv. Balder). The ellagic acid content varied from 38 (cv. Gatineau and cv. Nova) to 118 mg/100 g fw (cv. Ville). The total anthocyanin content varied from close to 0 (yellow cultivars) to 51 mg/100 g fw (cv. Gatineau). The content of total phenolics varied from 192 (cv. Gatineau) to 359 mg/100 g fw (cv. Ville). In addition, environment had a significant effect on the content of quercetin. Thus, breeding material should be evaluated for their potential health benefits over several regions in northern raspberry breeding.","44.0"

The beans studied were cropped in the same area and were from the same lot. The highest amount of condensed tannins (CT) was found in the seed coat of recently harvested beans [222.41 ± 16mg of (+)-catechin equivalents per gram of seed coat]. After 2 yof storage, the amount of CT dropped significantly [35.8 ± 3.4 mg of (+) -catechin equivalents per gram of seed coat]. Thermal treatment significantly reduced the amount of CT in whole beans by approximately 70%. The raw seeds contained 13.76 ±1.2 mg of (+)-cat-echin equivalents per gram of seeds and a portion of CT appeared in the broth [9.4 ± 0.1 mg of (+) -catechin equivalents per gram of lyophilized broth]. The antimutagenic activity of these extracted phenolic compounds was tested against aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the Kado microsuspension assay. Newly harvested beans showed higher antimutagenic activity against AFB1 mutagenicity than stored beans. The results suggest that to take the maximum advantage of components with biological activity present in beans, they must be used fresh.","46.0"

"Evaluation of the antioxidant capacity of blood orange juices as influenced by constituents, concentration process and storage","","Total Antioxidant Activities (TAA) of freshly squeezed and processed blood and blond orange juices were measured using the ABTS radical-cation method. Blood juices have TAA values higher than blond juices, and freshly-squeezed juices are higher than processed. Levels of ascorbic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid and anthocyanins were determined in order to calculate relative contributions to TAA by Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of such constituents. Ascorbic acid was the main contributor (∼70%), followed by hydroxycinnamic acids and anthocyanins. Calculated TAA accounted for 91% (mean) of that measured, reaching a maximum of 98% (mean) for the ‘not-from-concentrate’ blood juices (NFC). Reconstituted (from concentrate) blood juices (RFC) had higher TAA than NFC, and the difference could be ascribed to the increased amount of carotenoid pigments in the serum of RFC juices, as a consequence of the thermal concentration process. Despite the degradation of anthocyanins during storage, TAA of NFC and RFC juices remained unchanged up to 60 days at 2°C, whereas it decreased when RFC juice was stored at 20°C, in accordance with the observed decrease of ascorbic acid.","49.0"

The total polyphenol (TP) concentration was found to vary from 1217 to 3772 mg L−1 gallic acid equivalents, total anthocyanin (TA) content ranged from 44.3 to 360.1 mg L−1, and total flavanol (TF) from 291.1 to 664.8 mg L−1 catechin equivalents. The antiradical activity was evaluated using DPPH•, and varied from 0.73 to 1.37 m M Trolox® equivalents, while reducing power values were from 5.29 to 10.80 m M ascorbic acid equivalents, using a modified FRAP assay. The hydroxyl free radical scavenging activity was determined with the deoxyribose method, and ranged from 38.5 to 59.9% decrease in A532 relative to control. The examinations showed that TP and TF may provide a significant contribution to the overall antioxidant status of wines, but TA appears to be a less important factor in this respect. Reducing power was found to be highly associated with the antiradical activity of wines.","50.0"

The results obtained in this study showed that irrigation applied to olive trees let to a considerable decrease in the phenol content of the olive paste. The water status of the trees affected the phenol synthesis in the olive fruit, and consequently the phenol content of the olive paste, more than the partitioning of the phenolic compounds during the olive oil extraction process. The most remarkable point of the phenol partitioning was related to the simple phenols. While in the samples from non-irrigated trees the greater proportion of these phenols partitioned into the pomace, in samples from irrigated trees most of them were lost in the wastewater. After comparison of the results obtained from the experiments with and without NMT addition, it was concluded that the use of that co-adjuvant did not significantly alter either the phenolic profile of the oil phase obtained or the content of the individual phenolic compounds.","51.0"
"Transfer of phenolic compounds during olive oil extraction in relation to ripening stage of the fruit","","The transfer of phenolic compounds of Olea europaea L. cv. Arbequina variety during olive oil extraction in relation to ripening stage was investigated. The parameters of oil extraction by the Abencor system are shown together with mass balances of the products and by products from the olive oil extraction in relation to olive paste. The phenolic compounds in olive paste, pomace, oil and wastewater were identified and measured by HPLC. Throughout the study, the concentrations of simple phenols, secoiridoids and flavonoids were higher in the olive paste and pomace phases than in oil and wastewater phases. High concentrations of 4-(acetoxyethyl)-1,2-dihydroxybenzene (3,4-DHPEA-AC) and secoiridoid derivatives such as the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to 3,4-DHPEA (hydroxytyrosol) or p-HPEA (tyrosol) (3,4-DHPEA–EDA, p-HPEA–EDA, where EDA is elenolic acid dialdehyde) and an isomer of oleuropein aglycone (3,4-DHPEA–EA, where EA is elenolic acid aldehyde) were found in olive oil, together with lignan compounds. It was observed that 3,4-DHPEA–EDA was the most abundant polyphenol present in the wastewater phase. This indicates that biotransformation occurred during olive extraction, especially in the crushing and malaxation operations, and reflects the possible chemical changes that lead to the formation of new compounds. Moreover, the distribution of compounds showed their affinities toward different phases.","52.0"

"Processing-induced changes in total phenolics and procyanidins in clingstone peaches","","Clingstone peaches contain a wide array of complex secondary plant metabolites and polyphenolics, and increasing evidence indicates that many of these components are important in human health. Oligomeric flavan-3-ol metabolites (procyanidins) are particularly interesting owing to their potent antioxidant activity and protective cardiovascular effects. To date, little information is available on how postharvest and processing conditions impact levels of phenolics and procyanidins in fruit. This research addresses the impact of lye peeling, freezing, storage temperature (4 and 30 °C) and three different time–temperature sterilisation combinations on levels of total phenolics (TPs) in Ross clingstone peaches. Additionally, we describe the profile of procyanidin oligomers (monomers through heptamers) in clingstone and freestone peaches and demonstrate a dramatic decrease in procyanidins in thermally processed peaches. TP levels ranged between 316 and 397 mg kg−1 in peeled peaches and between 376 and 609 mg kg−1 in unpeeled peaches. Cold storage at 4 °C for 14 days or freezing and storing at −12 °C for 3 months produced no loss in TPs. Peaches stored at 30 °C for 24 h resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in TPs. Studies of TPs in peaches processed at temperatures of 213 °F for 40 min, 220 °F for 10 min and 230 °F for 2.4 min indicate that processing above 213 °F decreases levels of both TPs (up to 21%) and procyanidins (up to 100%). Processing at 213 °F for 40 min produced no significant loss in TPs. Furthermore, studies reveal that a 30–43% loss in phenolic levels occurs during the first 3 months in storage after canning. It is clear that both storage and thermal processing conditions profoundly impact the levels of polyphenolics in peaches. More interestingly, these studies indicate that peaches are a rich source of procyanidins, having profiles similar to those found in cocoa, apples, wine and tea.","56.0"
"Comparison of the total phenolic and ascorbic acid content of freeze-dried and air-dried marionberry, strawberry, and corn grown using conventional, organic, and sustainable agricultural practices","12590461.0","Secondary phenolic metabolites play an important role in plant defense mechanisms, and increasing evidence indicates that many are important in human health. To date, few studies have investigated the impact of various agricultural practices on levels of secondary plant metabolites. To address this issue, the total phenolic (TP) content of marionberries, strawberries, and corn grown by sustainable, organic, or conventional cultural practices were measured. Additionally, the effects of three common postharvest processing treatments (freezing, freeze-drying, and air-drying) on the TP content of these agricultural products were also investigated. Statistically higher levels of TPs were consistently found in organically and sustainably grown foods as compared to those produced by conventional agricultural practices. In all samples, freeze-drying preserved higher levels of TPs in comparison with air-drying.","57.0"
"Inhibition of cancer growth by resveratrol is related to its low bioavailability","12126761.0","The relationship between resveratrol (RES) bioavalability and its effect on tumor growth was investigated. Tissue levels of RES were studied after i.v. and oral administration of trans-resveratrol (t-RES) to rabbits, rats, and mice. Half-life of RES in plasma, after i.v. administration of 20 mg t-RES/kg b.wt., was very short (e.g., 14.4 min in rabbits). The highest concentration of RES in plasma, either after i.v. or oral administration (e.g., 2.6 +/- 1.0 microM in mice 2.5 min after receiving 20 mg t-RES/kg orally), was reached within the first 5 min in all animals studied. Extravascular levels (brain, lung, liver, and kidney) of RES, which paralleled those in plasma, were always < 1 nmol/g fresh tissue. RES measured in plasma or tissues was in the trans form (at least 99%). Hepatocytes metabolized t-RES in a dose-dependent fashion (e.g., 43 nmol of t-RES/g x min in the presence of 20 microM tRES), which means that the liver can remove circulating RES very rapidly. In vitro B16 melanoma (B16M) cell proliferation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was inhibited by t-RES in a concentration-dependent fashion (100% inhibition of tumor growth was found in the presence of 5 microM t-RES). Addition of 10 microM H(2)O(2) to B16M cells, cultured in the presence of 5 microM t-RES, reactivated cell growth. Oral administration of t-RES (20 mg/kg twice per day; or included in the drinking water at 23 mg/l) did not inhibit growth of B16M inoculated into the footpad of mice (solid growth). However, oral administration of t-RES (as above) decreased hepatic metastatic invasion of B16M cells inoculated intrasplenically. The antimetastatic mechanism involves a t-RES (1 microM)-induced inhibition of vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium (HSE), which consequently decreased in vitro B16M cell adhesion to the endothelium via very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).","58.0"
"Chemical structure of flavonoid compounds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour that contribute to the yellow colour of Asian alkaline noodles","","Colour is an important criterion of quality in Asian noodles prepared from bread-wheat flour and ranges from white to cream for white salted noodles to a bright yellow for alkaline noodles. A high-performance liquid chromatographic protocol for the analysis of naturally occurring flavonoids and related phenolic compounds in wheat was developed to identify the compounds responsible for the yellow colour of alkaline noodles. The separation system consisted of a C18 reversed-phase column and a gradient system of water/formic acid (99:1,v/v) (A) and methanol/acetonitrile/formic acid (95:4:1,v/v/v) (B). A post column derivatisation technique was employed to identify the compounds that turned yellow at alkaline pH. A comparison of the HPLC profiles of water, alkaline water and hydroxylamine soluble fractions revealed that the level of compounds contributing to yellow alkaline noodle colour was highest in the hydroxylamine extract. Two flavonoid apigenin-C-diglycosides and their Wessely–Moser isomers, together with their sinapic acid esters, were isolated and identified by absorbance spectroscopy, ES-MS spectrometry and 13C NMR. These flavone-C-diglycosides were found to be the major components responsible for the alkali-induced change in noodle colour and are relatively stable at ambient temperature. Furthermore the compounds are located only in the germ (embryo+scutellum tissue) of wheat grains and hence their presence in flour must represent a redistribution during the milling process.","59.0"
"Factors affecting the caffeine and polyphenol contents of black and green tea infusions","11714326.0","The effects of product and preparation variables on the in-cup chemical composition of tea extracts is of interest because the appearance and taste characteristics and the possible health effects of a tea liquor arise from the chemical components extracted from the leaf during tea preparation. A comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared according to the instructions given on their packaging.","60.0"
"Separation of flavanone-7-O-glycoside diastereomers and analysis in citrus juices by multidimensional liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry","15315361.0","The major flavanone-7-O-glycoside constituents in citrus fruit juices (naringin, hesperidin, neohesperidin, narirutin, and eriocitrin) were separated as diastereomers by multidimensional liquid chromatography. The method consisted of coupling two HPLC columns: a reversed-phase (RP(18)) column was used for the separation of flavanone glycosides, which were, then, individually switched into a carboxymethylated beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-based column and resolved as the corresponding stereoisomers. The method was used for the full analysis of flavanone glycosides in fresh hand-squeezed and commercial fruit juices by combining the quantitative estimation with the diastereomeric analysis. Quantitative data were in general consistent with previously reported data in this field. CC-LC isomer analysis was carried out by coupling the beta-CD column with a mass spectrometer operated with negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI-MS). The results showed that hesperidin was present in orange juices almost exclusively as the 2S isomer, whereas narirutin had mainly the 2R configuration. In grapefruit juices (2S)-naringin prevailed with the respect to the 2R isomer, whereas the opposite was true for narirutin. Lemon juices contained eriocitrin stereoisomers in equal amount (50% each), but hesperidin was almost exclusively found as the 2S isomer. Significant differences of the diastereomeric ratios were observed between freshly squeezed juices and juices from commercial sources.","61.0"
"Processing of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and sorghum products alters procyanidin oligomer and polymer distribution and content","12926907.0","Sorghum procyanidins were characterized and quantified from two brown sorghum varieties and their processed products by normal phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. The DP of the procyanidins was determined by thiolysis. Quantification was done by using purified oligomeric and polymeric cocoa procyanidins as external standards. Sorghum procyanidins were composed mostly of high MW (DP > 10) polymers. Significant differences were observed in levels as well as distribution of the different MW procyanidins between the sorghums. Processing of the sorghum brans into cookies and bread significantly reduced the levels of procyanidins; this effect was more pronounced in the higher MW polymers. Cookies had a higher retention of procyanidins (42-84%) than bread (13-69%). Extrusion of sorghum grain resulted in an increase in the levels of procyanidin oligomers with DP </= 4 and decrease in polymers with DP >/= 6. This suggests a possible breakdown of the high MW polymers to the lower MW constituents during extrusion. Processing changes not only the content of procyanidins in sorghum products but also the relative ratio of the different molecular weights.","62.0"
"Cocoa powder enhances the level of antioxidative activity in rat plasma","11177180.0","The aims of the present study were to determine the level of (-)-epicatechin (EC) and its metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of cocoa powder and to evaluate the protective effect of cocoa powder in terms of suppressing the oxidation of plasma components. Rats were orally administered 1 g cocoa powder/kg body weight, containing 7.80 mg EC, and their blood was collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. The EC and its metabolites in plasma were treated with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase, then analysed by HPLC and by liquid chromatography-MS. Several EC-related compounds were detected in plasma such as free EC, and glucuronide, sulfate, and glucuronide-sulfate conjugates of non-methylated or methylated EC. All EC metabolites showed a maximum concentration in plasma at 30-60 min post-administration. Glucuronide conjugates of both non-methylated and methylated EC were found in high concentration in plasma. Moreover, administration of cocoa powder significantly reduced the accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma and significantly reduced the consumption of alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with 2,2'-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH (25 mmol/l)) or CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l) compared with that in the case of plasma obtained before administration. The total EC concentration in plasma was negatively correlated with the level of accumulation of lipid peroxides in plasma oxidized by treatment with AAPH (25 mmol/l) and was positively correlated with the level of residual alpha-tocopherol in plasma oxidized by treatment with CuSO(4) (100 micromol/l). These results indicate that EC in cocoa powder was absorbed from the digestive tract, that various conjugated forms of EC were generated in the digestive tract and distributed to the plasma, and that these enhanced the antioxidative activity of plasma.","63.0"
"Absorption and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin after administration of different levels of cocoa powder or (-)-epicatechin in rats","11743807.0","(-)-Epicatechin is a major polyphenol component of cocoa powder. The absorption and urinary excretion of (-)-epicatechin following administration of different levels of either cocoa powder (150, 750, and 1500 mg/kg) or (-)-epicatechin (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg) were evaluated in rats. Both the sum of plasma (-)-epicatechin metabolites at 1 h postadministration and peak plasma concentrations increased in a dose-dependent fashion. The sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in urine, excreted within 18 h postadministration, also increased with dose. Moreover, the sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine reached the same level in both (-)-epicatechin and cocoa powder administration groups for equivalent amounts of (-)-epicatechin. These results suggest that, in the dose range examined in this study, bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin following administration of either (-)-epicatechin or cocoa powder shows dose dependence and that the various compounds present in cocoa powder have little effect on the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin in cocoa powder.","64.0"
"In vivo comparison of the bioavailability of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their mixture in orally administered rats","11694613.0","We compared levels of (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, and their metabolites in rat plasma and urine after oral administration. Rats were divided into four groups and given (+)-catechin (CA group), (-)-epicatechin (EC group), a mixture of the two (MIX group) or deionized water. Blood samples were collected before administration and at designated time intervals thereafter. Urine samples were collected 0-24 h postadministration. (+)-Catechin, (-)-epicatechin and their metabolites in plasma and urine were analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry after treatment with beta-glucuronidase and/or sulfatase. After administration, absorbed (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were mainly present in plasma as metabolites, such as nonmethylated or 3'-O-methylated conjugates. In the CA and MIX groups, the primary metabolite of (+)-catechin in plasma was glucuronide in the nonmethylated form. In the EC and MIX groups, in contrast, the primary metabolites of (-)-epicatechin in plasma were glucuronide and sulfoglucuronide in nonmethylated forms, and sulfate in the 3'-O-methylated forms. Urinary excretion of the total amount of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the EC group was significantly higher than the amount of (+)-catechin metabolites in the CA group. The sum of (+)-catechin metabolites in the urine was significantly lower in the MIX group than in the CA group, and the sum of (-)-epicatechin metabolites in the MIX group was also significantly lower than in the EC group. These results suggest that the bioavailability of (-)-epicatechin is higher than that of (+)-catechin in rats, and that, in combination, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin might be absorbed competitively in the gastrointestinal tract of rats.","65.0"

"Orally administered rosmarinic acid is present as the conjugated and/or methylated forms in plasma, and is degraded and metabolized to conjugated forms of caffeic acid, ferulic acid and m-coumaric aci","","Rosmarinic acid (RA) is contained in various Lamiaceae herbs used commonly as culinary herbs. Although RA has various potent physiological actions, little is known on its bioavailability. We therefore investigated the absorption and metabolism of orally administered RA in rats. After being deprived of food for 12 h, RA (50 mg/kg body weight) or deionized water was administered orally to rats. Blood samples were collected from a cannula inserted in the femoral artery before and at designated time intervals after administration of RA. Urine excreted within 0 to 8 h and 8 to 18 h post-administration was also collected. RA and its related metabolites in plasma and urine were measured by LC-MS after treatment with sulfatase and/or beta-glucuronidase. RA, mono-methylated RA (methyl-RA) and m-coumaric acid (COA) were detected in plasma, with peak concentrations being reached at 0.5, 1 and 8 h after RA administration, respectively. RA, methyl-RA, caffeic acid (CAA), ferulic acid (FA) and COA were detected in urine after RA administration. These components in plasma and urine were present predominantly as conjugated forms such as glucuronide or sulfate. The percentage of the original oral dose of RA excreted in the urine within 18 h of administration as free and conjugated forms was 0.44 +/- 0.21% for RA, 1.60 +/- 0.74% for methyl-RA, 1.06 +/- 0.35% for CAA, 1.70 +/- 0.45% for FA and 0.67 +/- 0.29% for COA. Approximately 83% of the total amount of these metabolites was excreted in the period 8 to 18 h after RA administration.

"Total phenol, flavonoid, proanthocyanidin and vitamin C levels and antioxidant activities of Mauritian vegetables","","Ten Mauritian vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower, white cabbage, lettuce, Chinese cabbage, mugwort, carrot, onion, tomato and chilli pepper, were analysed for their total phenol, flavonoid, proanthocyanidin and vitamin C contents and antioxidant capacity. Antioxidant activities of the vegetables ranged from 0.43 to 3.68 µmol g−1 fresh weight Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and from 0.60 to 8.47 µmol g−1 fresh weight ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Levels of total phenols in the vegetables varied between 132 and 1189 µg g−1 fresh weight and those of total flavonoids between 45 and 944 µg g−1 fresh weight, while proanthocyanidins were detected at very low levels in only a few vegetables. Vitamin C contents varied between 25 and 748 µg g−1 fresh weight. Quercetin was the dominant flavonoid aglycone in the hydrolysed vegetable extracts, with values in the range of 15–390 µg g−1 fresh weight. There were strong correlations between antioxidant capacity and total phenols (TEAC, r = 0.91; FRAP, r = 0.83) and total flavonoids (TEAC, r = 0.89; FRAP, r = 0.82). Vitamin C contents showed poor correlation with TEAC values (r = 0.33), while no correlation was observed with FRAP values. Highest antioxidant capacities were observed in Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis L), onion (Allium cepa L), mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris Cantley) and broccoli (Brassica oleracea L var botrytis L subvar cymosa). Mauritian vegetables therefore represent a significant source of phenolic antioxidants, with quercetin derivatives being most abundant, and this may contribute to their potential health benefits.","71.0"

Trichothecene (TCT) production was highest on degermed grain, less on whole grain, and very low or nondetectable on the germ; similar results were found with four different strains. It was concluded that inhibitor(s) of TCT biosynthesis were present in maize germ. The presence of phenolic compounds was investigated in the different fractions. The hydroxamate 4-acetylbenzoxazolin-2-one (4-ABOA), a known inhibitor of mycotoxin production, was found in the degermed and whole grain fractions but not in the germ. Therefore, the TCT inhibition observed on the maize germ fraction used in our study is clearly not linked to 4-ABOA. Other soluble phenolic compounds were found at a much higher concentration in the germ than in the two other fractions. The inhibition property of the soluble ester-bound extracts was tested in liquid culture. A possible role for these compounds is discussed.","77.0"
"Strawberry juice colour: a study of the quantitative and qualitative pigment composition of juices from 39 genotypes","","The juices from 39 strawberry genotypes were analysed for anthocyanin composition and colour characteristics. No single cultivar or breeding line possessed the innate pigment characteristics thought to confer greater colour stability on strawberry juices but the anthocyanin patterns were far more complex than hitherto reported in strawberries. Thirteen different peaks were observed during high-performance liquid chromatography of the juices and tentative identifications are proposed for two previously unidentified strawberry anthocyanins. The occurrence of pelargonidin 3-rutinoside was confirmed. Colour quality measurements derived from CIELAB L*a*b* values are reported for the fresh juices.","78.0"
"Black currant polyphenols: Their storage stability and microencapsulation","","Interest in the consumption of fresh fruits is, to a large extent, due to its content of bioactive nutrients and their importance as dietary antioxidants. There is a growing demand for delivery of antioxidants through functional foods with the related challenge of protecting their bioactivity during food processing and subsequent passage through the gastrointestinal tract. This study focuses on the evaluation of concentration of bioactive compounds in black currant berries (Ribes nigrum L.) and retention of black currant polyphenol compounds and their antioxidant activity after microencapsulation by spray-drying. The polyphenol contents and antioxidant activities were assessed for 5 black currant cultivars grown in Canada in fresh and stored fruits at −20 °C for 9 months. The Ben Alder cultivar was the richest in anthocyanins and flavonols content with high antioxidant potential measured with ABTS and DPPH radicals (4.5 and 2.4 mM/100 g). Black currant polyphenols were stable during 9 month of storage at −20 °C. The results of this study indicated that in black currants storage did not affect negatively the antioxidant capacity. The good stability of bioactive compounds of black currants during freezer storage allows prolonging the storage time of these berries. Maltodextrins with different DE (dextrose equivalent): DE11, DE18, DE21 and inulin were selected as wall material. The stability of encapsulated polyphenols during 12 months storage at 8 °C and 25 °C was evaluated. Compared to maltodextrins DE18 and DE21, maltodextrin DE11 had not only higher drying yield but also offered better protection for phenolics during storage. Radical scavenging activity studies demonstrated significant antioxidant activity of microencapsulated powders before and after storage. The black currant polyphenol microcapsules described in this study represent a promising food additive for incorporation into functional foods due to antioxidant content.","79.0"
"Antioxidant activity of tocopherols and phenolic compounds of virgin olive oil","","The antioxidant effects of hydrophilic phenols and tocopherols on the oxidative stability in virgin olive oils and in purified olive oil have been evaluated. Total hydrophilic phenols and the oleosidic forms of 3,4-dihydroxyphenolethanol (3,4-DHPEA) were correlated (r=0.97) with the oxidative stability of virgin olive oil. On the contrary, tocopherols showed low correlation (r=0.05). Purified olive oil with the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to 3,4-DHPEA, an isomer of oleuropeine aglycon, and 3,4-DHPEA had good oxidative stability.

"Changes in total phenolic and flavonoid contents of rowanberry fruit during postharvest storage","","Postharvest storage conditions of rowanberry (Sorbus aucuparia) fruits were investigated. The influences of temperature and storage time on total phenolic content were observed. Both variables affected phenolic content of rowanberries, and their total phenolic contents significantly reduced during the 20-day storage at 4 and 22C. The loss of total phenolic was found to be almost 50% of its initial amount (3,619.8 mg/kg fresh weight [fw]) at 22C, which was higher than occurred loss (30%) at 4C. An investigation of rowanberry flavonoids showed the presence of rutin, quercetin-3-glucoside and quercetin-3-D-galactoside (Q3DG). Quantitative analysis of berry flavonoids showed Q3DG as a major compound, being 24.55 mg/kg fw. The highest reduction (86% of its initial amount) was also seen in that compound level compared with other ones. Degradation kinetics of flavonoids was studied at 22C over 16 days of storage. Checking of model adequacies indicated that their reductions followed a first-order kinetic.","81.0"

"Preliminary screening of antioxidant activity of some plant extracts in rapeseed oil","","The antioxidant activity (AA) of acetone extracts of sage (Salvia officinalis L.), sweet grass (Hierocloë odorata Wahlnb.), sea buckthorn leaves (Hipophaë rhamnoı̈des L.), costmary (Balsamita major Desf., syn. Chrysanthemum balsamita L.), Roman camomile (Anthemis nobilis L.), and tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) were tested in refined, bleached and deodorised rapeseed oil at 40°C. The concentrations of the extracts added were in the range from 0.02 to 0.20% (w/w). The rate of oxidation was assessed by the measurement of peroxide value (PV) and calculation of such characteristics as induction period (IP), when PV reaches 20 meq kg−1, protection factor (PF), which is the ratio of IP of the sample with additive with IP of the sample without additive, and AA (the ratio of IP increase of the sample with extract with the IP increase of the sample with butylated hydroxytoluene). Sage and sweet grass extracts were found to be most effective in stabilising rapeseed oil, followed by tansy, Roman camomile, costmary and sea buckthorn in a decreasing order. The IP of rapeseed oil increased with extract concentration. AA's of the extracts added at different concentrations were the following: sage, sweet grass (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2%) and tansy (0.2%) — very high, (PF>3); tansy and Roman camomile (0.1%) — medium (PF=2–2.5), tansy (0.05%), Roman camomile (0.02 and 0.05%) and sea buckthorn (0.1 and 0.2%) — low (PF=1.5–2.0), tansy (0.02%) — very low (PF=1.0–1.5).

"Total Phenolic, Phenolic Acid, Anthocyanin, Flavan-3-ol, and flavonol profile and antioxidant properties of pinto and black","","The effects of boiling and steaming processes at atmospheric and high pressures on the phenolic components and antioxidant properties of pinto and black beans were investigated. In comparison to the original raw beans, all processing methods caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), condensed tannin content (CTC), monomeric anthocyanin content (MAC), DPPH free-radical scavenging activity (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) values in both pinto and black beans. Steaming processing resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC values than the boiling processes in both pinto and black beans. To further investigate how thermal processing affected phenolic compositions and to elucidate the contribution of individual phenolic compounds to antioxidant properties, phenolic acids, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols were quantitatively analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All thermal processing significantly (p < 0.05) affected individual phenolic acids, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total phenolic acid contents in both pinto and black beans and total flavonol contents in pinto beans, and dramatically reduced anthocyanin contents in black beans. Phenolic acids and flavonols may play important roles on the overall antioxidant activities of pinto beans, while anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols, and flavonols may play important roles on the overall antioxidant activities of black beans.","84.0"

"Phenolic constituents levels in cv. Agria potato under microwave processing","","Phenolic compounds have long been associated with flavour and colour characteristics of fruits and vegetables and actually attract a great interest due to their health protecting properties. In this work, the influence of different power input of microwave baking on the amount of protocatechuic acid (1), tryptophan (2), chlorogenic acid (3), neo-chlorogenic acid (4), and cryptochlorogenic acid (5) marker compounds left over in peeled and not-peeled potatoes (Solanum tuberosus L., Agria cultivar) was assessed. A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with diode-array detection (DAD) was used to identify and quantify compounds 1–5. Other tubers were used to perform analysis of raw potato (control) and traditional baking potatoes products (boiled potatoes). Dielectric behavior of the irradiated tubers was also investigated to emphasize if microwaves treatments are suitable for food processing in terms of nutritional factor preservation. The main results of this work consist on the relevance of the water contents in potato matrixes during the baking processes since these have a crucial role to keep lossy features, to avoid thermal damages and to preserve antioxidant. The best compromise in terms of short baking time and reduced water and phenolic losses is obtained using 500 W as power input.","87.0"
"Physicochemical and nutritional characteristics of blueberry juice after high pressure processing","","This study was carried out to investigate the impact of high pressure processing (HPP) at different pressure (200, 400 and 600 MPa) and treatment times (5, 9 and 15 min) on ascorbic acid, total phenolics, anthocyanin stability and total antioxidant capacity, were also studied at different physicochemical parameters such as pH, °Brix and color. HPP treatments resulted in more than 92% vitamin C retention at all treatment intensities. On the other hand, total phenolic content in the juice was increased, mainly after HPP at 200 MPa for all treatment times. The total and monomeric anthocyanin were similar or higher than the value estimated for the fresh juice being maximum at 400 MPa/15 min (16% increase). Antioxidant capacity values were not statistically different for treatments at 200 MPa for 5–15 min in comparison with fresh juice, however for 400 MPa/15 min and 600 MPa for all times (8–16% reduction), the lowest values were observed for total antioxidant capacity determined with TEAC method.

"Evaluation of quality changes of blueberry juice during refrigerated storage after high-pressure and pulsed electric fields processing","","A better knowledge of the effect of refrigerated storage on the nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of foods processed by emerging technologies with regard to unprocessed juices is necessary. Thus, blueberry juice was processed by high pressure (HP) (600 MPa/42 °C/5 min) and pulsed electric fields (PEF) (36 kV/cm, 100 μs). The stability of physicochemical parameters, antioxidant compounds (ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total anthocyanins) and antioxidant capacity was studied just after treatment and during 56 days at refrigerated storage at 4 °C. Just after treatment, all treated blueberry juices showed a decrease lower than 5% in ascorbic acid content compared with the untreated one. At the end of refrigerated storage, unprocessed and PEF juices showed similar ascorbic acid losses (50%) in relation to untreated juice, although HP juices maintained better the ascorbic acid content during storage time (31% losses). All juices exhibited fluctuations in total phenolic values with a marked decrease after 7 days in refrigerated storage, however prolonged storage of the juices at 4 °C, up to 56 days resulted in another in the total phenolic content for all juices in comparison with day 7. HP preserved antioxidant activity (21% losses) more than unprocessed (30%) and PEF (48%) juices after 56 days at 4 °C. Color changes (a*, b*, L, Chroma, hº and ΔE) were slightly noticeable after refrigerated storage for all juices.","89.0"

"Changes in phenolic compounds and browning during biological aging of sherry-type wine","","Contents of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxycinnamic esters, and monomeric and dimeric derivatives of flavan-3-ol during biological aging of dry pale sherry white wine were measured and compared between wine without aging and wines in five different stages of aging. The results show a significant decrease in the levels of vanillic and ferulic acids, catechin, epicatechin and procyanidins B2 and B4, as well as an increase in those of syringic acid and procyanidin B1. According to the changes observed in polyphenol contents and the absorbance data obtained at 420 nm, sherry-type wines seem to be protected from excessive browning during biological aging mainly as a result of the partial removal of flavan-3-ol derivatives, besides the effect of protection from air contact carried out by the flor yeasts growing on the wine surface.","91.0"

"Changes in phenolic compounds in lentils (Lens culinaris) during germination and fermentation","","Germination and fermentation have been proposed to improve the nutritive value of legumes. This paper reports the changes that occur in phenolic compounds in lentils (Lens culinaris var. vulgaris) during germination and fermentation. Levels of low-molecular-weight phenolic compounds (benzoic acids and aldehydes, hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, flavan-3-ols and procyanidins) were determined. Germination did not appreciably vary the content of phenolic compounds, although important structural changes in procyanidin-type compounds were observed. Fermentation led to a general increase in the content of phenolic compounds. Gentisic acid, p-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, tryptophol and three other unknown compounds were detected in fermented lentils, but not in raw lentils.

"Evaluation of fruit quality in peach and apricot","","The fruits of nine white-fleshed and three yellow-fleshed peaches, one white-fleshed nectarine and five apricot cultivars were compared as to chemical composition and sensory evaluation. Three acids (succinic, malic and citric) and eight sugars (xylitol, fructose, glucose, mannose, sorbitol, inositol, sucrose and maltose) were identified. The total amount (mg/100g FW) of acids ranged from 300 to 1,500 in peach and from 2,900 to 4,600 in apricot. The total amount of sugars ranged from 6,700 to 12,500 and from 7,400 to 10,800 for peach and apricot respectively. Total phenolics were very variable, ranging from an average of 30 mg/100g FW in the yellow-fleshed peaches to values two-seven fold higher in the white ones and from 27 to 91 in apricots. According to the sensory and chemical evaluations conducted in this study, acceptable or good flavor should match the following composition (mg/100g FW). Peach: 1,000-1,600 organic acids, 8,500-13,000 alcoholsoluble sugars, 7.8-8.5 acid-sugar ratio; less than 80-90 phenolics. Apricot: 3,500-4,500 organic acids, 10-12,000 sugars, 2-3.5 sugar/acid ratio, less than 60 phenolics.

"Disposition and biotransformation of the estrogenic isoflavone daidzein in rats","11452132.0","Daidzein is an estrogenic isoflavone present in many plants and therefore consumed in relatively high doses by humans. Daidzein has a low affinity for the estrogen receptor (3 orders of magnitude lower than estradiol) and has been demonstrated to have estrogenic effects in rodents after administration of high doses. We have studied the disposition and biotransformation of daidzein in rats fed a diet low in isoflavone content. Four male and four female Fischer 344 rats were orally administered 100 mg/kg daidzein; excreted urine and feces were collected for 96 h and unchanged daidzein as well as formed metabolites were quantified by HPLC. In urine of male rats, daidzein, daidzein-glucuronide, and daidzein-sulfate were excreted; in females, only unchanged daidzein and daidzein-glucuronide were present. Total urinary excretion of daidzein accounted for < 10% of dose in both males and females. The major pathway of daidzein elimination was excretion of unchanged daidzein with feces. Reductive daidzein-metabolites likely formed by intestinal microflora (equol, O-desmethylangolensin) were excreted with feces in small amounts (< 5% of dose). Excretion of daidzein and metabolites with urine and feces was rapid with elimination half-lives of less than 12 h; daidzein concentrations in urine and feces were below the limit of detection 36 h after daidzein administration. The results suggest that daidzein is only poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in rodents. Absorbed daidzein is rapidly eliminated both unchanged and as conjugates with urine. The inefficient absorption of daidzein from the gastrointestinal tract and the rapid excretion may explain the weak estrogenicity of daidzein seen in vivo in rodents when compared to other estrogenic chemicals with comparatively low affinity to the estrogen receptor.","98.0"

"Determination of green and black tea composition by capillary electrophoresis","","Despite the fact that mankind has been drinking tea for more than 5000 years, its chemical composition has been studied only in recent decades. These studies are primarily carried out using chromatographic methods. This review summarizes the latest information regarding the chemical composition of different tea grades by different chromatographic methods, which has not previously been reviewed in the same scope. Over the last 40 years, the qualitative and quantitative analyses of high volatile compounds were determined by GC and GC/MS. The main components responsible for aroma of green and black tea were revealed, and the low volatile compounds basically were determined by HPLC and LC/MS methods. Most studies focusing on the determination of catechins and caffeine in various teas (green, oolong, black and pu-erh) involved HPLC analysis. Knowledge of tea chemical composition helps in assessing its quality on the one hand, and helps to monitor and manage its growing, processing, and storage conditions on the other. In particular, this knowledge has enabled to establish the relationships between the chemical composition of tea and its properties by identifying the tea constituents which determine its aroma and taste. Therefore, assessment of tea quality does not only rely on subjective organoleptic evaluation, but also on objective physical and chemical methods, with extra determination of tea components most beneficial to human health. With this knowledge, the nutritional value of tea may be increased, and tea quality improved by providing via optimization of the growing, processing, and storage conditions.","102.0"

Tannic acid is then determined in a beer ethyl acetate extract by quantitative chromatography of its gallic and digallic acid components. Because endogenous digallic acid has not been reported in beer, determination of this component in beer confirms the presence of tannic acid and its use in beer processing. The HPLC method offers an alternative to the TLC method and can be used to confirm TLC results.","107.0"
"HPLC analysis of chlorogenic acid lactones in roasted coffee","","The identification of 3- (3-CQL) and 4-caffeoylquinic acid-γ-lactone (4-CQL) in roasted coffee is described. The lactones were separated from chlorogenic acids (CQA) by an isocratic reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC system and identified as caffeic acid derivatives using their ultraviolet spectra obtained on the fly with an diode array detector. Thermospray liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry spectra (discharge ionisation, buffer ionisation) showed the quasi molecule ion and characteristic fragments (e.g. caffeic acid, quinide). The lactones were isolated from coffee by polyamide column chromatography followed by RP-HPLC on a semipreparative scale, and structures assigned using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and various nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. There seems to be an equilibrium between the two lactones: isolation of 3-CQL and 4-CQL under the experimental conditions used yielded both lactones in the final product. The content of the caffeoylquinides in commercial coffee samples ranged from 1.5 to 3.5 g/kg dry matter.","108.0"
"Polyphenols, anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, and radical scavenging activity of Rubus, Ribes, and Aronia","","Total polyphenols, total anthocyanins, and reduced ascorbic acid were evaluated in berries belonging to the genera Rubus, Ribes, and Aronia by means of spectrophotometric and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the fruit extracts was tested. Total polyphenols ranged from 140.6 to 888.5 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), total anthocyanins ranged from 22.0 to 460.5 mg/100 g FW, and reduced ascorbic acid ranged from 12.4 to 153.8 mg/ 100 g FW. The average EC50 values for Aronia melanocarpa, Ribes nigrum, Ribes rubrum, Rubus fruticosus, and Rubus idaeus were 1.8, 2.8, 5.3, 6.4, and 8.2 mg FW, respectively. The results indicate that the fruits tested are good sources of natural antioxidants.","109.0"
"Flavonoids in baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.): changes during plant growth and storage","16302762.0","The variation in flavonoid concentration and composition was investigated in baby spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) cv. Emilia sown on three occasions, each harvested at three growth stages at 6-day intervals. After harvest, leaves were stored in polypropylene bags at 2 or 10 degrees C. Flavonoids were analyzed by reversed phase HPLC. Twelve flavonoid peaks were detected. The main flavonoid, making up on average 43% of the total flavonoid concentration, was identified as 5,3',4'-trihydroxy-3-methoxy-6:7-methylenedioxyflavone-4'-glucuronide. Four other flavonoids each contributed 7-12% of the total flavonoid content. Total flavonoid content was relatively stable during normal retail storage conditions, although some of the individual flavonoid compounds showed considerable variation. The youngest plants had the highest flavonoid concentration, indicating that by harvesting the baby spinach a few days earlier than the current commercial stage of harvest, the flavonoid concentration in the product may be increased and the content of potentially health-promoting compounds enhanced.","110.0"

"Phenolic compounds and kernel characteristics of Zimbabwean sorghums","","Sixteen sorghum varieties widely cultivated in Zimbabwe were examined for levels of phenolic compounds and kernel characteristics, to help identify those with desirable properties and develop suitable processing methods. Assays for polyphenols included the chlorox test, the vanillin-HCl, the ferric ammonium citrate and the butanol-HCl methods. Free phenolic acids were analysed using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Varieties DC-75, Mutode and Chirmaugute had the highest levels of condensed tannins. The polyphenols in Chibonda were mostly unextractable in methanol. No significant levels of polyphenols were found in 13 varieties. Phenolic acid content was related to pericarp colour. Endosperm texture and pericarp thickness were evaluated using video image analysis. Katandanzara and SV1 had relatively corneous endosperms (<30% floury). Mutode, Chibonda and DC-75 had thick pericarps (>0.060 mm). Endosperm texture was not correlated with phenolic compounds. A positive correlation, however, was observed between pericarp thickness and polyphenol content (r > 0.64). Zimbabwean sorghums lack ideal agronomic and processing physico-chemical characteristics defined in terms of high polyphenols, plus hard endosperm and thin pericarp. Research is required to develop effective methods to process the available polyphenol-rich sorghums.","112.0"
"Phenolics in white free run juices and wines from Penedes by high-performance liquid chromatography: changes during vinification","","A precise and sensitive HPLC method, with diode array detection, for phenolic compounds in white juices and wines is presented. Eighteen of these phenolics have been identified and quantitated in white free run juices and 19 in white wines. Identification of benzoic acids was confirmed by GC/MS. The only flavonol detected, quercetin 3-glucuronide, was identified by TLC and electrospray (ESI) techniques. Levels of the trans- and cis-hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonoids, and benzoic acids present in white juice and wine are reported. Hydroxycinnamates were the major phenols; among them, trans-caftaric, trans-coutaric, and cis-coutaric were the predominant. The cis-coutaric represented a substantial percentage in the total amount of phenols. Flavonoids were present at low concentration, and benzoic acids were the minor compounds. During white vinification, a significant decrease in the phenolic compounds present in free run juice was observed, mainly caused by the hydroxycinnamic acids.","113.0"
"Biophenolic components of olives","","The occurrence of biophenolic components in olives provides functional value to the Mediterranean food culture, owing to recognized antioxidant activities of these substances. The concentration of biophenolic compounds in olives are closely linked to texture and organoleptic characteristics of agrifood products, i.e. table olive and olive oil. The concentrations of different biophenolic compounds in olives were investigated in order to develop appropriate procedures for determination of these compounds in fresh and processed table olives and in the olive drupes for olive oil production. Olives from Spain (Hojiblanca cv), Portugal (Douro cv), Greece (Thasos and Conservolia cvs) and Italy (Taggiasca and Cassanese cvs) were analysed. Four different protocols were employed. The first allows for an estimate of the total concentration of simple biophenolic compounds; the second, for soluble compounds and soluble esterified derivatives of these compounds; the third, the qualitative determination of cytoplasmatic soluble biophenolic content; the fourth, determination of soluble, glucosidic, esterified and cell-wall bound biophenols by means of a rapid, though more complex, sequential method, for their accurate evaluation on a structural and quantitative basis. Thus, the experimental procedures yield four different fractions of the biophenolic components of the olive, checked by CC, HPLC and NMR. The experimental results depend on the procedure chosen, the degree of ripeness of the olives, and the environment of the olive cultivars. The composition of each of these fractions can be of valuable information, supporting for table olive growing and olive oil producers in maximising the competitive quality of their products by selecting olive materials whose concentrations of biophenolic compounds can be responsible for beneficial effects on human health.","114.0"
"The occurrence in olive oil of a new class of phenolic compounds: hydroxy-isochromans","","A new class of phenolic compounds, hydroxy-isochromans, was found in different samples of extra-virgin olive oil. In particular, the presence of l-phenyl-6,7-dihydroxy-isochroman, 10 and 1-(3′-methoxy-4′-hydroxy)phenyl-6,7-dihydroxy-isochroman, 11 was demonstrated by comparison of the high performance liquid chromatography–mass/mass (HPLC–MS/MS) spectra of biophenolic samples from extra-virgin olive oils with those of compounds obtained by a reaction between hydroxytyrosol and the aromatic aldehydes, benzaldehyde and vanillin, respectively.","115.0"
"Analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of biophenolic compounds in olives and vegetation waters, part 1","","Biophenolic compounds constitute a complex mixture in olives and derived products. In this work, ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography is applied to the identification and quantification of biophenols present in complex matrices such as olives and vegetation waters. The extraction and purification method for the biophenol present in both the matrices is reported. Using this approach the main biophenols found, in three different variety of olives, were: tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleoside methyl ester, oleoside dimethyl ester, and oleuropein. In vegetation water the biophenols are present in lower amounts than in olives.","116.0"
"Analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of biophenolic compounds in virgin olive oil, part II","","In this study the qualitative and quantitative content of the biophenolics in virgin olive oils is evaluated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The extraction and purification method for these compounds from virgin oils was optimised. After liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction the separation of 35 of these compounds was achieved on reversed phase in gradient mode. The detection was preliminarily by UV and fluorescence, but then the final choice was ion-spray tandem mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode in negative ionization, acquiring two diagnostic product ions from the chosen precursor [M—H]–. Using this last approach we obtained the best sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity. The recovery of the method ranged from 70–90% and detection limits were less than 1 ng for all the analyzed compounds.","117.0"

Different commercial starting materials, such as fruit (unbroken and crushed), four herbal teas, and two instant herbal teas were evaluated. Chlorogenic acid (1), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2), p-anisaldehyde (3), and trans-anethole (4) were identified by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS as constituents of fennel teas. No coumarins, which are characteristic constituents of plants of Apiaceae family, were found. Trans-anethole (4), the main constituent of the essential oil, was present in all teas. In addition p-anisaldehyde (3), a degradation product of trans-anethole, was also identified in all teas with the exception of two samples. Chlorogenic acid (1) and quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide (2) were also present in all teas. In addition, minor unidentified flavonol constituents were found in two teas.

"Distribution of quercetin and kaempferol in lettuce, kale, chive, garlic chive, leek, horseradish, red radish, and red cabbage tissues","","The quercetin and kaempferol contents of 13 varieties of lettuce were determined. Leaf lettuce varieties contained 2-54 mg of quercetin/kg, while head lettuce varieties contained 1-28 mg/kg, more in the outer leaves than in the inner leaves. These samples also contained 0-2 mg of kaempferol/kg. Chives contained 55 mg of kaempferol and 9 mg of quercetin per kg in green proteins and lesser amounts in white portions, while leek contained 20 mg of kaempferol/kg in green portions and no detectable quercetin in either portion. Two varieties of kale contained 7-20 mg of quercetin and 13-30 mg of kaempferol per kg. Other vegetables examined contained lesser amounts of these flavonols. No myricetin was detected in these samples.","119.0"

"Effect of domestic processing and cooking methods on phytic acid and polyphenol contents of pea cultivars (Pisum sativum)","7971780.0","All the pea varieties differed significantly (p < 0.05) in their phytic acid content. The field pea cultivars had significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of phytic acid and polyphenols than those of vegetable pea varieties. All the domestic processing and cooking methods could reduce the contents of phytic acid and polyphenols but germination for 48 hours seemed to have a marked lowering effect on the levels of these antinutrients in peas.","121.0"
"Effect of processing on nutritional and antinutritional factors of moongbean cultivars","","Ordinary cooking of presoaked and unsoaked seeds of six cultivars of moongbean (Vigna radiata L.) lowered phytic acid, polyphenols, trypsin inhibitors and improved in vitro digestibility of protein and starch, and availability of Ca, Fe and Zn when compared to unprocessed seeds. However, the effect was more pronounced on ordinary cooking of presoaked seeds followed by cooking of unsoaked seeds and presoaked seeds alone. A significant increase in vitro digestibility of protein (34–48%), and starch (31–62%) may be ascribed to the reduced content of phytic acid (45–65%) polyphenols (34–70%) and trypsin inhibitor activity (42–55%) after ordinary cooking of presoaked seeds of moongbean cultivars. Therefore, ordinary cooking of soaked seeds was the most effective treatment in improving the nutritional quality of moongbean.","122.0"
"Biophenols in table olives","12059143.0","Unprocessed olives are well-known sources of phenolic antioxidants with important biological properties. Processing methods to prepare table olives may cause a reduction of valuable phenols and may deprive the food of precious biological functions. The present work was undertaken to evaluate table olives produced in Greece as sources of biophenols. Commercially available olives were analyzed for their total phenol content by using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and for individual phenols by RP-HPLC. Samples were Spanish-style green olives in brine, Greek-style naturally black olives in brine, and Kalamata olives in brine. Most of the types of olives analyzed were found to be good sources of phenols. Hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and luteolin were the prevailing phenols in almost all of the samples examined. High levels of hydroxytyrosol were determined mainly in Kalamata olives and Spanish-style green olives, cultivar Chalkidiki (250-760 mg/kg).","123.0"
"Effect of processing on antioxidant contents in selected dry beans (Phaseolus spp. L.)","","Dry beans are rich sources of dietary fiber and phytochemicals such as flavonoids and phenolics. In the current study, we determined the effects of two processing methods (soaking and toasting) on total phenolics, flavonoids, proanthocyanidin and antioxidant potential by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity and ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) in selected dry beans (red kidney beans (K), black-eyed peas (B), pinto beans (P) and soy beans (S)). Total phenolics (mg/g dwb) expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE), total flavonoids (mg/g dwb) as catechin equivalents (CE) and proanthocyanidin expressed as leucocyanidin equivalent (mg LE/g) ranged from 3.42 to 7.21, 0.61 to 0.84 and 0.51 to 3.13 in raw beans; 3.58 to 6.94, 0.19 to 0.99 and 0.43 to 3.13 in soaked beans and 4.55 to 9.52, 0.23 to1.00 and 0.20 to 3.25 in toasted beans, respectively. FRAP (μg/g) in raw, soaked and toasted dry beans ranged from 0.00097 to 0.00424 while DPPH(T30) (%) ranged from 43.9 to 62.61. Our results indicate that processing methods (soaking and roasting) influenced total phenolic, flavonoid and antioxidant contents (DPPH, FRAP) in selected dry beans.","124.0"
"Mangiferin and hesperidin metabolites are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of pigs after oral ingestion of a Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush tea) extract","19083501.0","Health-promoting properties such as antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and cholesterol-lowering effects are described for mangiferin and hesperidin, the major phenolic compounds present in Cyclopia genistoides (honeybush). However, knowledge of their metabolic fate and their absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of mangiferin, hesperidin, and their metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces samples from pigs consuming an extract of Cyclopia genistoides. Pigs were administered up to 74 mg mangiferin per kilogram of body weight and 1 mg hesperidin per kilogram of body weight per day for 11 days. Plasma samples were collected at various time points on days 9 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 after termination of extract administration. Urine and feces were collected in fractions for 24 hours. In the plasma samples, the aglycone of mangiferin (norathyriol) was detected. Mean plasma concentrations ranged from 7.8 to 11.8 mumol/L. Six metabolites of mangiferin and hesperidin were detected in the urine, including methyl mangiferin, norathyriol, its monoglucuronide, hesperetin, hesperetin monoglucuronide, and eriodictyol monoglucuronide. Between 26.0% and 30.8% of the administered dose of hesperidin and only between 1.4% and 1.6% of mangiferin could be detected in the urine on days 9 and 11 of the study. Approximately 8.2% of the administered dose of mangiferin was determined in the feces. The main metabolite was norathyriol. Neither hesperidin nor metabolites ascribed to hesperidin intake were detected. The results suggest that formation of norathyriol from mangiferin occurs in vivo, and specific metabolites were identified in blood and excretion products in urine and feces. This study will aid in investigating the physiological functions of the parent compounds in vivo.","125.0"

"Fast separation and determination of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol and other phenolic compounds in extra-virgin olive oil by capillary zone electrophoresis with ultraviolet-diode array detection","14518773.0","Olive oil is the main source of fat in the Mediterranean diet, and its consumption has been related to a low incidence of coronary heart disease and certain cancers. Recent findings demonstrate that olive oil phenolics are powerful in vitro and in vivo antioxidants and display other biological activities that could partially account for the observed healthful effects of the Mediterranean diet. A detailed method optimization plan was carried out to separate the most popular phenols in olive oil for four separation parameters: buffer concentration, buffer pH, applied voltage and temperature. Consequently, an analytical method capable of separating 21 different phenols and polyphenols by capillary zone electrophoresis was developed; the separation was performed within 10 min, using a 40 cm x 50 microm capillary, with a 45 mM sodium tetraborate buffer (pH 9.60), at 27 kV and 30 degrees C. The optimized method was applied to methanolic extracts of several Italian extra-virgin olive oils obtained by different technologies in order to characterize and to compare their antioxidant profile. Positive correlations of phenolic compounds found by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and two colorimetric indexes (total polyphenols and o-diphenols) were found and discussed.","128.0"
"Antioxidant phenols in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flour: comparative spectrophotometric study among extraction methods of free and bound phenolic compounds","15291496.0","Phenolic compounds are found in both free and bound forms in cereals. The majority is in the insoluble bound form, that is, bound to cell wall material, such as ferulic acid and its derivatives. The antioxidant properties of the phenolic compounds in grains are associated with the health benefits of grains and grain products. The extraction capacity of several solvent mixtures, for extracting free phenols from barley flours, and the possibility of employing a rapid automated solvent extraction method were studied. The extraction yield of each method was evaluated by correlating several spectrophotometric indices (absorption at 280, 320, and 370 nm and total phenolic compounds by the Folin-Ciocalteu method) with the antioxidant activities of the barley extracts (scavenging activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method). Interesting results were obtained when ethanol and acetone-based extraction mixtures were employed to extract free phenols. A comparison was made between alkaline and acid hydrolysis. The extraction yield of bound phenolic compounds increased when the digestion time for alkaline hydrolysis was prolonged.","129.0"
"Qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils as a function of the ripening degree of olive fruits by different analytical techniques","15537313.0","Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can be effectively used as a fast screening tool to obtain qualitative and semiquantitative information about simple and complex phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil. Three simple phenols (tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, and vanillic acid), a secoiridoid derivative (deacetoxy oleuropein aglycon), and two lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol) were detected as the main compounds in extra virgin olive oils by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Spectrophotometric indices, radical scavenging activity, and oxidative stability of extra virgin olive oil samples obtained from olives hand-picked at different ripening degrees were statistically correlated with the CZE and HPLC quantification. The concentration of phenols in extra virgin olive oil decreased with ripeness of olive fruits. The high correlations found between CZE and the other analytical results indicate that CE can be applied as a rapid and reliable tool to routinely determine phenolic compounds in extra virgin olive oils.","130.0"
"Phase I dose escalation pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers of resveratrol, a potential cancer chemopreventive agent","17548692.0","The red grape constituent resveratrol possesses cancer chemopreventive properties in rodents. The hypothesis was tested that, in healthy humans, p.o. administration of resveratrol is safe and results in measurable plasma levels of resveratrol. A phase I study of oral resveratrol (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 5 g) was conducted in 10 healthy volunteers per dose level. Resveratrol and its metabolites were identified in plasma and urine by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography-UV. Consumption of resveratrol did not cause serious adverse events. Resveratrol and six metabolites were recovered from plasma and urine. Peak plasma levels of resveratrol at the highest dose were 539 +/- 384 ng/mL (2.4 micromol/L, mean +/- SD; n = 10), which occurred 1.5 h post-dose. Peak levels of two monoglucuronides and resveratrol-3-sulfate were 3- to 8-fold higher. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) values for resveratrol-3-sulfate and resveratrol monoglucuronides were up to 23 times greater than those of resveratrol. Urinary excretion of resveratrol and its metabolites was rapid, with 77% of all urinary agent-derived species excreted within 4 h after the lowest dose. Cancer chemopreventive effects of resveratrol in cells in vitro require levels of at least 5 micromol/L. The results presented here intimate that consumption of high-dose resveratrol might be insufficient to elicit systemic levels commensurate with cancer chemopreventive efficacy. However, the high systemic levels of resveratrol conjugate metabolites suggest that their cancer chemopreventive properties warrant investigation.","131.0"

"The bioavailability of raspberry anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats","17533654.0","The fate of anthocyanins and ellagitannins in rats was monitored following ingestion of raspberry juice. After 1 h low nM concentrations of unmetabolised anthocyanins were present in plasma but these declined by 2 h and after 4 h they were no longer detectable. For the first 2 h there was an almost full recovery of anthocyanins as they passed from the stomach through the duodenum/jejunum and into the ileum. After 3 h less than 50% were recovered, and the levels declined rapidly thereafter. Excretion of raspberry anthocyanins in urine over a 24 h period was equivalent to 1.2% of the amount ingested. Trace quantities of anthocyanins were detected in the caecum, colon and faeces and they were absent in extracts of liver, kidneys and brain. Urine also contained a number of phenolic acids but most were present in quantities well in excess of the 918 nmol of anthocyanins present in the ingested juice. These findings indicate that raspberry anthocyanins per se are poorly absorbed, probably prior to reaching the ileum, and that substantial amounts pass from the small to the large intestine where they are degraded by colonic bacteria. Ellagitannins disappeared in the stomach without accumulation of ellagic acid.","133.0"
"Bioavailability of multiple components following acute ingestion of a polyphenol-rich juice drink","20521274.0","A healthy diet involves eating fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, the benefits of which are in part linked to the ingestion of bioactive compounds including polyphenols. As a convenient means of delivering additional polyphenols to the diet, a polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was prepared and the bioavailability of its diverse spectrum of constituents investigated. Ten human volunteers followed a low-flavonoid diet for 2 days before drinking 350 mL of the P-R beverage. Plasma and urine were collected for 24 h and analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS. The plasma pharmacokinetics and recoveries of urinary metabolites of flavan-3-ols, flavanones, dihydrochalcones and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both in terms of their identity and quantity, were, in most instances, not markedly different to those reported in other feeding studies with green tea, orange juice, apple cider and coffee. This indicates that the combination of polyphenolic compounds in the P-R beverage are absorbed and excreted to a similar extent whether fed individually or together in a single beverage. It is concluded that the P-R beverage can deliver the intended blend of bioavailable polyphenols, which would normally require consumption of several different plant-derived foods.","134.0"
"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic profile of table olives from the Greek market","","Five different varieties of greek table olives (Kalamon, Tsakistes, Crete, Amfissas and Thrubes Crete) were investigated for the total polyphenol content and phenolic compounds, humidity, fat and total antioxidant capacity. Analysis was performed on the flesh and kernel of the table olives. Total polyphenol content was estimated with the Folin–Ciocalteau assay, humidity with freeze drying and total fat with Soxhlet extraction. Qualitative analysis of phenols and phenolic acids was performed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and thirteen compounds were identified in flesh as well in kernel except of oleanolic acid. Finally the antioxidant activity of olives was assessed by scavenging of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPHradical dot) radical. Total antioxidant capacity is in descending order: Tsakistes > Amfissas > Kalamon > Crete > Thrubes Crete. By the present work, the consumption of table olives, is considered to offer a high intake of antioxidants, mainly polyphenols, and so a health benefit for the prevention of many decadent diseases.","135.0"
"Changes in dietary fibre, phenolic acids and activity of endogenous enzymes during rye bread-making","","The content and composition of dietary fibre (DF), phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers as well as the activity of endogenous enzymes were measured in freeze-dried samples of rye wholemeal, dough and bread during the rye bread-making process. Activities of α-amylase, β-xylosidase, α-arabinofuranosidase, and cinnamoyl esterase(s) were found in extracts of wholemeal and in dough after mixing and proofing, whereas activity of endo-xylanase was only found in the wholemeal. As a result of dough mixing, the content of total DF decreased by 21%, which was caused by a decrease in the amount of water-unextractable (WUE) DF. The content of water-extractable (WE) DF was unchanged during the bread-making process, but the relative content of WE DF increased. The content of total ester-bound phenolic acids and ferulic acid dehydrodimers decreased from 1575 µg/g in the wholemeal to 1472 µg/g in rye bread. The most pronounced effect occurred in an imitated sour dough (acidified with lactic and acetic acid instead of by lactic acid bacteria). The observed changes in content and solubility of DF in the dough could be explained by the activity of endogenous enzymes and mechanical disaggregation, whereas the changes observed in the imitated sour dough indicated that some acid hydrolysis might also have taken place.","136.0"
"Identification and quantitation of ellagic acid in muscadine grape juice","","Muscadine grape juice will occasionally produce a sediment upon standing for long time periods. In order to seek approaches to elimination of this sediment, it was necessary first to identify it and then to quantitate the material responsible. The sediment was identified through various chemical and spectrophotometric means as ellagic acid. This material could be separated, identified, and quantitated in juice by using HPLC. A simple spectrophotometric assay also sufficed for quantitation. Different juice sources contained highly variable amounts of ellagic acid.","137.0"
"Anthocyanin composition of red raspberry juice: influences of cultivar, processing, and environmental factors","","The anthocyanin and anthocyanidin pigment profiles of 46 authentic red raspberry juice samples were determined by HPLC. Total anthocyanin pigment content and percent polymeric color were also determined. This generated a database incorporating influences of cultivar, geographic origin, maturity, processing, and mold contamination. Cultivars exhibited characteristic patterns distinguished by quantitative rather than qualitative differences. Total pigment ranged from 4 to 1,102 mg/L. Commercial red raspberry juice concentrates (14) were also analyzed. Two were shown to be adulterated because of the presence of delphinidin glycosides. Three samples contained high amounts of polymerized pigments, indicating a history of processing or storage abuse.","138.0"
"Chemical composition and oxidative stability of flax, safflower and poppy seed and seed oils","18198133.0","Three seeds of Turkish origin, flax, poppy and safflower were analyzed for their proximate, fatty acids, tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) and total phenolic composition, and oxidative stability of their oil. The major fatty acid in the flax oil was alpha-linolenic acid, comprising 58.3% of total fatty acids, whereas poppy and safflower oils were rich in linoleic acid at 74.5% and 70.5% level, respectively. The amount of total tocols was 14.6 mg/100g flax, 11.0mg/100g poppy and 12.1mg/100g safflower seed. Flax and poppy oil were rich in gamma-tocopherol as 79.4 mg/100g oil and 30.9 mg/100g oil, respectively, while alpha-tocopherol (44.1g/100g oil) was dominant in safflower oil. Only alpha- and gamma-tocotrienol were found in the oils. Oxidative stability of oils was measured at 110 degrees C at the rate of 20 L/h air flow rate, and poppy oil (5.56 h) was most stabile oil followed by safflower oil (2.87 h) and flax oil (1.57). There were no correlation between oxidative stability and unsaturation degree of fatty acids and tocol levels of the oils. All of the seeds investigated provide a healthy oil profile and may have potential as a source of specialty oils on a commercial scale.","139.0"
"Avenanthramides in oats (Avena sativa) and structure-antioxidant activity relationships","12537428.0","Eight avenanthramides, amides of anthranilic acid (1) and 5-hydroxyanthranilic acid (2), respectively, and the four cinnamic acids p-coumaric (p), caffeic (c), ferulic (f), and sinapic (s) acid, were synthesized for identification in oat extracts and for structure-antioxidant activity studies. Three compounds (2p, 2c, and 2f) were found in oat extracts. As assessed by the reactivity toward 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), all avenanthramides except 1p showed activity. Initially, the antioxidant activity of the avenanthramides decreased in a similar order as for the corresponding cinnamic acids, that is: sinapic > caffeic > ferulic > p-coumaric acid. The avenanthramides derived from 2 were usually slightly more active than those derived from 1. All avenanthramides inhibited azo-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid. 1c and 1s were initially the most effective compounds. The relative order of antioxidant activities was slightly different for the DPPH and the linoleic acid assays run in methanol and chlorobenzene, respectively.","140.0"
"Absorption, conjugation and excretion of the flavanones, naringenin and hesperetin from alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice in human subjects","20100371.0","We have determined the absorption, conjugation and excretion of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside (narirutin) compared to the corresponding glucoside in an orange juice matrix in human subjects. Healthy volunteers (eight men and eight women), in a double blind, randomised, crossover study, consumed orange juice with (1) natural content of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside; (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated to yield naringenin-7-O-glucoside. Blood was sampled at twelve time points and three fractions of urine were collected over 24 h. The area under the plasma-time curve of naringenin from (2) alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice was increased about 4-fold (P < 0.0001), peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 5.4-fold higher (P < 0.0001) and Tmax was decreased from 311 to 92 min (P = 0.002) compared to untreated orange juice (1), indicating a change in absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. Furthermore, the amount in urine was increased from 7 to 47 % (P < 0.0001) of the dose after consumption of the alpha-rhamnosidase-treated orange juice (2). All urine samples contained both naringenin-7- and -4'-O-glucuronides. In addition, to examine the effect of dose and alpha-rhamnosidase treatment on hesperetin conjugate profiles, a further treatment where (3) orange juice fortified with three times the original content of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside was used. Five hesperetin metabolites (3'-O-glucuronide; 7-O-glucuronide; 5,7-O-diglucuronide; 3',7-O-diglucuronide; 3'-O-sulphate) were present after all treatments (1-3), with the same profile of the conjugates. The present data show that bioavailability of naringenin is increased by conversion from rutinoside to glucoside, but the profile of the conjugates of flavanones formed and excreted in urine is neither affected by the absorption site nor by a 3-fold change in dose.","141.0"
"Rapid and complete extraction of phenols from olive oil and determination by means of a coulometric electrode array system","11087455.0","Extraction methods to determine olive oil phenols are not exhaustive. A procedure to test their effectiveness, based on the treatment of the extracted oil with 2 N HCl followed by analysis of phenols in the aqueous phase, has been developed. It was concluded, using this test, that 15-40% of phenols remained unextracted when the liquid/liquid extraction method with 80% methanol was applied. Solid phase extraction (C(18) cartridge) succeeded in retaining most of the phenols in the cartridge, but the recovery yield from the sorbent material was low. However, a new extraction method, based on the use of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as an extraction solvent, achieved a complete extraction of phenols from oils. The proposed method requires a lower amount of oil, solvents, energy, and labor than the traditional ones. Because of the low concentration of phenols in the DMF extract, the highly sensitive electrochemical detector (EC) technique was studied. All of the phenols detected by the traditional UV detectors were also detected by EC using a coulometric array system. A rapid and complete analytical methodology of phenols in olive oil has been proposed based on coupling DMF extraction and EC detection.","142.0"
"Absorption, metabolism and excretion of flavanones from single portions of orange fruit and juice and effects of anthropometric variables and contraceptive pill use on flavanone excretion","18710603.0","Oranges are rich sources of flavonoids that are bioactive and may protect against age-related diseases. The absorption of orange flavanones may be affected by factors such as processing and subject anthropometric variables, and the bioactivity of the absorbed phytochemicals depends on how they are metabolised during absorption. In a randomised cross-over study, twenty subjects consumed a single portion of orange fruit (150 g) or juice (300 g) that contained the flavanones narirutin and hesperidin, and an additional 109 subjects across a broad age range (18-80 years) consumed the juice. Flavanone metabolites were measured in regularly collected samples of plasma and urine. After consumption of fruit or juice, flavanone conjugates, but not the aglycones, were detected in plasma and urine. The flavanone conjugates were shown to include the 7- and 4'-O-monoglucuronides of naringenin, the 7- and 3'-O-monoglucuronides of hesperetin, two hesperetin diglucuronides and a hesperetin sulfo-glucuronide, but no aglycones or rutinosides. Analysis of the plasma pharmacokinetic and urinary excretion data on a dose-adjusted basis indicated no difference in absorption or excretion of either flavanone between the fruit and juice matrices. In the extended urinary excretion dataset the individual variation was very large (range 0-59 % urinary yield). There was a small but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the excretion of hesperetin (but not naringenin) with increasing age (P < 0.05), but the effects of sex, BMI and contraceptive pill use were shown not to be associated with the variation in flavanone excretion.","143.0"
"Method for determining the content of catechins in tea infusions by high-performance liquid chromatography","9618918.0","A high-performance liquid chromatography method employing diode array detection was developed to determine levels of the major catechins present in black, green, and Jasmine tea infusions. Reversed-phase separations were performed on a C18 column using three gradients: acetonitrile-acetate buffer, methanol-acetate buffer, and acetonitrile-acetate buffer with ascorbic acid. The identities of the tea catechins were established by comparing absorbance spectra and retention times to reference standards chromatographed under identical conditions. Epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate were found in all the tea infusions examined, ranging in concentration from 1-13 mg dl-1. These levels indicate that even moderate tea consumption can contribute a substantial quantity of flavanols to the diet. Although some differences between the three brewed teas were evident, all were comparably good sources of these catechins.","144.0"

The major carotenoids identified after HPLC analysis in saponified samples were lutein (37-53μg/kg), β-carotene (18-31μg/kg), violaxanthin (9-23μg/kg) and neoxanthin (10-22μg/kg). These carotenoids were all affected by storage and/or heating. The content of carotenoids was best preserved after storage for one day at 4°C. The total phenolic content in the fresh spinach was 2088mg GAE/kg FW. After LC-MS analysis three phenolic acids were identified and quantified. These being ortho-coumaric acid (28-60mg/kg FW), ferulic acid (10-35mg/kg) and para-coumaric acid (1-30mg/kg) depending on the sample type.

"Phenolic compounds and their changes in apples during maturation and cold storage","","Cider quality is influenced by numerous factors relating to the apples used during production. While extensive research has been done to explore the phenolic content, sensory quality, and storage stability of various apple products, the domain of fermented apple products, such as ciders, remains underrepresented. Red-fleshed apples (RFAs) have naturally high concentrations of phenolic compounds, which indicate their potential in the production of novel cider products. However, a knowledge gap remains regarding the application of RFAs in cider production and how their physicochemical and sensory properties are changed during processing. This review is the first to comprehensively investigate whether and to what extent apple categories (dessert, cider, and RFAs) differ regarding their physicochemical and sensory properties from harvest throughout cider processing. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of a holistic understanding of apple characteristics, encompassing both traditional and RFA varieties in the context of cider production. The findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders aiming to enhance product quality, providing a foundation for future studies on optimizing processing methods for a diverse and appealing range of ciders.","147.0"
"Quantification of free and protein-bound trans-resveratrol metabolites and identification of trans-resveratrol-C/O-conjugated diglucuronides - two novel resveratrol metabolites in human plasma","18435437.0","The polyphenol trans-resveratrol (t-RES) is present as t-RES-3-O-beta-D-glycoside, termed piceid, in several plant-derived foods. Although data on the metabolism and on in vivo effects of t-RES have been reported, quantitative data on the metabolites formed after dietary intake of t-RES or piceid are still lacking. In this study, 85.5 mg of piceid per 70 kg of body weight (bw) were administered to healthy volunteers in a bolus dose. t-RES metabolites formed in plasma and urine were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS, NMR, and HPLC-DAD analysis using chemically synthesized t-RES conjugate standards. In addition, the amount of t-RES metabolites bound noncovalently to plasma proteins was determined for the first time in humans. The metabolites identified and quantified were t-RES-3-sulfate, t-RES-3,4'-disulfate, t-RES-3,5-disulfate, t-RES-3-glucuronide and t-RES-4'-glucuronide, with t-RES-sulfates being the dominant conjugates in plasma and urine. Besides these metabolites, two novel t-RES-C/O-conjugated diglucuronides have been identified and quantified in plasma and urine. Moreover, it could be shown that up to 50% of the plasma t-RES-3-sulfate, t-RES-disulfates, and the novel t-RES-C/O-diglucuronides were bound to proteins.

"Relationship among antioxidant activity, vasodilation capacity, and phenolic content of red wines","10691619.0","The relationship among antioxidant activity, based on the electron-spin resonance determination of the reduction of Fremy's radical, vasodilation activity, and phenolic content was investigated in 16 red wines. The wines were selected to provide a range of origins, grape varieties, and vinification methods. Sensitive and selective HPLC methods were used for the analysis of the major phenolics in red wine: free and conjugated myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin; (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, caftaric acid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol, and trans-resveratrol glucoside. Total anthocyanins were measured using a colorimetric assay. The total phenolic content of the wines was determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay and also by the cumulative measurements obtained by HPLC. The 16 wines exhibited a wide range in the values of all parameters investigated. However, the total phenol contents, measured both by HPLC and colorimetrically, correlated very strongly with the antioxidant activity and vasodilation activity. In addition, the antioxidant activity was associated with gallic acid, total resveratrol, and total catechin. In contrast, only the total anthocyanins were correlated with vasodilation activity. The results demonstrate that the different phenolic profiles of wines can produce varying antioxidant and vasodilatant activities, which opens up the possibility that some red wines may provide enhanced health benefits for the consumer.","149.0"
"Plant foods and herbal sources of resveratrol","12010007.0","Stilbenes, in particular trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, are widely reported to be beneficial to health, having been shown to possess antioxidative, anticarcinogenic, and antitumor properties. Major dietary sources include grapes, wine, peanuts, and soy; however, they can also be introduced into the diet through Itadori tea, which has long been used in Japan and China as a traditional herbal remedy for heart disease and strokes. Analysis of grapes, peanuts, and Itadori tea shows that they contain mainly trans-resveratrol glucoside. In contrast, red wines are primarily a source of the aglycones cis- and trans-resveratrol. While peanuts and grapes contain low levels of the stilbenes, Itadori tea and red wine both supply relatively high concentrations of resveratrol. For people who do not consume alcohol, Itadori tea may be a suitable substitute for red wine. However, further study on the potential biological effects of other endogenous compounds in Itadori tea is required and there is also a need for more information on the absorption and in vivo biomedical actions of free and conjugated resveratrol.","150.0"

"Alkylperoxyl radical scavenging activity of red leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) phenolics","14705882.0","Although lettuce may provide relatively low levels of antioxidative phytochemicals which may contribute to human health, lettuce leaf extracts in fact contained compounds with high specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities. After determining the extraction conditions that minimized phenolic oxidation and produced the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values, the phenolic compounds from red leaf lettuce were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The primary phenolic compounds in the leaf tissue extracts were mono- and dicaffeoyltartaric acid (CTA and DCTA), mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acid (CQA and DCQA), quercetin 3-malonylglucoside (QMG), quercetin 3-glucoside (QG), cyanidin 3-malonylglucoside (CMG), and an unknown phenolic ester (UPE). Significant levels of DCQA were only found after wounding. Using the new fluorescein-based ORAC assay procedures, fractions from the HPLC analyses were assayed for peroxyl radical absorbance capacity. Using absorbance to estimate concentration, the decreasing order of contribution to the total ORAC value of an extract from wounded tissue was QMG > DCQA > CMG > DCTA > UPE > QG > CTA. The decreasing order of the specific peroxyl radical scavenging activities was CMG > QG > DCTA > DCQA > QMG > UPE > CQA > CTA. Since the concentrations of plant flavonoid and phenolic acid esters are sensitive to environmental factors, this information may be used to develop pre- and postharvest conditions which increase the dietary benefits of leaf lettuce.","155.0"

B, Fuji cl. Kiku8, Braeburn cl. Hillwell). The content of analysed phyto-compounds depended on the clone, on the part of fruit, and to a minor extent, on the storage. For EC(50) data, the cultivar represented the main source of variation and the interaction with the type of tissue, was significant. The AA of apples, measured by means of the DPPH test, was highly correlated to the flavan-3-ols content, which represents a good predictor of the apple antiradical power. The new Braeburn's clone, the Hillwell, had the worst AA related to a minor phyto-chemical content. Also, its phenolic content was dramatically reduced after cold storage (flesh: -50%; peels: -20%; p<0.05). Obtained results underlined the key role of the genotype on the content of the nutraceutical power of apples, which is important to improve their quality and consumption benefits, suggesting to the breeders to pay more attention to the potential healthy compounds in the development of new hybrids.","164.0"

The methanolic extracts of the pearled bean samples were screened for antioxidant potential using the beta-carotene-linoleate and the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. The pearled material, also referred to as milled samples, exhibited antioxidant activity that correlated with phenolic content and inhibited DPPH significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Phenolics and antioxidant activities were also examined in chromatographic fractions of methanolic extracts of manually obtained hulls that represented a model used previously to ascertain antimutagenic activity. Fractions extracted with ethyl acetate/acetone and acetone displayed antioxidant activity, which implies potent free radical scavenging activity with antimutagenic activity.","165.0"
"Characterisation of phenolic extracts from olive pulp and olive pomace by electrospray mass spectrometry","","Methanol extracts of olive pomace (two-phase olive oil extraction) and olive pulp were analysed by reverse phase HPLC and the eluted fractions were characterised by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. This technique allowed the identification of some common phenolic compounds, namely, verbascoside, rutin, caffeoyl-quinic acid, luteolin-4-glucoside and 11-methyl-oleoside. Hydroxytyrosol-1′-β-glucoside, luteolin-7-rutinoside and oleoside were also detected. Moreover, this technique enabled the identification, for the first time in Olea europaea tissues, of two oleoside derivatives, 6′-β-glucopyranosyl-oleoside and 6′-β-rhamnopyranosyl-oleoside, and of 10-hydroxy-oleuropein. Also, an oleuropein glucoside that had previously been identified in olive leaves was now detected in olive fruit, both in olive pulp and olive pomace. With the exception of oleoside and oleuropein, the majority of phenolic compounds were found to occur in equivalent amounts in olive pulp and olive pomace. Oleoside was the main phenolic compound in olive pulp (31.6 mg g−1) but was reduced to 3.6 mg g−1 in olive pomace, and oleuropein (2.7 mg g−1 in the pulp) almost disappeared (<0.1 mg g−1 in the pomace). Both these phenolic compounds were degraded during the olive oil extraction process.","166.0"
"Spectrophotometric and coulometric detection in the high-performance liquid chromatography of flavonoids and optimization of sample treatment for the determination of quercetin in orange juice","10905727.0","The capabilities of spectrophotometric and electrochemical detection techniques were investigated for the high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of flavonoids. Liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on eleven compounds belonging to three different classes of flavonoids: flavanone glycosides, flavone and flavonol aglycones. Separation of all compounds examined was carried out under reversed-phase conditions on a C18 narrow-bore column for UV detection, whereas for electrochemical detection, a C18 standard-bore column was used. UV analyses were carried out at 280 nm for flavanones and at 265 nm for flavones and flavonols, whereas controlled-potential coulometric measurements were performed using a porous graphite electrode. Analytical performances of the methods were compared in terms of linearity, limits of detection (LODs) and precision. Linearity over two orders of magnitude and LODs at low-ppm levels (0.06-1 mg/l) were demonstrated for all techniques considered. Instrumental precision in terms of relative standard deviation was found to be between 0 and 5% for the liquid chromatography (LC)-UV system and between 0.6 and 10% for the LC-electrochemical detection (ED) system. The methods developed were applied to the analysis of flavanones and flavonols in a real sample, such as an extract of orange juice. Even though quercetin glycoside is mostly present in orange juice as rutin, other different glycosides of this flavonol could be present; on this basis, the hydrolysis of all glycosides to aglycone allows one to obtain more accurate data on the flavonol concentration in orange juice. To avoid sample degradation and to increase extraction efficiency, quercetin hydrolysis was optimized using a central composite design to investigate the effects of acid concentration and hydrolysis time on extraction recovery.","167.0"
"Influence of organic versus conventional agricultural practice on the antioxidant microconstituent content of tomatoes and derived purees  consequences on antioxidant plasma status in humans","15479014.0","The present study aims first to compare the antioxidant microconstituent contents between organically and conventionally grown tomatoes and, second, to evaluate whether the consumption of purees made of these tomatoes can differently affect the plasma levels of antioxidant microconstituents in humans. When results were expressed as fresh matter, organic tomatoes had higher vitamin C, carotenoids, and polyphenol contents (except for chlorogenic acid) than conventional tomatoes. When results were expressed as dry matter, no significant difference was found for lycopene and naringenin. In tomato purees, no difference in carotenoid content was found between the two modes of culture, whereas the concentrations of vitamin C and polyphenols remained higher in purees made out of organic tomatoes. For the nutritional intervention, no significant difference (after 3 weeks of consumption of 96 g/day of tomato puree) was found between the two purees with regard to their ability to affect the plasma levels of the two major antioxidants, vitamin C and lycopene.","168.0"
"Flavonoids detection by HPLC-DAD-MS-MS in lemon juices from Sicilian cultivars","12769519.0","High-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) coupled with electronspray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to detect the flavonoid profile in lemon juices obtained from the main Sicilian cultivars (Femminello comune, Monachello, and Interdonato). Significant amounts of an unusual constituent were found in the lemon juice of the above-mentioned cultivars together with eriocitrin, hesperidin, and diosmin. Following purification by preparative HPLC, the structure was assigned as 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosyldiosmetin by means of DAD-UV, ESI-MS-MS, and (1)H NMR analysis. Three other minor components were also detected. One of these presented a flavone nature, and spectral data and literature references both suggested a 6,8-di-C-glucopyranosylapigenin structure. The different contents of eriocitrin, hesperidin, diosmin, and above minor components in the cultivars allow juices to be readily differentiated.","169.0"
"Anthocyanin excretion by humans increases linearly with increasing strawberry dose","18424598.0","A clinical study was conducted to investigate the dose response and metabolism of strawberry anthocyanins. In a crossover study design, 12 healthy adults consumed each of 3 strawberry treatments. The treatments were 100 g, 200 g, and 400 g of pureed strawberries, delivering 15 micromol, 30 micromol, and 60 micromol anthocyanin, respectively. Urine samples were collected for 24 h after each dose and samples were analyzed by HPLC with diode array detection and ion trap MS. Pelargonidin 3-glucoside was the major anthocyanin form in the treatments, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside and 3 metabolites of pelargonidin 3-glucoside (detected as monoglucuronides) were excreted in urine after ingestion. One predominant monoglucuronide form was detected in urine in masses 10-fold higher than the other 2 monoglucuronide forms. Increasing dose resulted in increasing appearance of anthocyanins in urine, and the mass of each pelargonidin monoglucuronide increased in urine with increasing dose. These results suggest that pelargonidin 3-glucoside absorption and metabolism are not saturated at masses < or = 60 micromol, thus showing that more strawberry anthocyanin can be absorbed with increasing dose.","170.0"
"Identification of the flavonoid fraction in saffron spice by LC/DAD/MS/MS: Comparative study of samples from different geographical origins","","The flavonoid fraction in saffron spice has been analysed, for the first time, by LC-DAD-MS/MS ESI and five kaempferol derivatives have been found. Compounds such as kaempferol-3-sophoroside, kaempferol-3-sophoroside-7-glucoside and kaempferol-3,7,4'-triglucoside were tentatively identified, whereas other compounds, such as kaempferol tetrahexoside and kaempferol-3-dihexoside were detected. Saffron samples from different geographical origins were clearly separated by their kaempferol 3-sophoroside contents that were able to explain 100% of the variance when a discriminant test was carried out.","171.0"
"The aromatic and polyphenolic composition of lemon verbena tea","","The chemical composition of the largely used tea from lemon verbena, Aloysia triphylla, was investigated. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the main aromatic and polyphenolic constituents of tea made by infusion from leaves were examined. The results showed that the relative proportions of the active constituents differ from those of the original leaves. The tea contained a large amount of polyphenolic compounds (mean value 675 mg/l; extraction yield 65%) including verbascoside (400 mg/l) and luteolin 7-diglucuronide (100 mg/l). It contained also 42 mg/l of essential oil (extraction yield 51%) with much more citral (77% of the essential oil) than the original leaves (41%).","172.0"
"Changes of flavonoids, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity in minimally processed citrus segments and juices during storage","","Citrus fruits of different species and cultivars, (“Red blush” grapefruit, “Palazzelli” mandarin-type fruit, “Minneola” tangelo and “Salustiana” and “Shamouti” orange) were minimally processed as segments or juices and cold-stored for up to 12 or 15 days, respectively. The flavanone glycosides, ascorbic acid (AA) content and antioxidant capacity were determined during storage. Minimal processing had almost no effect on the main chemical constituents, but ascorbic acid decreased significantly in “Minneola” and “Salustiana” segments, with values ranging from 1.63 to 5.10 mg per gram of dry matter, although only in the last samples taken. One of the three juices (Salustiana) also showed a decrease in AA content. The segments and juices showed different behaviour during storage with regard to the flavonoid content, which ranged from 0.77 mg to 8.32 mg/g dry matter in Palazzelli mandarin and Red blush grapefruit, respectively. A significant increase in total flavonoids (mainly hesperidin) was found in the segments, while the juices showed a diminution in flavonoid content . Antioxidant capacity increased significantly in “Red blush” grapefruit juices and “Salustiana” orange segments, decreased in “Salustiana” juices and “Minneola” tangelo segments and remained constant in the other samples. The antioxidant capacity, moreover, was clearly correlated (r=0.968 and r=0.889 in segments and juices, respectively) with the ascorbic acid content rather than with the presence of flavanone glycosides.","173.0"
"Effect of drying conditions and storage period on polyphenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and ascorbic acid of prunes","15264914.0","In this study the main chemical parameters, ascorbic acid and polyphenol content, and antioxidant activity of two varieties of prunes, dried by high-temperature (85 + 70 degrees C) and low-temperature (60 degrees C) procedures, were monitored during storage. Ascorbic acid content was higher in the prunes dried at 60 degrees C but significantly decreased in both varieties during storage. The different classes of polyphenols analyzed (cinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols) showed different stabilities during storage. Neochlorogenic acid decreased only in the President variety, whereas chlorogenic acid increased in both varieties; anthocyanins, present only in the President prunes, disappeared in the first months of storage, and the flavonol content fell significantly in both cultivars during the year of the study. Drying temperature significantly affected the polyphenol content, with different effects according to the class of polyphenols. Antioxidant activity showed a significant increase at the end of the storage period and in the President variety was higher in the sample dried at the higher temperature.","174.0"
"Sensitive determination of phenolic acids in extra-virgin olive oil by capillary zone electrophoresis","15506801.0","A sensitive, rapid, efficient, and reliable method for the separation and determination of phenolic acids by capillary zone electrophoresis has been carried out. A detailed method optimization was carried out to separate 14 different compounds by studying parameters such as pH, type and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and injection time. The separation was performed within 16 min, using a 25 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.6) at 25 kV with 8 s of hydrodynamic injection. With this method and using a liquid-liquid extraction system, with recovery values around 95%, it has been possible to detect small quantities of phenolic acids in olive oil samples.

"Co-electroosmotic capillary electrophoresis determination of phenolic acids in commercial olive oil","16013818.0","Fourteen phenolic acids have been selectively determined in olive-oil samples using the co-electrosmotic capillary electrophoresis mode with UV detection after the LLE extraction system. A polycationic surfactant (hexadimetrine bromide, HDB), which dynamically coats the inner surface of the capillary and causes a fast anodic electroosmotic flow, was added to the electrolyte. The main factors affecting co-electroosmotic flow (EOF) such as type of modifier, concentration, and influence of organic solvents have been studied. Other parameters such as pH, type, and concentration of buffer, applied voltage, and injection time were also optimised using hydrodynamic injection for 8 s and UV detection at 210 nm. The composition optimum of the running buffer used was a 20% 2-propanol, 0.001% HDB, and 50 mM sodium borate at a pH value of 9.6.

"Urinary excretion of olive oil phenols and their metabolites in humans","11735087.0","We have recently demonstrated, in humans, the bioavailability of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol; HT), one of the major antioxidant components of virgin olive oil. In particular, we reported that this compound is present in lipoproteins involved in atherosclerotic processes and is excreted in the urine mainly as glucuronide-conjugate. The aim of the present study was to elucidate, in humans, the metabolic fate of HT after ingestion of virgin olive oil. After administration of virgin olive oil, 24-hour urine collections of healthy volunteers were prepared for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses in order to identify and quantify HT and its metabolites homovanillic alcohol (HVA1c) and homovanillic acid (HVA). The results indicate that this compound undergoes the action of catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), enzymes involved in the catecholamine catabolism, resulting in an enhanced excretion of HVA1c. We also found a significant increase of HVA, indicating an oxidation of the ethanolic residue of HT and/or of HVA1c in humans. The excretion of both metabolites significantly correlated with the dose of administered HT.","179.0"
"Effects of hyper-oxygenation and storage of Macabeo and Airén white wines on their phenolic and volatile composition","","The effects of hyper-oxygenation and storage period of Macabeo and AirÃ©n white wines on color characteristics, phenolic, and volatile composition have been evaluated. Hyper-oxygenation treatment provoked a significant decrease in virtually all individual phenolic compounds in must, young wine, and one-year-aged wines, above all hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonols, and the new GRP derivatives compounds (derived from 2-S-glutathionyl-caftaric acid or grape reaction product). Despite this fact, the contribution of the yellow color component (b*) of white wines derived from hyper-oxygenated musts was significantly higher in comparison with untreated ones, even after 1Â year of bottle storage. On the other hand, the concentration of major volatile compounds and some alcohols (namely, C6 alcohols, terpenes, and lactones) was higher in wines derived from hyper-oxygenated musts, but the hyper-oxygenation effect on volatile profile deeply depended on the grape variety. After 1Â year of bottle storage, the significant differences were maintained and the content of some long-chain esters increased as a consequence of oxygen addition.","180.0"

"Repeated oral administration of high doses of the pomegranate ellagitannin punicalagin to rats for 37 days is not toxic","12744688.0","The water-soluble ellagitanin punicalagin has been reported to be toxic to cattle. Taking into account that this antioxidant polyphenol is very abundant in pomegranate juice (> or =2 g/L), the present study evaluated the possible toxic effect of punicalagin in Sprague-Dawley rats upon repeated oral administration of a 6% punicalagin-containing diet for 37 days. Punicalagin and related metabolites were identified by HPLC-DAD-MS-MS in plasma, liver, and kidney. Five punicalagin-related metabolites were detected in liver and kidney, that is, two ellagic acid derivatives, gallagic acid, 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one glucuronide, and 3,8,10-trihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one. Feedstuff intake, food utility index, and growth rate were lower in treated rats during the first 15 days without significant adverse effects, which could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet together with a decrease in its palatability (lower food intake). No significant differences were found in treated rats in any blood parameter analyzed (including the antioxidant enzymes gluthatione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) with the exception of urea and triglycerides, which remained at low values throughout the experiment. Although the reason for the decrease is unclear, it could be due to the lower nutritional value of the punicalagin-enriched diet with respect to the standard rat food. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney corroborated the absence of toxicity. In principle, the results reported here, together with the large safety margin considered, indicate the lack of toxic effect of punicalagin in rats during the 37 day period investigated. However, taking into account the high punicalagin content of pomegranate-derived foodstuffs, safety evaluation should be also carried out in humans with a lower dose and during a longer period of intake.","182.0"

"Metabolism of antioxidant and chemopreventive ellagitannins from strawberries, raspberries, walnuts, and oak-aged wine in humans: Identification of biomarkers and individual variability","15656654.0","Ellagitannins (ETs) are dietary polyphenols, containing ellagic acid (EA) subunits, with antioxidant and cancer chemopreventive activities that might contribute to health benefits in humans. However, little is known about their metabolic fate. We investigate here the metabolism of different dietary ETs and EA derivatives in humans. Forty healthy volunteers were distributed in four groups. Each group consumed, in a single dose, a different ET-containing foodstuff, i.e., strawberries (250 g), red raspberries (225 g), walnuts (35 g), and oak-aged red wine (300 mL). After the intake, five urine fractions (F) were collected at 8 (F1), 16 (F2), 32 (F3), 40 (F4), and 56 (F5) h. Neither ETs nor EA were detected in urine after LC-MS/MS analysis. However, the microbial metabolite 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one (urolithin B) conjugated with glucuronic acid was detected along the fractions F3-F5 in all of the subjects, independently of the consumed foodstuff. The mean percentage of metabolite excretion ranged from 2.8 (strawberries) to 16.6% (walnuts) regarding the ingested ETs. Considerable interindividual differences were noted, identifying ""high and low metabolite excreters"" in each group, which supported the involvement of the colonic microflora in ET metabolism. These results indicate that urolithin B (a previously described antiangiogenic and hyaluronidase inhibitor compound) is a biomarker of human exposure to dietary ETs and may be useful in intervention studies with ET-containing products. The antioxidant and anticarcinogenic effects of dietary ETs and EA should be considered in the gastrointestinal tract whereas the study of potential systemic activities should be focused on the bioavailable urolithin B derivatives.","184.0"
"Analytical comparison of monovarietal virgin olive oils obtained by both a continuous industrial plant and a low-scale mill","","The olive oil from the Royal cultivar has not been studied in depth, especially its relationship between analytical and sensory parameters. Currently, it is a minority cultivar, but due to its excellent organoleptic properties, it is constantly growing. The research objective is to obtain excellent-quality olive oil from the Royal cultivar at an industrial extraction plant and characterize the oil sensory and analytically. For this purpose, three important factors were set: very early olives; very low-time olive paste malaxation; and environmental temperature. The analytical parameters studied were volatile and phenolic compounds, fatty acids, photosynthetic pigments, and other quality parameters. Fourteen phenolic compounds were identified and found in significantly higher concentrations in Royal olive oil, including the oleacein compound. Moreover, volatile compounds from the LOX pathway, such as hexenal, (<i>E</i>)-2-hexenal, and (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexen-1-ol, had significantly higher concentrations, which were related to organoleptic characteristics: very fruity, not very spicy, and very low bitterness.

"Antioxidative potential of cashew phenolics in food and biological model systems as affected by roasting","","The effect of different roasting conditions on antioxidant capacity of phenolics of cashew nuts and their testa was evaluated using several food and biological model systems. Total phenolic content (TPC) of cashew extracts was determined and accelerated oxidative stability of stripped corn oil in the presence of cashew extracts evaluated. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the extracts was assessed in a β-carotene-linoleate and a cooked comminuted pork model system. Inhibition of oxidation of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and stand breaking of supercoiled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was also investigated. The TPC ranged from 5 to 791mg gallic acid equivalents/g crude extract. In general, whole cashew nuts and testa extracts demonstrated stronger antioxidant activity than that of the cashew kernel. The inhibition percentage of LDL cholesterol oxidation, as evaluated by conjugated dines formation, of cashew kernels was higher than that of testa and was 69% at the end of 24h incubation. Extracts of roasted cashew nut showed considerable antioxidative efficiency in model systems employed in this study, however, the effect was not significantly (P⩽0.05) different from that of their raw counterparts, except for the accelerated oxidative stability assay. The results suggest that whole cashew nut and testa extracts could be used as a potential source of natural antioxidants in certain food applications and for disease risk reduction.","190.0"

Fecal, urine, and/or fasting blood samples were collected before supplementation (day -5), after 5 days of SPI (day 0), and after 2, 4 and 10 days of GP-SPI. Most multi-omic changes observed after 2 and/or 4 days of GP-SPI intake were temporary, returning to pre-supplementation profiles by day 10. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing provided insights that could not be captured with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Notably, 10 days of GP-SPI decreased fasting blood glucose and increased serum hyocholic acid (HCA), a glucoregulatory bile acid, which negatively correlated with one gut bacterial guild. In conclusion, GP-induced suppression of a bacterial guild may lead to higher HCA and lower fasting blood glucose.","193.0"
"Screening of antioxidant activity and antioxidant compounds of some edible plants of Thailand","","A large number of plants, which have been used as food and herbs in Thailand, were investigated for their antioxidant activity by using a beta-carotene bleaching method. The contents of plant chemicals, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, tannin, and total phenolics, were also determined. The results showed that the highest antioxidant activity was found in the plant Gymnema inodorum, followed by Piper sarmentosum and Mentha arvensis, respectively. G. inodorum also contained the highest amount of vitamin E, and M. arvensis contained the highest amount of total xanthophylls. Correlations between the chemical content of each plant and the antioxidant index were observed. The results suggest that chemicals such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds are the contributors to the antioxidant activity in the plants.","194.0"
"Total anthocyanins and total phenolics of fresh and processed cherries and their antioxidant properties","","The taste, aroma, and sensory characteristics of cherries are key factors influencing consumer acceptance. In this study, the sensory evaluation, biochemical characteristics, and their relationships with consumer satisfaction of several representative cherry cultivars were analyzed during cold storage to establish systematic quality evaluation parameters. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant differences in physiological quality and metabolic profiles among the tested cultivars. Specifically, 'Benitemari' demonstrated more contents of soluble solids and titratable acid, while 'Tieton' and 'Skeena' showed higher concentrations of volatile organic compounds and polyphenolics. Furthermore, hexanal and (E)-2-hexenal were identified as the dominant VOCs, while cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside was confirmed as a major phenolic component across the cultivars. Finally, the comprehensive score of the principal component model was significantly positively correlated with the scores of firmness, chewiness, sweetness, sourness, and taste and bitterness in the sensory evaluation. The results were expected to provide valuable guidance for standardizing the sweet cherry supply chain and cultivating high-quality sweet cherry cultivars.","195.0"

"effect of dose size on bioavailability of acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins from red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. Var. capitata)","17542615.0","Recent studies indicate that anthocyanin intake conveys a variety of health benefits, which depend on absorption and metabolic mechanisms that deliver anthocyanins and their bioactive metabolites to responsive tissues. The anthocyanin bioavailability of red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) was evaluated as reflected by urinary excretion of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites. Twelve volunteers consumed 100, 200, and 300 g of steamed red cabbage (containing 1.38 micromol of anthocyanins/g of cabbage) in a crossover design. Anthocyanin concentration in cabbage extract and urine was measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Six nonacylated and 30 acylated anthocyanins were detected in red cabbage, and 3 nonacylated anthocyanins, 8 acylated anthocyanins, and 4 metabolites were present in urine. Mean 24 h excretion of intact anthocyanins increased linearly from 45 (100 g dose) to 65 nmol (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 52 (100 g dose) to 79 nmol (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Urinary recovery of intact anthocyanins (percent of anthocyanin intake) decreased linearly from 0.041% (100 g dose) to 0.020% (300 g dose) for acylated anthocyanins and from 0.18% (100 g dose) to 0.09% (300 g dose) for nonacylated anthocyanins. Anthocyanin metabolites consisted of glucuronidated and methylated anthocyanins. The results show that red cabbage anthocyanins were excreted in both intact and metabolized forms and that recovery of nonacylated anthocyanins in urine was >4-fold that of acylated anthocyanins.","197.0"
"Bioavailability of anthocyanins from purple carrot juice: effects of acylation and plant matrix","19166298.0","Absorption of cyanidin-based anthocyanins is not fully understood with respect to dose or anthocyanin structure. In feeding studies using whole foods, nonacylated anthocyanins are more bioavailable than their acylated counterparts, but the extent to which plant matrix determines relative bioavailability of anthocyanins is unknown. Using juice of purple carrots to circumvent matrix effects, a feeding trial was conducted to determine relative bioavailability of acylated and nonacylated anthocyanins and to assess dose-response effects. Appearance of anthocyanins in plasma was measured in 10 healthy adults for 8 h following consumption of purple carrot juice. Each subject consumed 50, 150, and 250 mL of juice containing 76 micromol (65 mg), 228 micromol (194 mg), and 380 micromol (323 mg) of total anthocyanins, respectively. Acylated anthocyanins comprised 76% of total anthocyanins in the juice, yet their bioavailability was found to be significantly less than that of nonacylated anthocyanins. Peak plasma concentrations of nonacylated anthocyanins were 4-fold higher than that for acylated anthocyanins. Absorption efficiency declined across the doses administered. Because the treatments were consumed as juice, it could be discerned that the difference in bioavailability of acylated versus nonacylated anthocyanins was not primarily caused by interactions with the plant matrix.","198.0"
"Three-year comparison of the content of antioxidant microconstituents and several quality characteristics in organic and conventionally managed tomatoes and bell peppers","17032035.0","Understanding how the environment and production and cultivation practices influence the composition and quality of food crops is fundamental to the production of high-quality nutritious foods. In this 3-year study, total phenolics, percent soluble solids, ascorbic acid, and the flavonoid aglycones quercetin, kaempferol, and luteolin were measured in two varieties of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L. cv. Ropreco and Burbank) and two varieties of bell peppers (Capsicum annuum L. cv. California Wonder and Excalibur) grown by certified organic and conventional practices in a model system. Significantly higher levels of percent soluble solids (17%), quercetin (30%), kaempferol (17%), and ascorbic acid (26%) were found in Burbank tomatoes (fresh weight basis; FWB), whereas only levels of percent soluble solids (10%) and kaempferol (20%) were significantly higher in organic Ropreco tomatoes (FWB). Year-to-year variability was significant, and high values from 2003 influenced the 3-year average value of quercetin reported for organic Burbank tomatoes. Burbank tomatoes generally had higher levels of quercetin, kaempferol, total phenolics, and ascorbic acid as compared to Ropreco tomatoes. Bell peppers were influenced less by environment and did not display cropping system differences.","199.0"
"Degradation of green tea catechins in tea drinks","","Green tea cateachins (GTC). namely (-) epicatechin (EC), (-) epicatechin gallate (ECG), (-) epigallocatechin (EGC), and (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), have been studied extensively for their wide-ranging biological activities. The goal of the present study was to examine the stability of GTC as a mixture under various processing conditions. The stability study demonstrated that GTC was stable in water at room temperature. When it was brewed at 98 degrees C for 7 h, longjing GTC degraded by 20%. When longjing GTC and pure EGCG were autoclaved at 120 degrees C for 20 min, the epimerization of EGCG to (-) gallocatechin gallate (GCG) was observed. The relatively high amount of GCG found in some tea drinks was most likely the epimerization product of EGCG during autoclaving. If other ingredients were absent, the GTC in aqueous solutions was pH-sensitive: the lower the pH, the more stable the GTC during storage. When it was added into commercially available soft drinks or sucrose solutions containing citric acid and ascorbic acid, longjing GTC exhibited varying stability irrespective of low pH value. This suggested that other ingredients used in production of tea drinks might interact with GTC and affect its stability. When canned and bottled tea drinks are produced, stored, and transported, the degradation of GTC must be taken into consideration.","200.0"
"Separation and determination of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds in cranberry juice by high-performance liquid chromatography","11355837.0","A HPLC method was developed for the separation and determination of flavonoid and phenolic antioxidants in cranberry juices. Free flavonoid and phenolic compounds were fractionated into neutral and acidic groups by means of a solid-phase extraction method, followed by subsequent HPLC separations. Combined flavonoids and phenolics were hydrolyzed by acid before HPLC analysis. This developed method provides a fast and high resolution of individual flavonoid and phenolic compounds. In cranberry fruit, flavonoids and phenolic acids exist predominantly in combined forms, such as glycosides and esters. A total of 400 mg of total flavonoids and phenolic compounds/l of sample was found in a freshly squeezed cranberry juice, which was distributed as about 44% of phenolic acids and 56% of flavonoids. Benzoic acid was the major phenolic compound. Major flavonoids in the freshly squeezed cranberry juice were quercetin and myricetin.","201.0"
"Alkylresorcinols as markers of whole grain wheat and rye in cereal products","15612824.0","The alkylresorcinol (AR) content of Swedish wheat grain samples, as well as of cereal ingredients and cereal foods containing wheat and rye, was determined. The average total AR content in Swedish wheat was 412 microg/g (ranging between 227 and 639 microg/g), which is lower than that in Swedish rye analyzed in a previous study. The relative composition of AR homologues was consistent for wheat samples and differed markedly from that of rye. Notably, the ratio of the homologues C17:0/C21:0 was approximately 0.1 in wheat and approximately 1.0 in rye, indicating that it can be used to distinguish between those two cereals. The AR content in cereal foods commonly consumed in Sweden varied widely, from nondetectable levels in white wheat flour and products not containing the outer parts of wheat and/or rye to >900 microg/g in some whole grain rye products. AR content in cereal foods was calculated from their recipes using average AR values for the cereal ingredients determined in this study. As there was a good correlation between calculated and analyzed AR levels in cereal foods (R2 = 0.91), it is possible to estimate the proportion of whole grain wheat and/or rye in a given cereal product on the basis of AR content and C17:0/C21:0 ratio. ARs appear to be good markers of whole grain wheat and rye in foods, and their analysis may be an objective way to identify foods rich in whole grain wheat and/or rye or brans thereof.","202.0"
"Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the flavonoid scutellarin in humans after a single oral administration","16714374.0","Scutellarin is widely used in treating various cardiovascular diseases. Few data are available regarding its metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. The objectives of this study were to develop methods to identify major metabolites of scutellarin in human urine and plasma and to determine simultaneously the parent drug and its major metabolites in human plasma for pharmacokinetic studies. Four metabolites were detected in urine samples by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS), but only one of them was found in plasma. Its structure was confirmed as scutellarein 6-O-beta-D-glucuronide by MS, NMR, and UV absorbance spectra. The plasma concentrations of scutellarin and the major metabolite were simultaneously determined using liquid chromatography-tandem MS. After a single p.o. administration of 60 mg of scutellarin to 20 healthy subjects, the plasma concentrations of scutellarin were very low, and its plasma concentration-time curve was also anomalous. Plasma concentration of the major metabolite was comparatively high, and the peak plasma concentration was 87.0 +/- 29.1 ng/ml. The Tmax was late (7.85 +/- 1.62 h), and part of individual pharmacokinetic profiles showed double peaks, which indicated scutellarin could be absorbed into the intestine after hydrolysis to its aglycone by bacterial enzymes. This was followed by reconjugation in the intestinal cell and/or liver with glucuronic acid catalyzed by the phase II enzyme, which showed regioselectivity and species difference. The regioselectivity of glucuronoconjugation for scutellarin may be of importance for pharmacological activity. Plasma concentration of isoscutellarin can be used as a biomarker of scutellarin intake.","203.0"
"Quantitative determination of acetyl glucoside isoflavones and their metabolites in human urine using combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry","","To investigate whether the bioavailability of isoflavones could be an alternative to fermented soy foods, the conjugated forms of soy nutritional supplement (containing 98% acetyl glucoside isoflavones) were consumed by eight human volunteers (three were Asian people and five were British). Their daily urine samples were collected before and after a 5-week consumption of supplementation period. Conjugated isoflavones of genistein, daidzein and glycitein were hydrolyzed by enzyme, extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether and analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Daidzein, genistein, glycitein, dihydrogenistein, dihydrodaidzein and O-desmethylangolensin were identified and quantified simultaneously with high recoveries. The levels of free isoflavones and total isoflavones were compared, and isoflavone glucuronides were identified much higher than the corresponding sulfates or aglycone isoflavones. This method provided the measurement of isoflavones with high sensitivity and specificity and simplified the sample pre-treatment procedure. The limitation of detections of dihydrodaidzein, 3'-hydroxydaidzein, glycitein, daidzein, genistein, dihydrogenistein and O-desmethylangolensin were 37, 23.5, 12.2, 15.4, 14.8, 2.20 and 0.31 pmol, respectively.

"Nutritional quality of black bean (Phaseolus) seeds","","Common beans (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.) are a cornerstone of global nutrition, offering a sustainable source of protein, micronutrients, and bioactive compounds. This review synthesizes current research on critical consumer traits-seed coat darkening, cooking time, protein, and mineral content-highlighting their genetic, biochemical, and environmental determinants. Seed coat darkening, driven by proanthocyanidin oxidation and regulated by genes like <i>J</i>, <i>sd</i>, and <i>Psd</i>, significantly impacts marketability, while cooking time variations (19-271 min across genotypes) influence regional preferences and nutritional outcomes. Biofortification and low-phytic acid (lpa) breeding strategies enhance mineral bioavailability, addressing deficiencies in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Regional disparities in consumer preferences, such as the demand for fast-cooking yellow beans in East Africa, underscore the need for tailored breeding programs. Climate change poses challenges to yield and nutrient retention, necessitating climate-resilient varieties. This review proposes integrating genomics, marker-assisted selection, and postharvest innovations, for developing beans that align with consumer needs, cultural practices, and sustainability goals.

"Flavonoid content of several vegetables and their antioxidant activity","","The disposal of broccoli by-products, such as broccoli leaves and stems, can potentially have harmful impacts on the environment. However, these by-products may contain substantial amounts of phytochemical compounds with potential health benefits. In this study, the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activities of different parts of broccoli leaves, such as leaf blades and petioles, were analyzed to identify their potential use as functional food materials. Ten glucosinolates, 1 nitrile, 1 isothiocyanate, 14 hydroxycinnamic acids, 3 benzoic acids, 5 flavonoids, and 1 lignan were detected in the broccoli leaf blades, whereas 10 glucosinolates, 1 nitrile, 1 isothiocyanate, 11 hydroxycinnamic acids, 3 benzoic acids, 0 flavonoid, and 1 lignan were detected in the petioles. Antioxidant activity was consistently high in the leaf blades, indicating greater accumulation of bioactive compounds in the blades. Furthermore, broccoli leaf blades were subjected to different cooking methods (boiling, steaming, and sous-vide) to assess changes in antioxidant activities, and sulforaphane content. Significant differences were observed depending on the cooking method, with steaming and sous-vide methods demonstrating greater antioxidant activity than that of boiling. Although both boiling and steaming resulted in a reduction in sulforaphane content compared with that of the raw samples, the sous-vide method led to an increase in sulforaphane content. In conclusion, broccoli leaf blades have superior phytochemical composition and antioxidant activities, and when broccoli leaf blades are cooked sous-vide, the retention of bioactive compounds is the highest, suggesting that health functional foods can be developed through food upcycling.","210.0"
"Antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of common vegetables","","Epidemiological studies have shown that consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases. Increased consumption of fruits and vegetables containing high levels of phytochemicals has been recommended to prevent chronic diseases related to oxidative stress in the human body. In this study, 10 common vegetables were selected on the basis of consumption per capita data in the United States. A more complete profile of phenolic distributions, including both free and bound phenolics in these vegetables, is reported here using new and modified methods. Broccoli possessed the highest total phenolic content, followed by spinach, yellow onion, red pepper, carrot, cabbage, potato, lettuce, celery, and cucumber. Red pepper had the highest total antioxidant activity, followed by broccoli, carrot, spinach, cabbage, yellow onion, celery, potato, lettuce, and cucumber. The phenolics antioxidant index (PAI) was proposed to evaluate the quality/quantity of phenolic contents in these vegetables and was calculated from the corrected total antioxidant activities by eliminating vitamin C contributions. Antiproliferative activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human liver cancer cells. Spinach showed the highest inhibitory effect, followed by cabbage, red pepper, onion, and broccoli. On the basis of these results, the bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a simple reference for consumers to choose vegetables in accordance with their beneficial activities. The BI could be a new alternative biomarker for future epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.","211.0"
"Effect of cooking on the antioxidant properties of coloured peppers","","Pepper (Capsicum annum L.) has long been recognized as an excellent source of antioxidants, being rich in ascorbic acid and other phytochemicals. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of different cooking methods on the antioxidant properties of coloured peppers. Six varieties of peppers were subjected to different cooking methods, such as microwave heating, stir-frying and boiling in water, for 5min individually. The cooked and raw peppers were analyzed for radical-scavenging activity (RSA) and total polyphenol content (TP) using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl-high-pressure liquid chromatography (DPPH)-HPLC and Folin-Ciocalteu methods, respectively. The samples were also evaluated for ascorbic acid content (AsA) by HPLC. Total carotenoid content was determined spectrophotometrically. Results suggest that there is no significant (P >0.05) difference in RSA, TP, AsA and total carotenoid contents between the cooked and raw peppers when processed for 5min. However, the cooked peppers show marked differences (P <0.05) in the RSA, TP and AsA when cooked for 5min in boiling water with further reduction observed after boiling for 30min. This may be due to the leaching of antioxidant compounds from the pepper into the cooking water during the prolonged exposure to water and heat. Therefore, it is vital to use less water and cooking time and also to consume the water used for boiling so as to obtain the optimum benefits of bioactive compounds present in peppers. It is concluded that microwave heating and stir-frying without using water are more suitable cooking methods for pepper, to ensure the maximum retention of antioxidant molecules.","212.0"

Currently, limited data are available regarding the levels of these bioactive compounds in peanuts with variations in reported levels. The purpose of this study was to compare four methods of extraction [stirring, sonication, Soxtec, and microwave-assisted sonication (MAS)] for runner peanuts. Quantification of the selected compounds was conducted by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The results showed that the MAS and Soxtec methods extracted significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals. Also, the defatted peanuts gave significantly higher amounts of the phytochemicals compared to the nondefatted peanuts. The high levels of the isoflavones may be attributed to heat-induced conversion of conjugate glycosides to aglycons. The MAS and Soxtec methods may be used for total isoflavone content quantitation, while sonication or stirring may be the method of choice for quantitation of isoflavone composition (aglycons and glycoside conjugates) in peanuts.","214.0"
"Superoxide radical scavenging activity of the major polyphenols in fresh plums","14690398.0","The effect of polyphenols among different varieties of plums on superoxide radical scavenging activity (SRSA) was studied by an enzymatic method and their IC(50) values were determined. We found that the SRSA levels of the polyphenols were closely related to their chemical structures; cyanidin showed the lowest IC(50) among the polyphenols examined, and aglycones are more effective than their glycosides. BY 69-339 cultivar exhibited the lowest IC(50) among the eleven plum cultivars, which means the highest antioxidant activity in scavenging superoxide radicals, followed by French Damson, Cacaks Best, Beltsville Elite B70197, Empress, Castleton, Stanley, NY 6, NY 101, Mirabellier, and NY 9. IC(50) values showed a higher correlation with total flavonoids (r (2) = 0.8699) than total phenolics (r (2) = 0.8355), which indicated that flavonoids might contribute to the total SRSA more directly than other polyphenols. Anthocyanins in plums appeared to be the major contributors to the total SRSA, except for two yellow cultivars having no anthocyanins. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant phenolic acid, and it also exhibited SRSA significantly in the range of 1.0 to 94.9%. Quercetins were the major flavonols in plums.

There was a good linear relationship between the amount of total phenolics and total antioxidant capacity (r2 = 0.9887). The amount of total flavonoids and total antioxidant capacity also showed a good correlation (r2 = 0.9653). Although the summation of individual antioxidant capacity was lower than the total antioxidant capacity of plum samples, there was a positive correlation (r2 = 0.9299) of total antioxidant capacity of plum samples with the sum of the VCEACs calculated from individual phenolics. Chlorogenic acids and glycosides of cyanidin, peonidin, and quercetin were major phenolics among eleven plum cultivars. The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acids and anthocyanins showed higher correlation (r2) of 0.7751 and 0.6616 to total VCEAC, respectively, than that of quercetin glycosides (r2 = 0.0279).

"Consideration on equivalent chemicals in total phenolic assay of chlorogenic acid-rich plums","","The spectrophotometric characteristics of chemicals used as equivalents in Folin-Ciocalteu method were evaluated. Gallic acid and (+)-catechin showed the highest response at the range of 20-100 mg/L, followed by tannic acid, and then chlorogenic acid which exhibited relatively very low absorbance. Chlorogenic acid and neochlorogenic acid showed the lower absorbance than gallic acid by 0.6 times, and it might result in underestimation of the real total phenolic content of chlorogenic acid-rich samples. Chlorogenic acid and neochlorogenic acid exhibited nearly the same spectra in a broad absorbance range, and chlorogenic acid could be appropriate for an equivalent chemical instead of neochlorogenic acid, which has been proved as a major phenolic compound in plums. The average total phenolics in 13 plum cultivars expressed by chlorogenic acid equivalent was 678.2 mg/100 g, whereas it was 368.7 mg/100 g as gallic acid equivalent.

Fresh and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest total phenolic contents (393.1+/-10.8 mg and 366.3+/-3.6 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh sample, respectively). Fresh and pickled red cabbages were also highest in flavonoids (108.1+/-9.3 mg and 72.4+/-4.4 mg catechin equivalents/100 g fresh sample, respectively). The antioxidant capacity (expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity) ranged from 57.1 to 695.6 mg vitamin C equivalents/100 g fresh sample, where raw and pickled red cabbages exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity. There was a good linear relationship between the total phenolics and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9743), and between the total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity (r2=0.9557); however, the relationship between the ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity was very low (r2=0.1442). The antioxidant capacity of raw and processed cabbages was highly correlated with their contents of polyphenolics. Kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin were the major flavonoids existing in cabbages except for raw and pickled red cabbages, where cyanidin was the predominant flavonoid (73.6-117.7 mg/kg). In the red cabbages, cyanidin was the major contributor to the antioxidant capacity as well as the content of total phenolics and flavonoids.","218.0"
"Daily consumption of phenolics and total antioxidant capacity from fruit and vegetables in the American diet","","The daily intake of total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidants in the American diet was estimated from the most common 34 fresh fruit and vegetables and their daily consumption data. Among 14 fruit and 20 vegetables, orange contributed the highest amount of total phenolics [117.1 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) person(-1) day(-1)] and antioxidants [146.6 mg vitamin C equivalents (VCE) person(-1) day(-1)]. Orange contributed about 26 and 25% of total phenolics and antioxidant, respectively, in the daily consumption of fruit and vegetables. Apples showed relatively high levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity comparable to those of oranges and their phenolics and antioxidants contribution is the second highest. Even though potatoes had lower levels of phenolics and antioxidant capacity, they were third due to the fact that their consumption is the highest (137.9 lb person(-1) year(-1)) in the American diet. Although plums and strawberries were ranked as the group with the highest total phenolics and antioxidant capacity among 34 tested fruit and vegetables, their contributions were relatively low due to their lower daily consumption. Generally, the levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidant capacity of fruits were higher than those of vegetables. American daily intake of phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidants from fruits and vegetables was estimated to be 450 mg GAE, 103 mg catechin equivalents and 591 mg VCE, respectively. Although we do not yet know the required minimum daily amounts of antioxidants, when we estimate the daily requirement of antioxidants, we must consider not only the antioxidant concentrations of the particular food, but also the daily intakes of the food.","219.0"

"An LC-MS method to determine concentrations of isoflavones and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates in urine","10509897.0","Most methods for detecting isoflavones in biological samples do not measure the concentration of sulfate conjugates. An LC-MS method is reported here to estimate urinary concentrations of genistein and daidzein, their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates and other major metabolites. Human and rat urine samples were extracted with diethyl ether, or pre-digested with sulfatase and/or beta-glucuronidase followed by extraction. The isoflavones were separated using gradient LC methods and detected by negative single ion monitoring on an MS system using a heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. CVs for inter- and intra-assay variability were generally < 20 and 10%, respectively. Preliminary studies using these procedures demonstrate 52+/-4 and 26+/-4% of genistein in rat urine was found as the aglycone and sulfate conjugates, respectively, compared to 0.36 and 4%, respectively, in human urine. This method is suitable for the study of isoflavone sulfate conjugates in biological fluids.","221.0"
"Measurement of intact sulfate and glucuronide phytoestrogen conjugates in human urine using isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with [13C(3)]isoflavone internal standards","12381375.0","A method has been developed for the analysis of phytoestrogens and their conjugates in human urine using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Stable isotopically labeled [13C(3)]daidzein and [13C(3)]genistein were synthesized and used as internal standards for isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Free aglycons and intact glucuronide, sulfate, diglucuronide, disulfate, and mixed sulfoglucuronide conjugates of isoflavones and lignans were observed in naturally incurred urine samples. Sample pretreatment was not necessary, other than addition of internal standards and pH adjustment. Urine was injected directly onto the analytical column. The limits of detection were generally <50ng/ml, precision was generally <10% CV for conjugates. Total hydrolyzed daidzein and genistein were measured against quality assurance urine sample and were accurate to within 12%. The accuracy of conjugate measurement can not be ascertained, as no reference samples are available. The mean sum of daidzein and its conjugates was within 20% of the hydrolyzed value. Concentrations of the free aglycons of up to 22% of genistein and 18% of daidzein were observed. The average pattern was ca. 54% 7-glucuronide, 25% 4(')-glucuronide, 13% monosulfates, 7% free daidzein, 0.9% sulfoglucuronides, 0.4% diglucuronide, and <0.1% disulfate. Selective enzymatic deconjugation with glucuronidase and mixed glucuronidase/sulfatase were used to validate the accuracy of the quantitation of the intact daidzein conjugates. There were no apparent sex differences, or conditioning effects on the conjugation profile of isoflavones after chronic dosing.","222.0"
"Determination of unusual soya and non-soya phytoestrogen sources in beer, fish products and other foods","15712520.0","Fish and fish products (14 samples), Indian foods and meals (10 samples), spices (30 samples) and beers (10 samples) were analysed for their phytoestrogen content, and a number of significant non-soya sources of dietary phytoestrogens were identified. No isoflavones were detected in unprocessed, farmed or ocean fish, but some samples of processed fish products contained soya isoflavones, which are assumed to come from coatings or protein addition. Additionally, some processed fish products contained, genistein glycocongugates not derived from soya. Genistein was detected in Indian meals such that, for example, a single portion of a vindalooo curry contained 11 mg genistein. The origin was most likely from the spices used, since the analysis of curry powders, chilli powder, crushed red chillies, garam masala and tandoori powder revealed that some contained genistein at more than 100 mg kg(-1). Cumin was the most likely source material, although not all individual samples of cumin tested contained high levels of genistein. Prenylnaringenin phytoestrogens were determined in UK hop-based beers at mean concentrations of 0.21 mg(-1) 6-prenylnaringenin and 0.06mg(-1) 8-prenylnaringenin. The beers also contained traces of daidzein, genistein and biochanin A. The significance of 'hidden soya' in processed foods and these non-soya sources of phytoestrogens is that UK dietary intake of phytoestrogens must be assumed to be higher than estimated previously and that some sources of phytoestrogens remain poorly characterized.","223.0"
"The chlorogenic acids content of coffee substitutes","","With the growing interest in natural and health-supporting foods, oak acorns (<i>Quercus robur</i>) are gaining renewed attention for their nutritional and antioxidant potential. This study explored how different processing methods affect bioactive compounds in three acorn-based products: raw acorn flour, roasted ""coffee,"" and washed-and-roasted ""super coffee."" Extracts were obtained using methanol, acetone, and hexane to evaluate total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant activity via ABTS, DPPH, CUPRAC, FRAP, and TRP assays. Methanol proved to be the most effective solvent, extracting up to 66.53 mg GAE/g dw of phenolics in raw flour and 76.50 mg GAE/g dw in roasted ""coffee,"" reflecting a 15% increase in TPC after thermal treatment. However, the same treatment resulted in a 17% decrease in flavonoid content, from 181.5 mg RE/g dw in raw flour to 150.67 mg RE/g dw in ""super coffee."" Antioxidant activity followed a similar pattern, with methanol extracts showing the highest values, up to 584 mg TE/g dw in the CUPRAC assay and 126.7 mg TE/g dw in ABTS. Safety was also assessed through the quantification of 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The total PAH levels in the roasted ""coffee"" and ""super coffee"" samples were 222 ng/g dw and 290 ng/g dw, respectively. Importantly, PAH4 compounds, used as key safety indicators in EU regulations, were present in low concentrations, primarily as benzo[a]anthracene (34.3-39.8 ng/g), and none exceeded the maximum limits established for cocoa-based products. Benzo[a]pyrene, a major carcinogen, was not detected. The results confirm that acorns of <i>Quercus robur</i>, especially in their native flour form, are rich in antioxidants, naturally gluten-free, and safe when thermally processed, making them a strong candidate for use in functional foods.","224.0"
"Hippuric acid as a major excretion product associated with black tea consumption","10752646.0","1. Nine habitual tea-drinking volunteers were recruited and asked to follow a low-polyphenol and low-caffeine diet for 6 days and to provide daily 24-h urine samples. On day 4 of the experiment strong black tea brewed under standardized conditions was re-introduced to the volunteers' diet. 2. 1H-NMR and HPLC profiling of the urine samples indicated that consumption of black tea (6-10 mugs per day) was associated with a significant (p = 0.00017) increase in hippuric acid excretion relative to control, increasing from 153-512 to 742-1374 mg day(-1). The excretion of substantial amounts of hippuric acid has not previously been associated with black tea consumption. 3. For some volunteers, the quantity of benzoic acid processed exceeded the acceptable daily intake (ADI), but this is not considered to constitute any hazard. 4. A mass-balance analysis indicated that the necessary quantity of benzoic acid could not be obtained from the contents of gallic acid, flavanols, flavonol glycosides and theaflavins in black tea even if 100% transformation was obtained, suggesting that the thearubigins (the major and chemically ill-defined polyphenols of black tea) may be an important source.","225.0"
"Ferulic acid release and 4-vinylguaiacol formation during brewing and ferrmentation: indications for feruloyl estrease activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae","14759156.0","The release of ferulic acid and the subsequent thermal or enzymatic decarboxylation to 4-vinylguaiacol are inherent to the beer production process. Phenolic, medicinal, or clove-like flavors originating from 4-vinylguaiacol frequently occur in beer made with wheat or wheat malt. To evaluate the release of ferulic acid and the transformation to 4-vinylguaiacol, beer was brewed with different proportions of barley malt, wheat, and wheat malt. Ferulic acid as well as 4-vinylguaiacol levels were determined by HPLC at several stages of the beer production process. During brewing, ferulic acid was released at the initial mashing phase, whereas moderate levels of 4-vinylguaiacol were formed by wort boiling. Higher levels of the phenolic flavor compound were produced during fermentations with brewery yeast strains of the Pof(+) phenotype. In beer made with barley malt, ferulic acid was mainly released during the brewing process. Conversely, 60-90% of ferulic acid in wheat or wheat malt beer was hydrolyzed during fermentation, causing higher 4-vinylguaiacol levels in these beers. As cereal enzymes are most likely inactivated during wort boiling, the additional release of ferulic acid during fermentation suggests the activity of feruloyl esterases produced by brewer's yeast.","226.0"
"Phenolic acids, syringaldehyde, and juglone in fruits of different cultivars of juglans regia L","16076123.0","Phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, ellagic, and syringic acid) as well as syringaldehyde and juglone were identified in ripe fruits of 10 walnut cultivars: Adams, Cisco, Chandler, Franquette, Lara, Fernor, Fernette, Alsoszentivani 117 (A-117), Rasna, and Elit. Analyses were done using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector. Significant differences in the contents of identified phenolics were observed among cultivars. Phenolics were determined separately in the kernel and in the thin skin of the walnut, termed the pellicle. Not only in the kernel but also in the pellicle did syringic acid, juglone, and ellagic acid predominate (average values of 33.83, 11.75, and 5.90 mg/100 g of kernel; and 1003.24, 317.90, and 128.98 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively), and the contents of ferulic and sinapic acid (average values of 0.06 and 0.05 mg/100 g of kernel and 2.93 and 2.17 mg/100 g of pellicle, respectively) were the lowest in all cultivars. The highest differences in the sum of all identified phenolics were observed between Rasna and Fernette fruits; in Rasna there were >2-fold higher contents of identified phenolics in both kernel and pellicle. It was found that the walnut pellicle is the most important source of walnut phenolics. The ratio between the contents in pellicle and kernel varied by at least 14.8-fold for caffeic acid (cv. Adams) and by up to 752.0-fold for p-coumaric acid (cv. Elit).","227.0"
"Biotransformation of genistein in the rat: elucidation of metabolite structure by product ion mass fragmentology","10622405.0","Biotransformation of the phytoestrogen [14C]genistein was investigated in male and female rats by application of narrow-bore radio-HPLC-MSn (LCQ, Finnigan) to determine intermediates in metabolism. Urine contained five metabolites, Gm1-Gm5, 24 h after dosing by gavage with [14C]genistein (4 mg kg(-1)). Structural analysis following ESI revealed molecular ions [M+H]+ of m/z 447, 449, 273, and 271 for metabolites Gm2, Gm3, Gm5 and genistein, respectively and an [M-H]- of m/z 349 for Gm4. Metabolite structure was deduced by evaluation of product ion spectra derived from unlabelled and [14C]-labelled ions and sensitivity to treatment with beta-glucuronidase. These studies indicated identity of metabolites with genistein glucuronide (Gm2), dihydrogenistein glucuronide (Gm3), genistein sulphate (Gm4) and dihydrogenistein (Gm5). Detection of the beta-glucuronidase resistant major metabolite Gm1 by ESI was poor and so was analysed by negative ion APCI; this revealed a deprotonated molecular ion of m/z 165 which had chromatographic and mass spectral properties consistent with authentic 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-propionic acid, a novel metabolite of genistein. In vitro metabolism studies with anaerobic caecal cultures derived from male and female rats revealed metabolism of genistein to Gm1 via Gm5 and an additional metabolite (Gm6) which was identified from product ion spectra as 6'-hydroxy-O-desmethylangolensin. Biotransformation of genistein by both isolated hepatocytes and precision-cut liver slices was limited to glucuronidation of parent compound. Commonality of genistein metabolites found in rats with those reported in man suggest similar pathways of biotransformation, primarily involving gut micro-flora.","228.0"
"Changes in capsaicinoids during development, maturation, and senescence of chile peppers and relation with peroxidase activity","","The components responsible for chile hot flavor, capsaicinoids, are synthesized through the cinnamic acid pathway, and their degradation is thought to be aided by the action of peroxidases. This work describes the evolution of capsaicinoids during the development, maturation, and senescence of the fruit in three varieties of hot chile peppers widely used in Mexico [Habanero (Capsicum chinense Jacq.), De arbol (C. annuum var. Annuum), and Piquin (C. annuum var. Aviculare)] and its relation with the activity of peroxidases in these fruits. Capsaicinoids were more abundant in the fruit of Habanero, followed by De arbol and then by Piquin. Capsaicin was higher than dihydrocapsaicin in the three varieties. Capsaicinoids, capsaicin, and dihydrocapsaicin increased continuously and reached a peak after 45-50 days from fruit set (DFFS) in Habanero and De arobol and after 40 DFFS in Piquin and then declined. Peroxidase activity increased at the time when the concentration of capsaicinoids started to decrease. There was an inverse relationship between the evolution of capsaicinoids and peroxidase activity that might indicate that this enzyme is involved in capsaicinoid degradation.","229.0"
"Development of analyses by high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtilus) anthocyanins in human plasma and urine","16968056.0","Anthocyanins are potent antioxidants that may possess chronic disease preventive properties. Here, rapid, reliable, and reproducible solid-phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and mass spectrometry techniques are described for the isolation, separation, and identification of anthocyanins in human plasma and urine.

"LC-MS identification of anthocyanins in boysenberry extract and anthocyanin metabolites in human urine following dosing","","The anthocyanin composition of boysenberry (Rubusloganbaccus x baileyanus Britt) extract was determined by LC-ESI-MS. Four anthocyanins were identified, all comprising a cyanidin-anthocyanidin-type skeleton. The two major components were identified as the disaccharide cyanidin-3-O-sophoroside and the monosaccharide cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. The two less abundant components were identified as the rutinosides, cyanidin-3-O-2G-glucosylrutinoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, respectively. These same four anthocyanins were also detected in human urine following a dosing study with boysenberry extract indicating that glycosylated anthocyanins can be absorbed from the gut and excreted intact in the urine. Several anthocyanin metabolites were also detected in the urine and were identified by LC-ESI-MS as monoglucuronides of peonidin, cyanidin and pelargonidin. The results suggest that anthocyanins consumed as part of a diet are bioavailable and are present as intact or metabolized forms in the body.","231.0"
"Rapid reversed phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the major cocoa polyphenols and inter-relationships of their concentrations in chocolate","17362030.0","Chocolate and other cocoa-containing products are a rich source of polyphenols. This paper describes an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method that can separate and quantify in 3 min six of the major chocolate polyphenols: catechin; epicatechin; B2 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); B5 (epicatechin-4beta-6-epicatechin); C1 (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin); and tetramer D (epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin-4beta-8-epicatechin). A survey of 68 chocolate samples indicated that there was a strongly predictive relationship between epicatechin and the other individual polyphenols, especially procyanidin B2 (R 2 = 0.989), even though the chocolates came from varied sources and manufacturers. The relationship was less strong with catechin, and so further work to explore the reasons for this difference was performed. Chiral analysis on a subset of 23 chocolates showed that (-)-epicatechin had a predictive relationship with (+)-catechin in line with the other polyphenols, but not with (-)-catechin (the predominant form). This indicates that (-)-catechin is the most affected by manufacturing conditions, possibly formed through epimerization from (-)-epicatechin during processing. The results show that epicatechin concentrations can be used to predict the content of other polyphenols, especially B2 and C1, and total polyphenols content. Finally, the (-)-catechin content is not predictable from the epicatechin content, and it is concluded that this is the main form of polyphenol that varies according to manufacturing conditions and cocoa origin.","232.0"

"Effects of temperature on the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of three strawberry cultivars","","Three strawberry cultivars (Dover, Campineiro, and Oso Grande), grown in the same commercial plantation, were harvested at the ripe stage and stored at 6, 16 and 25 degrees C, for 6 days. During this period, chemical composition and antioxidant activity were evaluated. Results showed an increase in total soluble sugars, anthocyanin and vitamin C contents, indicating that a new biosynthesis had taken place during storage. Low temperature negatively affected anthocyanin and vitamin C accumulation, and positively affected soluble sugars, while flavonols, ellagic acid and total phenolic contents remained almost the same or even decreased at all temperatures. Despite differences in anthocyanin content between varieties and its increase during storage (higher with increasing temperature), there was no difference in the antioxidant activity between cultivars, which decreased after harvesting, independently of the temperature of storage. Variations in the proportion dehydroascorbic acid/ascorbic acid (DHA/AA) showed that there were differences between cultivars concerning adaptation of the fruit to low temperatures. The data obtained here indicate that cold storage is an effective way to maintain strawberry quality, but a compromise between sensorial and nutritional values can be achieved at 16 degrees C, for all the cultivars.","236.0"

"Stability of anthocyanins of blue maize (Zea mays L.) after nixtamalization of seperated pericarp-germ tip cap and endosperm fractions","","Most naturally occurring foods that are sources of anthocyanins are often processed under severe temperature, pressure, and pH conditions that may extensively alter the naturally occurring pigments with loss of their potential antioxidant properties. It is desirable that anthocyanins present in pigmented maize not be completely destroyed when producing processed products. In the present study, the effect of different concentrations of calcium hydroxide used in the nixtamalization after fractionation process on the stability of the pigments found in blue maize was evaluated. The anthocyanin profile was analyzed using HPLC. The total anthocyanin content as well as that of acyl-type anthocyanins decreased during the cooking process and as the concentrations of calcium hydroxide used increased (P<0.001). More anthocyanin was retained in the nixtamalization after fractionation process with 0.5% calcium hydroxide than in the traditional nixtamalization process. In maize cooked and nixtamalized with up to 1.5% calcium hydroxide, only 16.1% of the acyl-type anthocyanin remained, compared to between 32 and 38% in the original uncooked maize.

"Effects of juice processing on cranberry antioxidant properties","","The effects of the industrial juice process on the antioxidant capacities of cranberry samples and of three phenolic extracts (polar phenolics (E1), apolar phenolics (E2) and anthocyanins (E3)) adjusted at pH 2.5 and 7.0 were investigated. The free radical-scavenging (FRS) and the lipid peroxidation inhibition (LPI) activities of each sample and extract, were studied using a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine discoloration test and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances assay, respectively. The FRS and the LPI results, expressed in mM Trolox® equivalent (TE)/mg phenol and mg TE/mL/mg phenol, respectively, showed a negative effect of the juice process steps on E1. The E2 and E3 extracts were also affected by the process but not as much. The milling step increased the FRS capacity of E2 and E3 extracts, but decreased their LPI capacity. The evaporation of the juice did not have a significant effect on the FRS capacity, but lowered the LPI capacity. Before and after each step of the juice process, the FRS capacity of the cranberry extracts was greater than the LPI capacity. The results were consistent in classifying the FRS capacity of the extracts in the following order of polarity: E1>E3>E2; and their total phenolic (TP) content in the following order: E3>E2>E1. In general, the neutralization of the pH of the extracts did not significantly influence the changes observed during the juice process in the FRS and LPI capacity, except for E3 for which a decrease in the LPI capacity was observed.","239.0"

Cherry tomatoes contained 17-203 micrograms of quercetin g-1 fresh weight compared to 2.2-11 micrograms g-1 detected in normal-sized Scottish, Spanish, and Dutch beef tomatoes. The quercetin levels in onions ranged from 185 to 634 micrograms of quercetin g-1 fresh weight. ""Round"" lettuce contained 11 micrograms of quercetin g-1 fresh weight compared to 911 micrograms g-1 in the outer leaves and 450 mg g-1 in the inner leaves of ""Lollo Rosso"" lettuce. The conjugated flavonoid content of celery was very variable, ranging from undetectable to 40 micrograms of luteolin and 191 micrograms of apigenin g-1 fresh weight. Cooking lowered the quercetin content of both tomatoes and onions with greater reductions being detected following microwaving and boiling than after frying.","242.0"
"Effect of Processing on Taste Quality and Health-Relevant Functionality of Sweet Potato Tips","","<h4>Background</h4><i>Gymnadenia conopsea</i> (L.) R. Br., a medicinally significant orchid used for millennia in China, is systematically reviewed regarding its botany, resources, ethnomedicinal applications, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and propagation strategies to advance therapeutic utilization and conservation.<h4>Methods</h4>Using keywords such as ""<i>G. conopsea</i>,"" ""phytochemistry,"" ""propagation and breeding,"" ""bioactive compounds,"" ""immunomodulatory effects,"" and ""neuroprotective potential,"" we systematically searched literature related to <i>G. conopsea</i> plants from databases including Web of Science, SciFinder, PubMed, ACS Publications, CNKI, Wanfang Data, Google Scholar, and Baidu Scholar.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1,074 papers were retrieved and 133 full-text articles were ultimately selected and comprehensively reviewed. Up to now, over 203 metabolites have been identified in the tubers of <i>G. conopsea</i>, including benzyl ester glucosides, stilbenoids, phenanthrenes, phenolic derivatives, alkaloids and polysaccharides. Pharmacological studies validate its multi-target therapeutic potential across tonification, anti-fatigue interventions, oxidative stress mitigation, antiviral defense, and management of gastric ulcers and silicosis. Despite extensive research on the pharmacological properties of crude extracts, the relationship between specific bioactive compounds and their corresponding pharmacological activities, particularly <i>in vivo</i>, remains poorly understood. Critically, overexploitation and habitat degradation have led to its classification as an endangered species. Current propagation efforts face significant challenges, including low natural germination rates, and dependence on specific habitats and obligate mycorrhizal fungi, precluding the development of efficient large-scale cultivation and seedling production systems.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Marked progress has been made in characterizing small-molecule metabolites of <i>G. conopsea</i>, yet comprehensive structural elucidation of polysaccharides remains incomplete. Additionally, research must be intensified on synergistic interactions of bioactive constituents, molecular targets, mechanisms of action, and <i>in vivo</i> metabolic pathways to facilitate development of a quality standard system. For propagation, wild-simulated cultivation should be adopted for resource conservation, while optimizing symbiotic germination techniques is critical to overcome propagation bottlenecks, ultimately enabling sustainable utilization.","243.0"
"Antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds in the edible parts of early and late italian artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) varieties","","<h4>Background</h4>The globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L.) is extensively cultivated in the Mediterranean region, with Italy being a leading producer. Industrial processing of artichoke plants generates substantial amounts of residual materials, which are discarded annually. This accumulation of biowaste presents environmental challenges. However, these by-products remain rich in phytochemicals, such as dietary fibers, phenolic acids, sesquiterpene lactones, flavonoids, vitamins and minerals, similar to those found in the edible parts of the plant. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of artichoke by-products by analyzing aqueous extracts (AEs) from seven cultivars, comprising two commercial hybrids and five local varieties, focusing on their phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and prebiotic potential.<h4>Results</h4>The primary phenolic compounds identified in the AEs were hydroxycinnamates, notably 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and flavonoids, primarily apigenin-7-O-rutinoside, luteolin and luteolin-7-O-rutinoside. These bioactive compounds were more abundant in two of the five local varieties, with concentrations exceeding those in commercial hybrids by more than twofold. Local varieties consistently exhibited higher total phenolic content and greater antioxidant activity, as determined by the DPPH (i.e. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrilyhydrazil) assay. Furthermore, local varieties demonstrated a remarkable prebiotic potential, supporting more robust probiotic cell growth and resulting in greater acidification compared to commercial hybrids.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings highlight the potential for valorizing artichoke biowastes as dietary supplements. The rich functional and bioactive properties of these by-products, particularly in local varieties, offer promising applications in food-related industries. This approach not only leverages their nutritional benefits, but also addresses environmental concerns by valorizing biowaste. © 2025 The Author(s).

"Effect of bruising on the total glycoalkaloid and chlorogenic acid content of potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers of five cultivars","","Tubers from five potato cultivars were selected on the basis of their low, intermediate or high rates of glycoalkaloid synthesis in response to stresses such as light or cold storage temperatures. The tubers were subjected to a standard degree of damage sufficient to cause bruising but not severe damage such as cracking or splitting. Increases in glycoalkaloid levels in response to damage were observed in all cultivars. Importantly, the rates of glycoalkaloid synthesis in response to damage were in good agreement with cultivar response to light and cold temperature stress. The cultivars, Ailsa and Eden, exhibited a slower response than the higher synthesis rates observed in Pentland Dell or Brodick. The cultivar Torridon exhibited severe internal damage symptoms throughout the tuber as opposed to localised bruising observed in the other cultivars. The extensive cell death observed in the tubers of the cultivar Torridon severely curtailed glycoalkaloid and chlorogenic acid synthesis. The increased levels of glycoalkaloids in response to bruising damage ranged from approximately 27% (Ailsa, Torridon) to 130% for the cultivar Brodick. Chlorogenic acid levels increased in two cultivars (Brodick and Torridon) but not in the others, Ailsa, Eden and Pentland Dell. The alpha-chaconine/alpha-solanine ratios observed within the five cultivars were in good agreement with previous research. The consistency across years is notable, indicating a strong relationship in the synthesis of the two glycoalkaloids. The results are discussed in terms of implications for the potato industry, for the retail trade and also for selection within potato breeding","247.0"
"Extraction, stability, and quantitation of ellagic acid in various fruits and nuts","","Recent advancements in analytical strategies have enabled the efficient extraction and characterization of bioactive compounds from agri-food bio-residues, emphasizing green chemistry and circular economy principles. This review highlights the valorization of several agri-food bio-residues for the extraction of high-value-added bioactive compounds, particularly polyphenols, tocopherols, carotenoids, and fatty acids, as a biorefinery approach. To this end, the adoption of environmentally friendly extraction technologies is essential to improve performance, reduce energy consumption, and minimize costs. This study therefore examines emerging methodologies such as supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, pulsed electric fields, and matrix solid-phase dispersion, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Additionally, the chemical characterization of these bioactive compounds is explored through spectrophotometric and high-resolution chromatographic techniques, crucial for their accurate identification and quantification. This is complemented by an analysis of bioactivity assays evaluating antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties, with a focus on their applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. However, the analytical control of toxic compounds, such as alkaloids, in these bio-residues is undoubtedly needed. Ultimately, this approach not only promotes sustainability but also contributes to the development of eco-friendly solutions in various industries.","248.0"
"Chlorogenic acid content of fresh and processed potatoes determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry","","Chlorogenic acid is reported to be involved in preharvest defenses of the potato plant against  fungi and insects, in postharvest browning, and in after-cooking blackening, all of which affect  quality and safety. As part of a program of potato improvement, HPLC and ultraviolet spectroscopy  were evaluated to measure the chlorogenic content of commercial and experimental potatoes, of  parts of the potato plant, and of processed potato products. HPLC analysis appears to be less  satisfactory because chlorogenic acid undergoes a time- and light-dependent change in the  methanolic and ethanolic extracts of potatoes used. The decrease of the chlorogenic acid peak on  chromatograms was accompanied by a corresponding increase of a new peak. Use of ultraviolet  spectrophotometry to estimate chlorogenic acid by contrast appears to be reproducible. Recoveries  of spiked samples measured by UV were higher than those measured by HPLC. Thus, our results  suggest that the UV method may have advantages over HPLC. Seven varieties of potatoes contained  from 10 to 19 mg of chlorogenic acid/100 g of fresh weight. The experimental potato plant NDA  1725 contained 754 mg/100 g of fresh weight for sprouts, 224 mg/100 g for leaves, 26 mg/100 g for  roots, and 17 mg/100 g for tubers. The relative concentrations paralleled those of the  glycoalkaloids alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine. Oven-baked potatoes contained 0% of the  original amount of chlorogenic acid, boiled potatoes 35%, and microwaved potatoes 55%.  Commercially processed french-fried potatoes, mashed potato flakes, and potato skins contained no  chlorogenic acid. The absence of chlorogenic acid was confirmed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and thin-layer chromatography. The significance of these findings for plant physiology, food  quality, and food safety is discussed.","249.0"
"Identification of isomeric flavonoid glucuronides in urine and plasma by metal complexation and LC-ESI-MS/MS","16810646.0","Noncovalent complexes were used for structural determination and isomer differentiation of flavonoid glucuronides. Several flavonoid glucuronides including naringenin-7-O-glucuronide, synthesized here for the first time, were used as test compounds. Electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation (CID) was used to analyze complexes of the form [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)]+ and [Co(II) (L-H) (Aux)2]+, in which L is the flavonoid glucuronide and Aux is a phenanthroline-based ligand. These complexes yielded characteristic fragmentation patterns that facilitated assignment of the substitution position of the glucuronides. The methods were adapted to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with postcolumn cobalt complexation and were tested on extracts from biological fluids. The metabolites naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide were detected in human urine following the consumption of grapefruit juice. Isomeric quercetin glucuronides were identified and differentiated after spiking rat plasma at the 1 microM level, proving that the new methods are effective at biologically relevant concentrations.","250.0"
"Phenolic composition of kiwifruit juice","10794642.0","Phenolic compounds in kiwifruit pulp were separated and characterized by reversed-phase HPLC, and the effect of juice processing on the phenolic composition was studied. Fractionation of phenolic compounds was achieved through selective elution from C-18 cartridges prior to preconcentration and subsequent separation by HPLC. Strongly acidic compounds were identified as derivatives of coumaric and caffeic acids, including chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, and a derivative of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The weakly acidic fraction contained epicatechin, catechin, and procyanidins (B3, B2, or B4 and oligomers). Flavonols were present as the glycosides of quercetin (glucoside, rhamnoside, and rutinoside) and kaempferol (rhamnoside and rutinoside). Phenolic compounds were present, at levels of <1-7 mg/L, in clarified juice. The concentration of phenolics was highest after high-temperature short-time treatment (HTST) of juice. Hydrolysis of hydroxycinnamic acids occurred after enzyme addition and HTST treatment. The flavonol glycoside composition is the best identifier of kiwifruit juice.","251.0"
"Human metabolism of dietary flavonoids: identification of plasma metabolites of quercetin","11811545.0","The position of conjugation of the flavonoid quercetin dramatically affects biological activity in vitro, therefore it is important to determine the exact nature of the plasma metabolites. In the present study, we have used various methods (HPLC with diode array detection, LCMS, chemical and enzymic synthesis of authentic conjugates and specific enzymic hydrolysis) to show that quercetin glucosides are not present in plasma of human subjects 1.5 h after consumption of onions (a rich source of flavonoid glucosides). All four individuals had similar qualitative profiles of metabolites. The major circulating compounds in the plasma after 1.5 h are identified as quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin-3'-sulfate. The existence of substitutions in the B and/or C ring of plasma quercetin metabolites suggests that these conjugates will each have very different biological activities.","252.0"
"Differentiation of raspberry varieties according to anthocyanin composition","","The aim of this study was to compare the antioxidant potential in the fruits of different hybrids of <i>Rubus idaeus</i> and <i>Rubus occidentalis</i> (four hybrids) against the fruit of known cultivars of both species (<i>R. idaeus</i>-three cultivars; <i>R. occidentalis</i>-five cultivars) and, using chemometric analysis, to select factors affecting the level of polyphenols and antioxidant properties. Antioxidant activity was determined using the ABTS, DPPH and FRAP tests. Chemometric analysis enabled the separation of <i>R. idaeus</i> and <i>R. occidentalis</i> cultivars and classified the hybrid <i>R. idaeus</i>/<i>R. occidentalis</i> R1314701 as belonging to the <i>R. occidentalis</i> species. Moreover, two hybrids, <i>Rubus occidentalis</i>/<i>Rubus idaeus</i> R1613411 and <i>R. idaeus</i>/<i>R. occidentalis</i> R1613409, can be classified as a purple raspberry. Crossbreeding species/cultivars of the <i>Rubus</i> genus may result in an increased content of anthocyanins, but on the other hand, it may lead to a reduction in free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and DPPH. Spearman's correlations confirm the correlations between the total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity in the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP, as well as the anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity in the ABTS and FRAP tests. Chemometric analysis can be an effective tool in determining the species affiliation of obtained hybrids and cultivars.","253.0"
"Structural and chemical changes in cocoa (Theobroma cacao L) during fermentation, drying and roasting","","Cocoa seeds and pulp were fermented for 144h, followed by natural drying. The tegument was removed and the cotyledons were broken into nibs which were roasted at 150 degrees C for 30 min. Non-fermented material, material fermented for 24, 48 and 72h, material fermented for 144h and then dried, and also the roasted nibs, were all prepared for chemical and microscopic analyses. Light microscopy revealed the presence of anionic and cationic residues and of neutral sugars. During fermentation there was a reduction in the cytoplasmic content of phenolic compounds and in the number of protein bodies. The cell wall showed a reduction in anionic residues and a loss of crystallinity. These alterations were maximum after 72h. Drying and roasting increased the number of damaged cells and reduced the amount of cytoplasmic material. The chemical analyses generally confirmed the microscopy results. The concentration of amino-terminal groups and total free amino acids increased during fermentation (up to 72h), but returned to the initial values after roasting. The principal chemical changes were related to reducing sugars, free amino acids, proteins and phenols, and PCA was suggested as a useful tool to compare different samples. Microscopic analysis revealed the degradation of protein and phenolic bodies and cellular damage during roasting.","254.0"

"Effect of processing on the phytochemical profiles and antioxidant activity of corn for production of masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips","17455952.0","The phytochemical profiles (total phenolics, anthocyanins, ferulic acid, carotenoids) and antioxidant activities of five types of corn (white, yellow, high carotenoid, blue, and red) processed into masa, tortillas, and tortilla chips were studied. The nixtamalization process significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total phenolics and antioxidant activities when compared to raw grains. Nixtamalized grains exhibited higher concentration of free phenolics and soluble conjugated ferulic acid and had lower concentrations of bound phenolics and ferulic acid than unprocessed grains. Among processed products, there was little difference in the phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities. Among types of corn, the highest concentrations of total phenolics, ferulic acid, and antioxidant activity were observed in the high-carotenoid genotype followed by the regular yellow counterpart. The white corn contained the lowest amount of total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The pigmented blue corn had the highest anthocyanin concentration followed by the red counterpart. These findings suggest that lime-cooking significantly reduced the phytochemical content of nixtamalized products but released phenolics and ferulic acid.","256.0"

"Presence of virgin olive oil phenolic metabolites in human low density lipoprotein fraction: determination by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry","17386573.0","The biological benefits of olive oil in preventing the oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) would seem to be linked to its high monounsaturated fatty acid contents, but also to its respective phenolic compounds contents. One prerequisite to assess the in vivo physiological significance of phenolic compounds is to determine their presence in human LDL following the ingestion of virgin olive oil. In this work, olive oil phenolic metabolites were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography in tandem with electrospray mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) detection, after solid phase extraction (SPE). Quantitative methods were developed in carrying out linearity, precision, sensitivity and recovery tests. The results from two methods of LDL separation were compared and shorter LDL isolation procedure showed a better recovery for antioxidants compounds in LDL. The metabolites identified in LDL were: hydroxytyrosol monoglucuronide, hydroxytyrosol monosulfate, tyrosol glucuronide, tyrosol sulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate. The fact that olive oil phenolic metabolites are able to bind LDL strengthens claims that these compounds act as in vivo antioxidants.","259.0"
"Elevated circulating LDL phenol levels in men who consumed virgin rather than refined olive oil are associated with less oxidation of plasma LDL","20089783.0","In human LDL, the bioactivity of olive oil phenols is determined by the in vivo disposition of the biological metabolites of these compounds. Here, we examined how the ingestion of 2 similar olive oils affected the content of the metabolic forms of olive oil phenols in LDL in men. The oils differed in phenol concentrations as follows: high (629 mg/L) for virgin olive oil (VOO) and null (0 mg/L) for refined olive oil (ROO). The study population consisted of a subsample from the EUROLIVE study and a randomized controlled, crossover design was used. Intervention periods lasted 3 wk and were preceded by a 2-wk washout period. The levels of LDL hydroxytyrosol monosulfate and homovanillic acid sulfate, but not of tyrosol sulfate, increased after VOO ingestion (P < 0.05), whereas the concentrations of circulating oxidation markers, including oxidized LDL (oxLDL), conjugated dienes, and hydroxy fatty acids, decreased (P < 0.05). The levels of LDL phenols and oxidation markers were not affected by ROO consumption. The relative increase in the 3 LDL phenols was greater when men consumed VOO than when they consumed ROO (P < 0.05), as was the relative decrease in plasma oxLDL (P = 0.001) and hydroxy fatty acids (P < 0.001). Plasma oxLDL concentrations were negatively correlated with the LDL phenol levels (r = -0.296; P = 0.013). Phenols in LDL were not associated with other oxidation markers. In summary, the phenol concentration of olive oil modulates the phenolic metabolite content in LDL after sustained, daily consumption. The inverse relationship of these metabolites with the degree of LDL oxidation supports the in vivo antioxidant role of olive oil phenolics compounds.","260.0"
"Oxidative stabilization of cold-pressed sunflower oil using phenolic compounds of the same seeds","","Berry seeds represent an underexploited byproduct of juice and wine production, and are increasingly valued sources of high-quality cold-pressed oils. In this study, eight berry species, including blackcurrant (<i>Ribes nigrum</i>), red currant (<i>Ribes rubrum</i>), raspberry (<i>Rubus idaeus</i>), strawberry (<i>Fragaria</i>), sea buckthorn (<i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i>), honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera caerulea</i>), viburnum (<i>Viburnum opulus</i>), and rowanberry (<i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>), were investigated to determine the impact of primary fermentation on seed composition and oil quality. Seeds obtained from juice production were compared with those obtained after fermentation. Fermentation consistently reduced seed sugars and carbohydrates by more than 50% while increasing relative protein levels, demonstrating microbial utilization of fermentable substrates. Oil yields showed species-specific responses, with blackcurrant and honeysuckle seeds increasing from ~14 to 15% and ~7 to 8%, respectively, while raspberry decreased from ~9 to 8%, and viburnum decreased from ~6 to 5%. Importantly, fatty acid profiles remained unchanged across all treatments, confirming that fermentation does not alter the natural dominance of linoleic and α-linolenic acids. Tocopherol and total phenolic contents decreased modestly in fermented oils (typically 5-10%), which was reflected in small reductions of DPPH scavenging activity (2-4%) and oxidative stability (0.2-0.5 h). A multivariate heatmap and PCA analyses revealed that berry species identity was the primary driver of biochemical variation, while fermentation introduced only minor within-species shifts. The results indicate that berry pomace remaining after fermentation can still be valorized for cold-pressed oil production with minimal compromise in quality.","261.0"
"Stability of 5-caffeoylquinic acid under different conditions of heating","","This study examined the impact of the extraction methods (70% ethanolic extraction, infusion) on the overall biological profile and concentration of phenolic compounds of <i>Ziziphora galinae (ZG)</i>. Infusion yielded significantly higher phenolics and flavonoids (75.73 ± 0.22 mg GAE/g and 8.87 ± 0.36 mg RE/g) than the ethanol extract (10.44 ± 0.1 and 2.44 ± 0.17, respectively). Nineteen key bioactive compounds, including caffeoylquinic acids, rutin, and p-coumaric acid, were identified. Both extracts exhibited strong antibacterial and moderate antifungal activity, but no notable cytotoxicity (IC50 > 400 μg/mL). Furthermore, <i>in silico</i> analyses involving molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM-PBSA free energy calculations revealed that the phytochemicals identified from ZG exhibited strong binding affinities and high structural stability against key human metabolic enzymes and essential bacterial proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis and DNA replication. Based on these results, the varying effects produced by the two extracts of endemic ZG may be attributed to the presence of distinct compounds, making them a valuable source of bioactive compounds to benefit human health.","262.0"
"Effect of cultivar and growing location on the trypsin inhibitors, tannins, and lectins of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) grown in the semiarid highlands of Mexico","13129302.0","Trypsin inhibitors (TI), tannins, and lectins appear to have a role in preventing chronic diseases in humans. The genetic variability of these traits in common bean needs to be ascertained in order to increase levels through breeding. The variability of TI, tannin, and lectins was determined in five bean cultivars grown at five locations in Mexico. TI and tannins contents in colored beans that belong to the Jalisco race were higher (11.1-11.9 trypsin units inhibited (TUI)/mg and 29.0-38.1 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g, respectively) than cultivars of the Durango race (7.9-8.3 TUI/mg and 16.8-19.9 CE/mg, respectively). Bayo Victoria, a Durango race cultivar, had three times more lectins than levels reported for soybean. Cultivar influenced TI and tannins contents (p < 0.001), whereas site affected lectins (p < 0.001). An increase in levels of TI and tannins could be enhanced through breeding.","263.0"

"Anthocyanin absorption, metabolism, and distribution from a wild blueberry-enriched diet (Vaccinium angustifolium) is affected by diet duration in the Sprague-Dawley rat","20030330.0","The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) (WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased in urine and not in feces after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion is based on diet duration.

Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate with a recovery for both compounds of about 100% in plasma and about 60% in urine. The chromatographic separation was performed with a RP-ODS column using a water-acetonitrile linear gradient. The calibration curve was linear for both biophenols over the range 2.5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 1.25 ng/ml) for plasma and 5-1000 ng/ml (LOD 2.5 ng/ml) for urine. Plasma concentrations of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol were measured after oral administration of a single dose (100 mg/kg) of oleuropein. Analysis of treated rat plasma showed the presence of unmodified oleuropein, reaching a peak value of 200 ng/ml within 2 h, with a small amount of hydroxytyrosol, whereas in urine, both compounds were mainly found as glucuronides.","266.0"
"Contribution of the phenolic fraction to the antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of olive oil","15212450.0","Antioxidant activity of the phenolic fraction of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was measured by means of a chemical and an electrochemical method. Both methods were tested in predicting the oxidative spoilage and stability to oxidation of 22 EVOO samples and resulted correlated with peroxide values and oxidative stability measured by Rancimat. The main phenolic compounds of EVOOs were detected by HRGC. To study the contribution of single polyphenols (PPs) to antioxidant activity of phenolic fraction and oxidative stability of EVOOs, multivariate statistical analyses were applied on HRGC data. An isomer of oleuropein aglycon was shown to affect significantly antioxidant activity of phenolic fraction but not oil stability to oxidation. No individual compounds was identified as the main cause of the overall antioxidant activity, and the total polyphenol determination by the Folin reagent was better correlated to antioxidant activity and oxidative stability than each tested PP or PPs groups such as o-diphenols.","267.0"
"Polyphenolic and antioxidant content of white and blue corn (Zea mays L.) products","","The polyphenolic and antioxidant content of white, Mexican blue, and American blue corns processed into nixtamal (cooked kernels), tortillas, and chips was investigated. A post-nixtamalization acidification treatment was assessed as a means to reduce polyphenolic and antioxidant losses. Similar anthocyanin composition (cyanidin 3-monoglycosides) and concentration (314 mg/kg) was observed for both blue corn genotypes as was their non-anthocyanin polyphenolic composition ((+)-catechin, free and esterified ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid derivatives). Six derivatives of ferulic acid (88.8-816 mg/kg) along with the free form (2480 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (6.6 mg/kg), two protocatechuic acid derivatives (4.2 and 14.2 mg/kg), and gallic acid (3.9 mg/kg) were identified in the white genotype. Both blue genotypes contained higher antioxidant capacity (>8.3 μmol Trolox equivalents/g) yet lower polyphenolic levels (3.6-4.4 g/kg) than the white genotype. Comparable anthocyanin losses were observed when the blue genotypes were processed into nixtamals (37%), tortillas (54%), and chips (78%) that correlated to polyphenolic (r = 0.91) and antioxidant capacity (r = 0.94) losses. Acidification was mainly effective in reducing anthocyanin (9-17%), polyphenolic (10%), and antioxidant capacity (6-14%) losses for the blue genotypes. This study compared polyphenolic and antioxidant content among corn genotypes and confirmed that acidification post-nixtamalization could reduce polyphenolic and antioxidant losses.","268.0"
"Polyphenolics and antioxidant capacity of white and blue corns processed into tortillas and chips","","White and blue corns of Mexican and American origins were lime-cooked to obtain nixtamals with optimal moisture (48-50%) for tortillas and chips. Blue kernels had less bulk density, softer endosperm and, consequently, required less cooking time than the white kernels. The optimum cooking regime for the white kernels was 100 degrees C for 20 min, while the optimum for both pigmented genotypes was 90 degrees C for 0 min (until the lime-cooking solution reached 90 degrees C). Doughs, tortillas, and chips were characterized by total soluble phenolics (TSP), anthocyanins (ACN), and antioxidant capacity (AOX). A dough acidification procedure using fumaric acid (pH 5.2) was assessed as a means to improve TSP, ACN, and AOX retention. The Mexican blue corn had higher AOX (16%) than the American blue genotype, although the latter had a threefold higher TSP content (12.1 g/kg, dwb). Mexican and American blue corns had higher AOX capacity (29.6 and 25.6 micromolar trolox equivalents TE/g dwb), respectively, than the white corn (17.4 micromolar TE/g). White corns did not have detectable amounts of ACN, while blue Mexican and American kernels contained 342 and 261 mg/kg. Lime cooking had the greatest negative impact on the stability of TSP, ACN, and AOX. However, the acidification reduced ACN, TSP, and AOX losses by 8-23, 3-14, and 4-15%, respectively. Similar ACN losses were observed for both types of blue kernels when processed into nixtamal/dough (47%); however, ACN losses in tortillas and chips manufactured from the American blue genotype were higher (63 and 81%, respectively) than those of Mexican blue corn products (54 and 75%). ACN losses were highly correlated to TSP (r = 0.91) and AOX capacity losses (r = 0.94).","269.0"
"Citrus limon: a source of flavonoids of pharmaceutical interest","","<h4>Purpose of the review</h4>Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is a multifactorial disorder affecting 12.5-31.4% of adults characterized by a cluster of conditions including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and dyslipidemia. Lifestyle and dietary interventions are essential components of its management. With growing interest in natural sources, citrus species are one source that has been traditionally used to treat the symptoms of MetSyn. This review paper aims to provide a comprehensive summary of preclinical and clinical studies to assess the effects of citrus species and their derived phytoconstituents, such as flavonoids, limonoids, and carotenoids, on key metabolic parameters. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of citrus species in the prevention and management of metabolic syndrome based on preclinical studies using essential oils and extracts, clinical studies, and the activity of their bioactive phytoconstituents.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Citrus species such as Citrus limon, Citrus medica, Citrus bergamia, Citrus aurantifolia, Citrus aurantium, Citrus grandis, Citrus maxima, Citrus sinensis, Citrus assamensis, Citrus sphaerocarpa, Citrus reticulata, Citrus japonica, and Citrus unshiu have been reported to treat metabolic syndrome. Preclinical studies demonstrate that citrus essential oils and extracts improve insulin sensitivity, reduce body weight and lipid levels, and aid in blood pressure regulation. Prominent bioactive phytoconstituents from citrus species include d-limonene, β-pinene, neral, citronellal, thymol, β-sitosterol, oleic acid, limonene, linalool, citral, α-pinene, coumarin, hexadecenoic acid, hesperidin, neohesperidin, eugenol, geraniol, and p-cymene, have also been reported to demonstrate anti-obesity, antidiabetics, antihypertensive, antidyslipidemic, and cardiovascular protective properties. Clinical trials support these findings, showing significant improvements in metabolic markers in human subjects following citrus-based interventions. Citrus species, due to their rich phytochemical composition, show considerable promise as natural therapeutic agents for mitigating the risks associated with metabolic syndrome. Further well-designed clinical trials are warranted to establish standardized dosages, to concentrate on their mechanisms of action, routes of administration, safe dosage, and potential side effects to ensure their efficacy and safety in treating MetSyn.","270.0"

"Content of free phenolic compounds in bananas from Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Ecuador","","The effect of Jersey milk use solely or at different inclusion rates in Holstein-Friesian milk on Cheddar cheese production was investigated. Cheese was produced every month over a year using nonstandardized milk consisting of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% Jersey milk in Holstein-Friesian milk in a 100-L vat. Actual, theoretical, and moisture-adjusted yield increased linearly with percentage of Jersey milk. This was also associated with increased fat and protein recoveries and lower yield of whey. The composition of whey was also affected by the percentage of Jersey milk, with lower whey protein and higher whey lactose and solids. Cutting time was lower when Jersey milk was used, but the cutting to milling time was higher because of slower acidity development. Hence, overall cheesemaking time was not affected by the use of Jersey milk. Using Jersey milk increased cheese fat content in autumn, winter, and spring and decreased cheese moisture in spring and summer. Cheese protein, salt, and pH levels were not affected. Cheese was analyzed for texture and color, and it was professionally graded at 3 and 8mo. The effect of Jersey on cheese sensory quality was an increase in cheese yellowness during summer and a higher total grading score at 3mo in winter; no other difference in cheese quality was found. The study indicates that using Jersey milk is a valid method of improving Cheddar cheese yield.","273.0"

"Thermal Processing Enhances the Nutritional Value of Tomatoes by Increasing Total Antioxidant Activity","11982434.0","Processed fruits and vegetables have been long considered to have lower nutritional value than their fresh commodities due to the loss of vitamin C during processing. This research group found vitamin C in apples contributed < 0.4% of total antioxidant activity, indicating most of the activity comes from the natural combination of phytochemicals. This suggests that processed fruits and vegetables may retain their antioxidant activity despite the loss of vitamin C. Here it is shown that thermal processing elevated total antioxidant activity and bioaccessible lycopene content in tomatoes and produced no significant changes in the total phenolics and total flavonoids content, although loss of vitamin C was observed. The raw tomato had 0.76 +/- 0.03 micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the vitamin C content significantly dropped to 0.68 +/- 0.02, 0.64 +/- 0.01, and 0.54 +/- 0.02 micromol of vitamin C/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). The raw tomato had 2.01 +/- 0.04 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato. After 2, 15, and 30 min of heating at 88 degrees C, the trans-lycopene content had increased to 3.11+/- 0.04, 5.45 +/- 0.02, and 5.32 +/- 0.05 mg of trans-lycopene/g of tomato (p < 0.01). The antioxidant activity of raw tomatoes was 4.13 +/- 0.36 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato. With heat treatment at 88 degrees C for 2, 15, and 30 min, the total antioxidant activity significantly increased to 5.29 +/- 0.26, 5.53 +/- 0.24, and 6.70 +/- 0.25 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of tomato, respectively (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in either total phenolics or total flavonoids. These findings indicate thermal processing enhanced the nutritional value of tomatoes by increasing the bioaccessible lycopene content and total antioxidant activity and are against the notion that processed fruits and vegetables have lower nutritional value than fresh produce. This information may have a significant impact on consumers' food selection by increasing their consumption of fruits and vegetables to reduce the risks of chronic diseases.","279.0"
"Organoleptic and nutritional evaluation of wheat breads supplemented with soybean and barley flour","","Supplementations of soy (full fat and defatted) and barley flours to wheat flours at 5, 10, 15 and 20% levels were carried out to test the effects on organoleptic and nutritional evaluation of the supplemented bread. Additions of 15% barley flour, 10% soy flour (full fat and defatted), 15% barley plus full fat soy flour and 15% barley plus defatted soy flour to wheat flour produced acceptable breads. However, substitution of soy (full fat and defatted) and barley flours to wheat flour separately and in combinations at 20% levels did not produce organoleptically acceptable bread. Various nutritional parameters, such as protein, fat, total lysine, protein digestibility (in vitro), sugars, starch digestibility (in vitro), total and available minerals, antinutrients, dietary fibre and β-glucan were determined in supplemented and control bread. Increasing the level of substitution from 5 to 10% of full fat and defatted soy flour to wheat flour significantly (P<0.05) increased protein (from 12.1 to 13.7 and 12.4 to 13.8%), lysine (from 2.74 to 3.02 and 2.76–3.05 mg/100 g protein) and total calcium (from 70.2 to 81.4 and 71.9–81.8 mg/100 g) contents. However, there was also an increase in phytic acid (238–260 and 233–253 mg/100 g), polyphenol (324–331 and 321–329 mg/100 g) and trypsin inhibitor activity (193–204 and 193–198 TIU/g). When barley flour was substituted separately, and in combinations, with full fat and defatted soy flour up to 15%, this significantly increased the contents of protein, total lysine, dietary fibre and β-glucan. It may be concluded that breads supplemented with barley and defatted soy flour, up to a 15% level, are organoleptically and nutritionally acceptable.","280.0"

Flavonoid concentration was monitored in UV-B-treated and untreated sprouts of three common beans (Zolfino ecotype, cv. Verdone, cv. Lingua di Fuoco) and one soybean (cv. Pacific). After acid hydrolysis of extracts, the CE-DAD method provides reproducible quantitative determinations of daidzein, glycitein, genistein, and kaempferol at ppm level in these natural matrices within a relatively short time (less than 16 min). Total flavonoid content determined by CE-DAD was 159 +/- 8, 26 +/- 2, 13 +/- 1, and 1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/g fresh weight for untreated sprouts of Pacific soybean, Verdone bean, Zolfino bean, and Lingua di Fuoco bean, respectively. UV-B treatment caused no significant quantitative effect on Pacific soybean sprouts, whereas it enhanced the total isoflavone content by 1.5, 1.8, and 3.2-fold in Verdone, Zolfino, and Lingua di Fuoco beans, respectively.

"Metabolism of phenolic compounds during loquat fruit development","11409982.0","Phenolic compounds in loquat fruit were identified as 5-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid), neochlorogenic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, 5-p-feruloylquinic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4-caffeoylquinic acid, epicatechin, o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Neochlorogenic acid was found to be dominant in the early stages of loquat fruit development. Both the concentrations and types of phenolic compounds were high in young fruit but then decreased steadily during growth. However, the concentration of chlorogenic acid increased during ripening and became predominant in ripe fruit. The large rise in chlorogenic acid concentration appears to be a characteristic of loquat fruit ripening. In all of the cultivars tested, the types of phenolic compounds were similar but the total phenolic content varied from 81.8 to 173.8 mg/100 g of fresh pulp. In the biosynthetic pathway of chlorogenic acid, the enzyme activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (CL), and hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (CQT) were high at the early stage of growth, diminished to low levels approximately 3 weeks prior to harvest, but then rose to a peak at 1 week before harvest. The changes of these enzyme activities seemed to be associated with variations in chlorogenic acid concentration during development, maturation, and ripening of loquat fruit.","290.0"

French) were analyzed for phenolics by reversed phase HPLC with diode array detection and tested for the ability to inhibit the Cu(2+)-catalyzed oxidation of human LDL. The mean concentrations of phenolics were 1840 mg/kg, 1397 mg/kg, and 441 mg/L in pitted prunes, extra large prunes with pits, and prune juice, respectively. Hydroxycinnamates, especially neochlorogenic acid, and chlorogenic acid predominated, and these compounds, as well as the prune and prune juice extracts, inhibited the oxidation of LDL. The pitted prune extract inhibited LDL oxidation by 24, 82, and 98% at 5, 10, and 20 micromolar gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The prune juice extract inhibited LDL oxidation by 3, 62, and 97% at 5, 10, and 20 micromolar GAE. These data indicate that prunes and prune juice may provide a source of dietary antioxidants.","292.0"
"Catechin is present as metabolites in human plasma after consumption of red wine","10460201.0","Flavonoids are components of fruits, vegetables and wines. An abundance of flavonoids in the diet is correlated with reduced heart disease mortality, suggesting that they act as protective nutrients. However, little is known about the absorption and metabolism of flavonoids after normal foods are consumed. This study measured the levels of one abundant flavonoid, (+)-catechin, and its metabolites in plasma after five male and four female volunteers consumed 120 mL of red wine (RW) one day and de-alcoholized red wine (DRW) on a separate day. Each wine sample contained 35 +/- 1 mg catechin (mean +/- SEM). Plasma levels of catechin and its metabolite 3'-O-methylcatechin (3'MC) were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the trimethylsilylated (TMS) derivatives. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were determined after enzymatic hydrolysis. Before RW or DRW consumption, plasma levels of catechin, 3'MC and all conjugates were <2 nmol/L. After 1 h, average levels of catechin, 3'MC and all conjugates increased to 91 +/- 14 nmol/L (RW) and 81 +/- 11 nmol/L (DRW). At 1 h, 21 +/- 1% of the metabolites were methylated and <2% of catechin and 3'MC were unconjugated. Catechin was present as both a sulfate conjugate and a conjugate containing both glucuronide and sulfate residues. 3'MC was present primarily as a glucuronide conjugate. At every time point, catechin was present almost exclusively as metabolites, and these levels were independent of ethanol. Therefore, if flavonoids are protective nutrients, the active forms are likely to be metabolites, which are far more abundant in plasma than the forms that exist in foods.","293.0"
"Trans-resveratrol concentration in wines produced in Greece","","A direct injection-HPLC method, based on existing methods, slightly modified, was used to analyse commercially available wines in the Greek market for their trans-resveratrol content. Red wine produced from French, or French and Greek cultivars were found to have relatively higher amounts of trans-resveratrol compared with those produced exclusively from native Vitis vinifera cultivars. However, the wines produced from the original Greek Vitis vinifera cultivars, Kotsifali and Mantilaria, appeared to contain important amounts of trans-resveratrol. White wines were found to have markedly lower concentrations of this stilbene in comparison with red wines.","294.0"

"The study of phenolic profiles of raw apricots and apples and their purees by HPLC for the evaluation of apricot nectars and jams authenticity","","The possibility of proving the authenticity of apricot nectars and jams has been investigated by using the phenol compound fingerprint. Phenol composition of the raw material (apricots and apples), their purees, apricot nectars and jams (with and without addition the definite shares of apple puree) prepared under laboratory conditions and commercial apricot nectars and jams has been determined by high performance liquid chromatography with the UV-Diode Array detection. In addition to large number of various phenol compounds contained in an apples, characteristic marker compounds of the dihydrochalcone group (phloretin 2'-xylosylglucoside and phloretin 2'-glucoside), could be determined. By using the mentioned compounds, undeclared apple admixture in the apricot based products could be detected. The cheaper admixture of the apple puree (greater than or equal to 10%) in the apricot nectars could be proved by using phloretin 2'-glucoside and phloretin 2'-xylosyglucoside, and only by using phloretin 2'-glucoside if apple puree was added in relatively low level about 5%. The undeclared admixture of apple puree in apricot jams could be detected by both mentioned dihydrochalcones if apple puree was added in level above 20%, and only by phloretin 2'-glucoside if apple puree was added in level about 10%.","296.0"

"A High-Performance Liquid-Chromatographic Method for Chlorogenic Acid Determination in Sunflower Seeds","","Sea buckthorn (<i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> L.), a wild berry abundant in Georgia, is a rich source of bioactive compounds, including antioxidants, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds, with significant potential for applications in food, nutraceutical, and cosmetic industries. Despite its traditional uses, the physicochemical properties and valorization potential of Georgian sea buckthorn remain underexplored. This study aimed to analyze the chemical composition of sea buckthorn berries from three distinct regions of Georgia (Adjara, Samtskhe-Javakheti, and Imereti) and develop innovative, environmentally friendly extraction technologies to maximize the recovery of valuable compounds. Using advanced techniques such as ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and supercritical water extraction (SWE), alongside traditional methods like maceration and Soxhlet extraction, the study identified and quantified 18 bioactive compounds, including organic acids (malic and citric acid), phenolic acids (quinic acid), and flavonoids (e.g., gallocatechin, catechin, and isorhamnetin derivatives). The lipid fraction, predominantly composed of C18 fatty acids (57.4%-76.9%), was rich in linoleic acid (29.4%-50.0%), with extraction yields varying by method. Total phenolic content ranged from 19.90 to 34.94 mg/g dry weight, with higher levels in Samtskhe-Javakheti and Imereti samples. The highest carotenoid content (3.363 mg/g dry weight) was observed in Samtskhe-Javakheti berries. UAE with 75% ethanol optimized carotenoid (1.684 mg/g) and phenolic (8.213 mg/g) recovery, while SWE achieved 86% lipid yield and high phenolic content (92.25 mg/g) in just 7 min. Carotenoid-enriched sunflower oil exhibited 3.5-fold higher antioxidant activity than control oil, demonstrating enhanced oxidative stability. The study highlights the efficacy of green extraction methods in valorizing sea buckthorn by-products, offering sustainable solutions for producing high-value nutraceuticals and functional foods. These findings underscore the potential of Georgian sea buckthorn as a source of natural antioxidants and lipids, with applications in health-promoting products.","298.0"
"Phenolic composition of the cotyledon and the seed coat of lentils (Lens culinaris L.)","","Pulses are grown worldwide and provide agronomic benefits that contribute to the sustainability of cropping systems. Pulses are high in protein and provide a good source of carbohydrates, dietary fibre, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive constituents. Crops such as lupins, chickpeas, faba beans, field peas, lentils, and mung beans, and the diversity of varieties among them, provide enormous opportunities for processing protein ingredients for use in new and existing food formulations. This review highlights the nutritional properties of pulses, protein quality, functionality, and applications for pulse protein ingredients. Understanding the functionality of pulse proteins, and the unique properties between different pulses in terms of solubility, water- and oil-holding capacity, emulsification, gelation, and foaming properties, will help maximise their use in plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, beverages, bakery products, noodles, pasta, and nutritional supplements. In this review, researchers, food technologists, and food manufacturers are provided with a comprehensive resource on pulses, and the diverse applications for pulse protein ingredients within the context of food manufacturing and the constantly evolving food technology landscape.","299.0"
"Proanthocyanidin composition in the seed coat of lentils (Lens culinaris L.)","14690386.0","Lentils (Lens culinaris L.) are a popular food in many countries. However, little is known about their phenolic composition. Because polyphenols in lentils are located essentially in their seed coat, the objective of this work was to study the composition of proanthocyanidins, the major group of polyphenols, in this part of the tissue. The use of C(18) Sep-Pak cartridges permitted the fractionation of lentil seed coat extract into monomer, oligomer, and polymer proanthocyanidin fractions. Subsequent thiolysis of oligomer and polymer fractions followed by HPLC analysis allowed the mean degree of polymerization (mDP) and the structural composition of proanthocyanidins to be determined. A fractionation of lentil seed coat extracts on a polyamide column followed by HPLC and HPLC-DAD-MS analyses was used to identify the individual proanthocyanidins. The results showed that the major monomeric flavan-3-ol was (+) catechin-3-glucose, with lesser amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin. In the oligomer fraction, various dimer, trimer, and tetramer proanthocyanidins constituted of catechin, gallocatechin, and catechin gallate units were identified, and several procyanidins and prodelphinidins from pentamers to nonamers constitute the polymer fraction. The most abundant proanthocyanidins in the seed coat of lentils are the polymers (65-75%), with a mDP of 7-9, followed by the oligomers (20-30%), with a mDP of 4-5.","300.0"

"Changes in the content of bioactive polyphenolic compounds of lentils by the action of exogenous enzymes. Effect on their antioxidant activity","","The study of the effect of the enzymes tannase, α-galactosidase, phytase and viscozyme on the phenolic composition of lentil flours, in a semi pilot scale stirred fermentor, shows that important modifications occur. Among them, hydroxycinnamic compounds and proanthocyanidins are significantly decreased after the enzymatic treatments. However, quercetin 3-O rutinoside and luteolin increase and reach the highest concentration with tannase. The formation of trans-resveratrol was observed by the action of tannase and phytase, and gallic acid by the action of phytase, α-galactosidase and tannase. The antioxidant capacity of the methanolic extracts was determined by their free radical scavenging activity, using the DPPH test, to study the differences in the behaviour of polyphenolics compounds as antioxidants after the different enzymatic treatments. The treatments with viscozyme, α-galactosidase or tannase produce an increase in the antioxidant activity when compared to raw lentils. The results of the analysis of principal components to examine the relationship among antioxidant activity (EC50) (DPPH test) and the concentrations of polyphenolics in all lentils samples, show that the quercetin 3-O rutinoside appears to be the compound with the greatest influence on the EC50 values.","302.0"

Fifteen were identified, two were tentatively identified, and only the aglycon of the remaining two components was certainly identified. Six anthocyanin-derived pigments, supposedly formed during wine maturation, were also investigated and found in a wine sample. The analysis of red wine anthocyanins was also carried out by injecting a large sample volume onto a 0.32 mm ID HPLC column, using the column focusing technique, in order to decrease the limit of detection and quantification of components present in a very small amounts.","303.0"
"Optimum domestic processing and cooking methods for reducing polyphenolic (antinutrient) content of pigeon peas","10768410.0","Four high yielding and early maturing cultivars of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) namely UPAS-120, ICPL-87, ICPL-151 and, especially, Manak, contained significant amounts of polyphenols (1075 to 1328 mg/100g), which may limit their utilization. The effectiveness of soaking (6, 12 and 18 h, 30 degrees C), soaking and dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and germination (24, 36, 48 h, 30 degrees C) in reducing the levels of polyphenols was investigated. A decrease in the polyphenolic contents varying from 4 to 26 percent in different pigeon pea cultivar was achieved. Pressure cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds was found to be the most effective method, followed by sprouting for 48 h, ordinary cooking of soaked-dehulled seeds, and pressure cooking of soaked whole seeds followed by sprouting for 36 h.","304.0"
"Effect of variety, processing, and storage on the flavonoid glycoside content and composition of lettuce and endive","10995297.0","Eight varieties of lettuce (Lactuca sativum) and three varieties of endive (Cichorium endivia) were analyzed for flavonoid composition and content. Total flavonoid contents, expressed as units of aglycon for fresh material, were in the ranges of 0.3-229 microg/g for lettuce and 44-248 microg/g for endive. Five quercetin conjugates [quercetin 3-O-galactoside, quercetin 3-O-glucoside, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, quercetin 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside, and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside] and luteolin 7-O-glucuronide were measured in the green-leafed lettuce and an additional two cyanidin conjugates [cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-[(6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] in the red-leafed varieties. Three kaempferol conjugates [kaempferol 3-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-glucuronide, and kaempferol 3-O-[6-O-malonyl)glucoside]] were measured in each of the endive varieties. The presence and identity of kaempferol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl)glucoside in endive was shown for the first time. Shredding of lettuce leaf followed by exposure to light produced significant losses of the flavonoid moiety in the green oak leaf (94%), red oak leaf (43%), iceberg (36%), green batavia (25%), lollo biondo (24%), and lollo rosso (6%) samples, whereas cos and green salad bowl samples did not show an overall loss. Shredding of endive also produced loss of the flavonoid moiety in escarole (32%), fine frisee (13%), and coarse frisee (8%). Significant demalonation was observed for both the quercetin and cyanidin glucosides in lettuce, whereas a similar degradation of the kaempferol analogue was found in endive tissue. Storage of whole heads of both lettuce and endive in the dark at 1 degrees C and 98% humidity for 7 days resulted in losses of total flavonol glycosides in the range of 7-46%. The identification of the amounts, position of substitution, and nature of the sugars is important for understanding the potential bioavailability and biological activities of flavonoids in salads.","305.0"
"Polyphenols from alcoholic apple cider are absorbed, metabolized and excreted by humans","11823574.0","We determined the uptake and excretion of low doses of polyphenols in six subjects who each consumed 1.1 L of an alcoholic cider beverage. Over a 24-h period, no phloretin was detected in plasma (detection limit = 0.036 micromol/L), but 21 +/- 5% of the dose (4.8 mg) was excreted in the urine. In contrast, from a low dose of 1.6-mg quercetin equivalents, no quercetin was found in urine or plasma, but 3'-methyl quercetin was detected in plasma [C(max) (maximum concentration) = 0.14 +/- 0.19 micromol/L; range: 0 to 0.44 micromol/L]. No flavanol monomers (dose of free (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin = 3.5 mg) were detected in urine or plasma (detection limit: 0.01 micromol/L). Caffeic acid (total dose including esters = 11 mg) was detected only in plasma within 2 h, with C(max) = 0.43 +/- 0.3 micromol/L (range: 0.18 to 0.84 micromol/L). An almost 3-fold increase in hippuric acid was detected in 24-h urine (74 +/- 29 micromol/L; range: 38-116 micromol/L), compared with a prestudy value of 19 +/- 9 micromol/L. These data show that polyphenols are taken up from cider, that phloretin is excreted in the urine and suggest that low doses of quercetin are extensively methylated in humans.","306.0"

"Oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and phenolic and anthocyanin concentrations in fruit and leaf tissues of highbush blueberry","11368580.0","Antioxidant capacity, as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and total phenolic and total anthocyanin contents were evaluated in fruit tissues of 87 highbush blueberry (Vacciniumcorymbosum L.) and species-introgressed highbush blueberry cultivars. ORAC and phenolic levels were evaluated in leaf tissues of the same materials. Average values for ORAC, phenolics, and anthocyanins in fruit were 15.9 ORAC units, 1.79 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), and 0.95 mg/g (cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalents), respectively. Cv. Rubel had the highest ORAC per gram of fresh weight values, at 31.1 units, and cv. Elliott had the highest values on the basis of ORAC per square centimeter of surface area. In leaf tissue, values for both ORAC and phenolics were significantly higher than in fruit tissue, with mean values of 490 ORAC units and 44.80 mg/g (gallic acid equivalents), respectively. Leaf ORAC had a low, but significant, correlation with fruit phenolics and anthocyanins, but not with fruit ORAC. An analysis of ORAC values versus calculated midparent values in 11 plants from the 87-cultivar group in which all parents were tested suggested that, across cultivars, ORAC inheritance is additive. An investigation of ORAC values in a family of 44 cv. Rubel x Duke seedlings showed negative epistasis for ORAC values, suggesting Rubel may have gene combinations contributing to ORAC that are broken up during hybridization.","308.0"
"The differential tissue distribution of the citrus flavanone naringenin following gastric instillation","15763957.0","Citrus flavonoids have been investigated for their biological activity, with both anti-inflammatory and -carcinogenic effects being reported. However, little information is known on the bioavailability of these compounds in vivo. The objectives of this study were to determine the tissue distribution of naringenin after gastric gavage of [3H]-naringenin to rats. Unlabelled naringenin was also used to quantify the levels of naringenin and its major metabolites in tissues and eliminated in the urine and faeces. Significant radioactivity was detected in the plasma as well as all tissues examined 2h post-gavage. After 18h, higher levels of radioactivity were retained in plasma and tissues (55% of the administered radioactivity). Investigation of the nature of metabolites, using unlabelled naringenin, revealed that the glucuronides were the major components in plasma, tissues and urine, in addition to the colonic metabolite 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, detected in the urine. The aglycone was the form extensively retained in tissues after 18h post-gavage. Total identified metabolites detected after 18h in most tissues were only 1-5% of the levels detected after 2h. However, the brain, lungs and heart retained 27, 20 and 11%, respectively, relative to the total metabolites detected at 2h. While radioactive detection suggests increased levels of breakdown products of naringenin after 18 h versus 2 h, the products identified using unlabelled naringenin are not consistent with this, suggesting that a predominant proportion of the naringenin breakdown products at 18 h are retained as smaller decomposition molecules which cannot yet be identified.","309.0"
"Absorption, tissue distribution and excretion of pelargonidin and its metabolites following oral administration to rats","16441916.0","Recent reports have demonstrated various cardiovascular and neurological benefits associated with the consumption of foods rich in anthocyanidins. However, information regarding absorption, metabolism, and especially, tissue distribution are only beginning to accumulate. In the present study, we investigated the occurrence and the kinetics of various circulating pelargonidin metabolites, and we aimed at providing initial information with regard to tissue distribution. Based on HPLC and LC-MS analyses we demonstrate that pelargonidin is absorbed and present in plasma following oral gavage to rats. In addition, the main structurally related pelargonidin metabolite identified in plasma and urine was pelargonidin glucuronide. Furthermore, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, a ring fission product of pelargonidin, was detected in plasma and urine samples obtained at 2 and 18 h after ingestion. At 2 h post-gavage, pelargonidin glucuronide was the major metabolite detected in kidney and liver, with levels reaching 0.5 and 0.15 nmol pelargonidin equivalents/g tissue, respectively. Brain and lung tissues contained detectable levels of the aglycone, with the glucuronide also present in the lungs. Other tissues, including spleen and heart, did not contain detectable levels of pelargonidin or ensuing metabolites. At 18 h post-gavage, tissue analyses did not reveal detectable levels of the aglycone nor of pelargonidin glucuronides. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the overall uptake of the administered pelargonidin was 18 % after 2 h, with the majority of the detected levels located in the stomach. However, the amounts recovered dropped to 1.2 % only 18 h post-gavage, with the urine and faecal content constituting almost 90 % of the total recovered pelargonidin.","310.0"
"Nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) undergoing different cooking methods and germination","11855623.0","The effects of cooking treatments (boiling, autoclaving and microwave cooking) and germination on the nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas were studied. Cooking treatments and/or germination caused significant (p < 0.05) decreases in fat, total ash, carbohydrate fractions, antinutritional factors, minerals and B-vitamins. Germination was less effective than cooking treatments in reducing trypsin inhibitor, hemagglutinin activity, tannins and saponins; it was more effective in reducing phytic acid, stachyose and raffinose. Cooking treatments and germination decreased the concentrations of lysine, tryptophan, total aromatic and sulfur-containing amino acids. However, cooked and germinated chickpeas were still higher in lysine, isoleucine and total aromatic amino acid contents than the FAO/WHO reference. The losses in B-vitamins and minerals in chickpeas cooked by microwaving were smaller than in those cooked by boiling and autoclaving. Germination resulted in greater retention of all minerals and B-vitamins compared to cooking treatments. In vitro protein digestibility, protein efficiency ratio and essential amino acid index were improved by all treatments. The chemical score and limiting amino acid of chickpeas subjected to the various treatments varied considerably, depending on the type of treatment. Based on these results, microwave cooking appears to be the best alternative for legume preparation in households and restaurants.","311.0"

"Antioxidant activity and phenolic contents of oat groats and hulls","","Research was initiated to measure antioxidant activity of extracts from oat (Avena sativa L.) groats and hulls and the concentrations of phenolic substances that may contribute to antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts of four cultivars was evaluated by an in vitro assay that measures the inhibition of coupled autoxidation of linoleic acid and beta-carotene. Total phenolic content was determined using Folin and Ciocalteau's phenol reagent and was expressed as gallic acid equivalents. Phenolic compounds were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and detected at 290 nm. Peaks were identified by comparing retention times and spectra with known standards and verified with internal standards. Groats had significantly higher antioxidant activity than hulls. For two cultivars, total phenolic content was similar in groats and hulls, whereas one cultivar had higher and another lower total phenolic content in groats than hulls. Ten phenolic compounds were separated and identified in extracts, and one flavan-3-ol and three avenanthramides were tentatively identified.

Pearling fractions were also highest in total phenolics and tocols. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, and ferulic acid were identified and quantified by HPLC. Three avenanthramides and an unidentified ferulate derivative were also detected. Total phenolic content was significantly correlated with antioxidant activity, and regression equations that predicted antioxidant activity from phenolic and tocol concentrations were calculated. Antioxidant activity, evaluated by beta-carotene bleaching, was correlated with measures of oxygen radical absorbance capacity and low-density lipoprotein oxidation.

"Evaluation of high-performance liquid chromatography for determination of phenolic compounds in pear horticultural cultivars","","The taste, aroma, and sensory characteristics of cherries are key factors influencing consumer acceptance. In this study, the sensory evaluation, biochemical characteristics, and their relationships with consumer satisfaction of several representative cherry cultivars were analyzed during cold storage to establish systematic quality evaluation parameters. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant differences in physiological quality and metabolic profiles among the tested cultivars. Specifically, 'Benitemari' demonstrated more contents of soluble solids and titratable acid, while 'Tieton' and 'Skeena' showed higher concentrations of volatile organic compounds and polyphenolics. Furthermore, hexanal and (E)-2-hexenal were identified as the dominant VOCs, while cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside was confirmed as a major phenolic component across the cultivars. Finally, the comprehensive score of the principal component model was significantly positively correlated with the scores of firmness, chewiness, sweetness, sourness, and taste and bitterness in the sensory evaluation. The results were expected to provide valuable guidance for standardizing the sweet cherry supply chain and cultivating high-quality sweet cherry cultivars.","317.0"

Advanced chromatographic techniques, such as LC-MS/MS and GC-MS, enable trace-level quantification of acrylamide and serve as essential tools for validating the efficacy of mitigation strategies, including enzymatic, fermentation-based, and antioxidant treatments. Additionally, emerging biotechnological approaches, including engineered enzymes, probiotic detoxification, and nanostructured hydrocolloid systems, are discussed for their potential to minimize acrylamide while preserving sensory attributes. Limitations in current methodologies, including variability across food matrices and scalability challenges, are critically assessed. This study highlights recent progress in chromatographic methods for acrylamide detection and explores mitigation strategies to reduce its levels in heat-treated foods, emphasizing the importance of continued research in food safety.","318.0"
"Approach to the content of total extractable phenolic compounds from different food samples by comparison of chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods","","Large-fruited cranberry (<i>Vaccinium macrocarpon</i> Ait.) is a rich source of polyphenolic compounds, including anthocyanins, flavonols, and unique A-type proanthocyanidins, which exhibit strong antioxidant and health-promoting properties. Cranberry pomace, a by-product generated during juice and concentrate production, remains underutilized despite being abundant in dietary fiber and non-extractable polyphenols (NEPPs). In this study, cranberry pomace was characterized phytochemically and applied as a functional ingredient in biscuits at levels of 5%, 10%, and 15% substitution of wheat flour. Total polyphenol content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (ABTS<sup>•+</sup>, DPPH<sup>•</sup>) were significantly higher in pomace compared to whole fruit values reported in the literature, which can be attributed to the concentration of polymeric proanthocyanidins and flavonols in skins and seeds. Biscuits enriched with pomace exhibited a dose-dependent increase in TPC and antioxidant capacity, with the 15% variant showing up to 6-fold higher polyphenol content and over 30-fold higher ABTS<sup>•+</sup> activity after in vitro digestion compared to control. Digestion also released NEPP bound to the fiber matrix, improving bioaccessibility. Moreover, extracts from digested biscuits reduced oxidative stress in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and inhibited COX-1, COX-2, and AChE activities, suggesting potential anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. These findings highlight cranberry pomace as a sustainable, high-value ingredient for functional foods, aligning with circular economy strategies.","319.0"
"Iberian pig as a model to clarify obscure points in the bioavailability and metabolism of ellagitannins in humans","17990850.0","Ellagitannin-containing foods (strawberries, walnuts, pomegranate, raspberries, oak-aged wine, etc.) have attracted attention due to their cancer chemopreventive, cardioprotective, and antioxidant effects. Ellagitannins (ETs) are not absorbed as such but are metabolized by the intestinal flora to yield urolithins (hydroxydibenzopyran-6-one derivatives). In this study, Iberian pig is used as a model to clarify human ET metabolism. Pigs were fed either cereal fodder or acorns, a rich source of ETs. Plasma, urine, bile, lumen and intestinal tissues (jejunum and colon), feces, liver, kidney, heart, brain, lung, muscle, and subcutaneous fat tissue were analyzed. The results demonstrate that acorn ETs release ellagic acid (EA) in the jejunum, then the intestinal flora metabolizes EA sequentially to yield tetrahydroxy- (urolithin D), trihydroxy- (urolithin C), dihydroxy- (urolithin A), and monohydroxy- (urolithin B) dibenzopyran-6-one metabolites, which were absorbed preferentially when their lipophilicity increased. Thirty-one ET-derived metabolites were detected, including 25 urolithin and 6 EA derivatives. Twenty-six extensively conjugated metabolites were detected in bile, glucuronides and methyl glucuronides of EA and particularly urolithin A, C, and D derivatives, confirming a very active enterohepatic circulation. Urolithins A and B as well as dimethyl-EA-glucuronide were detected in peripheral plasma. The presence of EA metabolites in bile and in urine and its absence in intestinal tissues suggested its absorption in the stomach. Urolithin A was the only metabolite detected in feces and together with its glucuronide was the most abundant metabolite in urine. No metabolites accumulated in any organ analyzed. The whole metabolism of ETs is shown for the first time, confirming previous studies in humans and explaining the long persistency of urolithin metabolites in the body mediated by an active enterohepatic circulation.","320.0"
"Polyphenols in wild and weedy Mexican common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)","16756378.0","The polyphenolic composition of 62 wild and weedy Mexican bean collections from diverse origins, grouped by their seed coat color, was assessed. According to spectrophotometric analysis, the range of total phenols, condensed tannins, and total anthocyanins presented wide differences. Furthermore, the phenolic acid, flavonoid, and anthocyanin profiles were analyzed using HPLC. Ferulic was the main phenolic acid. Kaempferol and quercetin were the main flavonoids, and the isoflavones daidzein and coumestrol were found in only low levels in few collections. Delphinidin was the main anthocyanidin found, followed by petunidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, and peonidin. The wide variation observed in polyphenolic contents was more related to their genotype than to the color factor. These results show that some wild and weedy beans are good sources of phenolic compounds for use in breeding programs focused on nutrition and health.","321.0"
"Physicochemical and sensory fruit characteristics of two sweet cherry cultivars after cool storage","","Physicochemical and sensory fruit characteristics were studied to assess the effects of cool storage on quality attributes of sweet cherries of the Sciazza variety, widespread in the Campania region and Ferrovia variety, marketed in Italy and abroad. The major sugar and organic acid constituents, anthocyanin composition, colour (CIE L*, a*, b*), firmness, volatile neo-formation compounds (acetaldehyde, ethanol and methanol) and sensory attributes were determined at harvest and after 15 days of fruit storage at 1 °C and 95% RH. The ANOVA and PCA plots showed that both cherry varieties and storage conditions affected sensory/chemical quality but the variation caused by cool storage seemed to be dependent on the varieties under study: Ferrovia cherries apparently varied less than Sciazza. The total anthocyanin and its qualitative composition were confirmed to be distinctive of the cherry varieties and important indicators of cool storage.","322.0"
"Variability in the alkylresorcinol content of rye grain","","Alkylresorcinols (ARs) are bioactive phenolic lipids with potential health-promoting properties; they are particularly abundant in wheat bran. This study aimed to compare the efficiency of eight extraction methods-including Soxhlet, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and overnight solvent-assisted maceration (OSAM) protocols-used in the removal of ARs from wheat bran, and to evaluate the association between AR composition and antiproliferative activity. A metabolite profiling approach using HPLC-DAD-MS identified 12 AR homologs differing in side-chain length and functional groups. Among the extraction strategies, the UA extraction, OSAM and Soxhlet-assisted with only acetone yielded the highest concentrations of bioactive ARs, particularly the C<sub>17</sub>-C<sub>25</sub> homologs characteristic of cereals. Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) determined the discrimination of the different extraction methods, while variable importance scores revealed that AR homologs such as C<sub>25</sub>, C<sub>19:1</sub>, and C<sub>23:Oxo</sub> were key to the distinguishment of the extraction methods. Antiproliferative assays against PC-3 prostate cancer cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 13.3-55.6 µg/mL) demonstrated that extracts rich in oxygenated ARs exhibited significantly higher antiproliferative effects than those dominated by saturated compounds. This finding suggests that both side-chain length and functionalization (e.g., keto groups) influence AR bioactivity. These findings suggest that extraction conditions can be optimized not only to enhance AR yield but also to enrich homologs with higher antiproliferative potential, providing foundations for exploring AR-enriched products derived from wheat bran.","323.0"

"Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tatricum Gaertn.) as a source of dietary rutin and quercitrin","14558761.0","Two samples of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.) from China and one from Luxembourg were studied by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to reveal the possibilities of growing tartary buckwheat herb as a possible source of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin. The content of rutin was determined as up to 3% dry weight (DW) in tartary buckwheat herb. Quercitrin values were in the range of 0.01-0.05% DW. Only traces of quercetin were detected in just some of the samples. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained more rutin (about 0.8-1.7% DW) than common buckwheat seeds (0.01% DW). Rutin and quercetin content in seeds depends on variety and growing conditions. Tartary buckwheat seeds contained traces of quercitrin and quercetin, which were not found in common buckwheat seeds.","325.0"
"The antioxidant capacity and polyphenol content of organic and conventional retail vegetables after domestic cooking","","Vegetable consumption is associated with health benefits. Organic foods are thought to have higher contents of antioxidant substances. The objective of this work is to quantify soluble and hydrolyzable polyphenols, ascorbic acid, and the antioxidant capacity of fresh conventional and organic retail vegetables (potato, carrot, onion, broccoli, and white cabbage) while evaluating the effect of boiling, microwaving, and steaming on these parameters. The recovery rate for soluble and hydrolyzable polyphenols was variable according to the vegetable analyzed. However, soluble polyphenols resulted in lower recovery rates than did hydrolyzable phenolics after cooking. Organic vegetables showed higher sensitivity to heat processing than did conventionally grown vegetables. In general, cooking was found to lead to reductions in the antioxidant capacity for most vegetables, with small differences between the cooking methods applied. Even with the alterations in their content, polyphenols showed a positive correlation with antioxidant capacity in raw and cooked vegetables from both types of agriculture.","326.0"
"Antioxidant properties of raw and cooked spears of green asparagus cultivars","","This study was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant properties, including phenolics, ascorbic acid and carotenoids of four green asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) spears cultivars (UC 157, AM 822, Gijnlim, and Grande) grown under greenhouse conditions and to asses their changes during cooking process. The highest spear production of category 'extra' and 'first' was recorded on 'UC 157', whereas the higher production of ""second"" class spears was recorded on 'UC 157' and 'Gijnlim'. The Grande cultivar has provided a higher total phenol, quercetin, rutin and lutein + zeaxantin contents in comparison to 'UC 157', 'Gjinlim' and 'AM 822' cultivars. The results also indicate that the effect of cooking process was significant and more pronounced than the effect of cultivars. The cooking process increased the antioxidant activity, total phenols, quercetin, rutin, β-carotene and lutein + zeaxantin contents by, 16%, 23%, 98%, 32%, 24% and 25%, respectively, but decreased the total ascorbic acid content by 52%.","327.0"
"Characterization of isoflavones and their conjugates in female rat urine using LC/MS/MS","11958644.0","Isoflavone phytoestrogens found in soybeans are the most widely studied phytochemicals in human diets and soy infant formulas. The health benefits of the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have been reported, and concerns about potential adverse effects have also been raised. However, the results of direct analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in biological fluids after consumption of soy-containing diets are scarce. This study describes an LC/MS/MS method for the analysis of isoflavones and their metabolites in the urine of female rats fed diets made with soy protein isolate. Five isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, dihydrodaidzein, and O-desmethylangolensin) were identified by comparison with authentic standards. Seventeen conjugates of isoflavones were characterized in the urine, the most unusual being genistein 5-glucuronide and four glucuronide conjugates of reductive metabolites of daidzein. The application of LC/MS/MS to analyze isoflavone metabolites is simple and sensitive, and appears to be an excellent method for determining the bioavailability and metabolism of food phytochemistry.","328.0"
"A rapid LC/MS/MS quantitation assay for naringin and its two metabolites in rats plasma","16406442.0","Naringin is a flavonoid that exists in many plants and traditional Chinese medicines. In this study, a highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed for quantification of naringin and its two metabolites, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide. Naringin and naringenin were extracted from rat plasma with ethyl acetate, using hesperidin as an internal standard. Components in the extract were separated on a 100 mm x 2.0 mm Betabasic 5 microm C18 ODS column by isocratic elution with 70% methanol. The components were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode in the precursor/product ion pair of m/z 581.3/273.4 for naringin, m/z 273.4/153.1 for naringenin and m/z 611.5/303.4 for hesperidin, respectively. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the range of 5-1000 ng/ml, using 0.1 ml rat plasma. The within-day coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.1, 1.8 and 2.2% for naringin, 3.0, 3.3, 3.1% for naringenin at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml (n=5). The between-day CVs were 3.4, 1.7 and 4.9% for naringin and 4.0, 3.0, 4.6% for naringenin (n=5) at 5, 50 and 500 ng/ml respectively. A formulation based on PEG400 was used and orally administered to Sprague-Dawley male rats. Plasma drug concentrations were measured by this method and the pharmacokinetics was analyzed by WinNonlin computer software. Plasma concentration-time profiles of naringin were found to increase quickly and decline rapidly within 2 h and could not be detected after 24 h. Naringenin and naringenin glucuronide occurred slower and the T(max) were about 9 and 7.5 h later, respectively.","329.0"
"In vitro antioxidant capacity from wort to beer","","This study examined the profile of bioactive peptides and polysaccharides in beer wort enriched with malted and unmalted hemp seeds. The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of different hemp processing methods (malted versus unmalted) on the concentration and characteristics of bioactive compounds-specifically (1) peptides exhibiting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive activities and (2) soluble polysaccharide fractions that affect wort viscosity and prebiotic potential. The results indicated that supplementation with 10% malted hemp seeds was most favorable. This level of addition enhanced the peptide composition of the wort without adversely affecting fermentation efficiency. Moreover, it facilitated the generation of functional peptides with antioxidant and flavor-enhancing properties and introduced non-fermentable polysaccharides that improved wort viscosity and foam stability without the negative effects observed at higher hemp seed concentrations. In contrast, a 30% addition of hemp seeds, particularly in unmalted form, led to a reduction in fermentable sugar and peptide contents and increased the likelihood of fermentation slowdown. The incorporation of 10% malted hemp seeds has the potential to enhance the sensory and functional attributes of beer, primarily due to the presence of bioactive peptides and polysaccharides, while maintaining fermentation performance and clarity. Fermentation and brewing efficiency may decline at higher hemp seed inclusion rates, warranting further investigation. The use of unmalted hemp necessitates enzymatic treatment to improve fermentable sugar availability. Additionally, high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) proved to be a valuable analytical tool for optimizing wort composition in the development of hemp-enriched beers.","330.0"
"Effect of roasting on the formation of chlorogenic acid lactones in coffee","15740032.0","Of all plant constituents, coffee has one of the highest concentrations of chlorogenic acids. When roasting coffee, some of these are transformed into chlorogenic acid lactones (CGL). We have studied the formation of CGL during the roasting of coffee beans in Coffea arabica cv. Bourbon; C. arabicacv. Longberry; and C. canephora cv. Robusta. Individual CGL levels were determined by comparison of HPLC peaks with those of synthetic CGL standards. Seven CGL were identified: 3-caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-CQL), 4- caffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-CQL), 3-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-pCoQL), 4-coumaroylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-pCoQL), 3-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (3-FQL), 4-feruloylquinic-1,5-lactone (4-FQL), and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic-1,5-lactone (3,4-diCQL). 3-CQL was the most abundant lactone in C. arabica and C. canephora, reaching peak values of 230 +/- 9 and 254 +/- 4 mg/100 g (dry weight), respectively, at light medium roast ( approximately 14% weight loss). 4-CQL was the second most abundant lactone (116 +/- 3 and 139 +/- 2 mg/100 g, respectively. The maximum amount of CGL represents approximately 30% of the available precursors. The relative levels of 3-CQL and 4-CQL in roasted coffee were reverse to those of their precursors in green coffee. This suggests that roasting causes isomerization of chlorogenic acids prior to the formation of lactones and that the levels of lactones in roasted coffee do not reflect the levels of precursors in green coffee.","331.0"
"Chlorogenic acids and lactones in regular and water-decaffeinated arabica coffees","16417293.0","The market for decaffeinated coffees has been increasingly expanding over the years. Caffeine extraction may result in losses of other compounds such as chlorogenic acids (CGA) and, consequently, their 1,5-gamma-quinolactones (CGL) in roasted coffee. These phenolic compounds are important for flavor formation as well as the health effects of coffee; therefore, losses due to decaffeination need to be investigated. The present study evaluates the impact of decaffeination processing on CGA and CGL levels of green and roasted arabica coffees. Decaffeination produced a 16% average increase in the levels of total CGA in green coffee (dry matter), along with a 237% increase in CGL direct precursors. Different degrees of roasting showed average increments of 5.5-18% in CGL levels of decaffeinated coffee, compared to regular, a change more consistent with observed levels of total CGA than with those of CGL direct precursors in green samples. On the other hand, CGA levels in roasted coffee were 3-9% lower in decaffeinated coffee compared to regular coffee. Although differences in CGA and CGL contents of regular and decaffeinated roasted coffees appear to be relatively small, they may be enough to affect flavor characteristics as well as the biopharmacological properties of the final beverage, suggesting the need for further study.","332.0"
"A liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QTOF)-based metabolomic approach reveals new metabolic effects of catechin in rats fed high-fat diets","18484765.0","Unbalanced diets generate oxidative stress commonly associated with the development of diabetes, atherosclerosis, obesity and cancer. Dietary flavonoids have antioxidant properties and may limit this stress and reduce the risk of these diseases. We used a metabolomic approach to study the influence of catechin, a common flavonoid naturally occurring in various fruits, wine or chocolate, on the metabolic changes induced by hyperlipidemic diets. Male Wistar rats ( n = 8/group) were fed during 6 weeks normolipidemic (5% w/w) or hyperlipidemic (15 and 25%) diets with or without catechin supplementation (0.2% w/w). Urines were collected at days 17 and 38 and analyzed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF). Hyperlipidic diets led to a significant increase of oxidative stress in liver and aorta, upon which catechin had no effect. Multivariate analyses (PCA and PLS-DA) of the urine fingerprints allowed discrimination of the different diets. Variables were then classified according to their dependence on lipid and catechin intake (ANOVA). Nine variables were identified as catechin metabolites of tissular or microbial origin. Around 1000 variables were significantly affected by the lipid content of the diet, and 76 were fully reversed by catechin supplementation. Four variables showing an increase in urinary excretion in rats fed the high-fat diets were identified as deoxycytidine, nicotinic acid, dihydroxyquinoline and pipecolinic acid. After catechin supplementation, the excretion of nicotinic acid was fully restored to the level found in the rats fed the low-fat diet. The physiological significance of these metabolic changes is discussed.","333.0"
"Metabolomics provide new insight on the metabolism of dietary phytochemicals in rats","18567748.0","Foods of plant origin contain a large number of phytochemicals that may positively affect health. Phytochemicals are largely excreted in urine as metabolites that are formed in host tissues or by the microbiota and constitute a great proportion of the urinary metabolome. The latter can be characterized by a metabolomics approach. In this work, we compared the metabolism of lignins to that of the structurally related ferulic acid (FA) and sinapic acid (SA). Five groups of rats (n = 5) were fed for 2 d a purified diet alone [control (C)] or supplemented with lignin-enriched wheat bran (3% of the diet, wt:wt), poplar wood lignins (0.42%), FA (0.42%), or SA (0.42%). The metabolomes of urine samples collected after 1 and 2 d of supplementation were analyzed by high-resolution MS (liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight). Comparing metabolic fingerprints by gathering semiquantitative information on several hundreds of metabolites and using multivariate statistical analysis (partial least squares for discriminant analysis) showed the similarity between both lignin-supplemented and C groups and confirmed that lignins are largely inert and not absorbed in the body. One the other hand, metabolic fingerprints of the 2 phenolic acid-supplemented groups were clearly distinct from the C group. Differences between the groups were mainly from nonmetabolized FA and SA and metabolites excreted in urine. Thirteen of them were identified as sulfate esters and glucuronide and glycine conjugates of the same phenolic acids, and of dihydrosinapic, vanillic, and benzoic acids. This study shows that metabolomics allows the identification of new metabolites of phytochemicals and can be used to distinguish individuals fed different phytochemical-containing foods.","334.0"
"Effects of toasting on the carbohydrate profile and antioxidant properties of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) flour added to durum wheat pasta","","The effects of the toasting process on the carbohydrate profile and antioxidant properties of chickpea flour were studied, along with the cooking behaviour, and antioxidant and nutritional properties of pasta enriched with the chickpea flour. The toasting process increased the resistant starch, insoluble dietary fibre and antioxidant properties of the flour. Addition of chickpea flour (raw and toasted) to durum wheat semolina changed the carbohydrate profile in the uncooked and cooked enriched pasta, especially with the toasted chickpea, and worsened the overall quality of the pasta. The increase in total phenolic content and total free phenolic acid content in the uncooked pasta was due to positive effects of addition of the chickpea flours, while the increase in the bound phenolics fraction in the cooked pasta was from the durum wheat, which was crucial for its high concentrations of ferulic acid. The increase in the free fraction of the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity in cooked pasta was consistent with the addition of chickpea.","335.0"
"Strawberry anthocyanins are recovered in urine as glucuro- and sulfoconjugates in humans","12730413.0","Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds widely distributed in fruits and vegetables. Their consumption has been shown to prevent some chronic diseases. Anthocyanin metabolism, however, is still not fully understood. The aim of this work was to evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins in humans consuming a meal containing strawberries and to identify possible metabolites in urine. Six healthy volunteers (three women and three men) consumed a meal containing 200 g strawberries (providing 179 micro mol pelargonidin-3-glucoside). Urine samples were collected before and after the meal and rapidly treated by solid-phase extraction. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites were carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC with UV-visible detection, respectively. In addition to pelargonidin-3-glucoside, five anthocyanin metabolites were identified in urine: three monoglucuronides of pelargonidin, one sulfoconjugate of pelargonidin and pelargonidin itself. Total urinary excretion of strawberry anthocyanin metabolites corresponded to 1.80 +/- 0.29% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of pelargonidin-3-glucoside ingested. More than 80% of this excretion was related to a monoglucuronide. Four hours after the meal, more than two-thirds of anthocyanin metabolites had been excreted, although urinary excretion of the metabolites continued until the end of the 24-h experiment.

"Absorption and metabolism of red orange juice anthocyanins in rats","16611379.0","Anthocyanins are natural pigments that could be involved in various health effects. Red oranges are an important dietary source of anthocyanins, including cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) and an acylated derivative, cyanidin 3-(6''-malonyl)-glucoside (Cy 3-malglc). The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption and metabolism of red orange anthocyanins in rats fed an anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 d (approximately 2.8 micromol anthocyanins/d). Furthermore, the absorption of these anthocyanins was studied in both the stomach and intestine using in situ models in rats. Anthocyanin metabolites were identified and quantified by HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem MS and HPLC-diode array detection, respectively. The red orange anthocyanins, Cy 3-glc and Cy 3-malglc, as well as their respective methylated derivatives, were recovered in urine after red orange juice intake. The 24 h urinary excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.081 (SEM 0.009) % of the ingested amount). However, a high proportion (about 20 %) of red orange anthocyanins was absorbed from the stomach. More Cy 3-malglc than Cy 3-glc was absorbed in the intestine. This study thus indicated that red orange juice anthocyanins were rapidly absorbed from both stomach and small intestine, and then excreted in the urine as intact and methylated forms. Moreover, the absorption and metabolism of acylated anthocyanins and non-acylated anthocyanins were similar.","338.0"
"Influence of glucose on cyanidin 3-glucoside absorption in rats","18646002.0","Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various health effects. However their mechanisms of absorption are still not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of glucose on anthocyanin absorption in rats. We first studied anthocyanin bioavailability in rats that received by gastric intubation approximately 53 micromol cyanidin 3-glucoside (Cy 3-glc) equivalents from a red orange extract with or without 2.51 mmol glucose. Neither 24-h urinary anthocyanin excretion nor plasma anthocyanin concentration was significantly affected by simultaneous ingestion of glucose. The influence of glucose (12, 42 or 72 mM) on intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc (pure or from a red orange extract; approximately 12.3 microM) was further studied using an in situ intestinal perfusion model. Absorption of pure Cy 3-glc from the intestinal lumen was not significantly affected by the amount of glucose. However, intestinal absorption of Cy 3-glc from the red orange extract (6.49 +/- 1.44%, n = 6) was significantly less than that of pure Cy 3-glc (17.5 +/- 1.3%, n = 7) (p < 0.01) suggesting that the red orange extract contained other components that were able to interfere with Cy 3-glc intestinal absorption. This study has thus shown that glucose did not interfere with anthocyanin glucoside absorption.","339.0"
"Tissue distribution of anthocyanins in rats fed a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet","19653220.0","Anthocyanins are natural dietary pigments that could be involved in various health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of anthocyanins to various organs (bladder, prostate, testes, heart and adipose tissue) in rats fed with a blackberry anthocyanin-enriched diet for 12 days. Identification and quantification of anthocyanins were carried out by HPLC-DAD. The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins (native anthocyanins and their metabolites) was low (0.20 +/- 0.03%, n = 8). Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives (methylated anthocyanins and glucurono-conjugated derivatives) differed according to the organ considered. The bladder contained the highest levels of anthocyanins followed by the prostate. Prostate, testes and heart contained native cyanidin 3-glucoside and a small proportion of cyanidin monoglucuronide. Cyanidin 3-glucoside and methylated derivatives were present in adipose tissue. Thus, anthocyanin feeding in rats resulted in a wide distribution of anthocyanin derivatives to several organs. Identification of target tissues of anthocyanins may then help to understand the mechanisms of action of anthocyanins in vivo.","340.0"
"Comparison of flavonoids in bran of four classes of wheat","","Foxtail millet attracts much attention for its rich nutrients and health benefits. However, ultra-polishing has greatly reduced its nutrition. Germination can enhance nutrition value. Nevertheless, knowledge of nutrient changes in kernels and sprouted grains under different polishing methods and at different germination stages is limited. Here, comparative metabolomics was used to detect metabolite changes in differently polished millets (Manually Polished Millet, MPM; Ultra-Polished Millet, UPM; Manually Ultra-Polished Millet, MUPM) and in sprouted grains with hot air drying (HAD) and freeze-drying (FD) at different germination times. Compared to whole grains, MPM, UPM, and MUPM had 306 to 720 down-regulated metabolites, reducing most antioxidants, essential amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamins in whole grains. For sprouted grains, metabolic activities were comprehensively activated. The early stages accumulated basic nutrients such as free and functional amino acids, small sugars, and essential fatty acids. The 16 h stage increased secondary antioxidant metabolites like flavonoids, and the 24 h germination generated more functional components such as sulfur-containing metabolites. More basic nutrients were preserved by FD in comparison to the reduced basic nutrients and increased antioxidant accumulation associated with HAD. This work systematically characterizes the metabolite changes in polished millets and sprouted grains, providing a reference for developing functional millet products.","341.0"

The major phenolic compounds present in the raw sample were 5- O-caffeoylquinic and 1,5-di- O-caffeoylquinic acids; after cooking treatments, an increase of the overall caffeoylquinic acids concentration due to the formation of different dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers was observed. Steamed and fried samples showed similar patterns of dicaffeoylquinic concentrations, which were higher with respect to the boiled samples. On the other hand, all cooking practices, particularly frying, decreased flavonoid concentration. The antioxidant capacity of cooked artichokes, measured by three different assays, enormously increased after cooking, particularly after steaming (up to 15-fold) and boiling (up to 8-fold). The observed cooking effect on the artichoke antioxidant profile is probably due to matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, but the increase of antioxidant capacity is much higher than the increase of antioxidant concentration. These results suggest that some common cooking treatments can be used to enhance the nutritional value of vegetables, increasing bioaccessibility of health-promoting constituents.","342.0"

These acylated derivatives are reported for the first time in nature, with the exception of kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside. Quantification of the identified compounds was achieved by HPLC-DAD and carried out in samples cultivated under conventional or organic practices and collected at different times. In general, samples from organic production exhibited higher total phenolics content than those from conventional practices collected in the same period.","344.0"
"Bioavailability of gallic acid and catechins from grape seed polyphenol extract is improved by repeated dosing in rats: implications for treatment in Alzheimer's disease","19625746.0","The present study explored the bioavailability and brain deposition of a grape seed polyphenolic extract (GSPE) previously found to attenuate cognitive deterioration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma pharmacokinetic response of major GSPE phenolic components was measured following intragastric gavage of 50, 100, and 150 mg GSPE per kg body weight. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis identified gallic acid (GA), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) in plasma of rats gavaged acutely with GSPE. Additionally, 4-methylgallic acid (4-OMeGA), 3'-methylcatechin (3'-OMeC), and 3'-methylepicatechin (3'-OMeEC) were identified as circulating metabolites of GSPE phenolic constituents. Cmax for individual GSPE constituents and their metabolites increased in a dose-dependent fashion (with increasing GSPE oral dose). Repeated daily exposure to GSPE was found to significantly increase bioavailability (defined as plasma AUC0-8h) of GA, C, and EC by 198, 253, and 282% relative to animals receiving only a single acute GSPE dose. EC and C were not detectable in brain tissues of rats receiving a single GSPE dose but reached levels of 290.7 +/-45.9 and 576.7 +/- 227.7 pg/g in brain tissues from rats administered GSPE for 10 days. This study suggests that brain deposition of GA, C, and EC is affected by repeated dosing of GSPE.","345.0"
"Determination of free phenolic acids in wort and beer by coulometric array detection","12617582.0","The simultaneous determination of 19 phenolic compounds was performed directly in wort and beer by a combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with coulometric array detection. Chromatographic separation was achieved with an appropriate gradient of flow and a binary solvent based on phosphate buffer, methanol, and acetonitrile in a 45-min run. Eight serial coulometric detectors were used for on-line generation of voltammetric data to resolve coeluting compounds. The method was reliable and sensitive, the regression coefficient of standard calibration curves is 0.972 < or = r < or = 1.000, and the standard deviation value ranges from 0.010 to 0.129 mg/L for wort and from 0.002 to 0.332 mg/L for beer. The mean concentrations of phenolic acids were 22.1 and 33.8 mg/L, respectively, in worts and beers produced in Italy.

"Antioxidant effect of two virgin olive oils depends on the concentration and composition of minor polar compounds","16608240.0","In vitro studies show that some individual minor polar phenolic compounds (MPC) present in virgin olive oil prevent oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins (LDL), but few data are available on the antioxidant effect of whole oil extract. Thus, whole virgin olive extracts were studied to determine whether they maintain the antioxidant activity and whether this last is linked to MPC composition of a single virgin oil. Using HPLC-DAD the MPC content in Taggiasca and Seggianese virgin olive oils was measured. Taggiasca oil was less rich in total MPC (208.5 mg/L) than Seggianese oil (441.9 mg/L). In addition, the major compounds of Taggiasca oil were lignan derivatives, whereas the major compounds in Seggianese oils were secoiridoid derivatives. Moreover, Taggiasca oil was practically free of 5-hydroxytyrosol and 5-hydroxytyrosol derivatives, deacetoxy-oleuropein aglycone and oleuropein aglycone. The antioxidant activity of the oils on human LDL was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde and conjugate diene generation induced by copper ions. In both tests, the oil extracts dose-dependently reduced malondialdehyde and conjugate diene generation. Moreover, antioxidant potency correlated with total MPC; thus, Seggianese extract was more active. The two oils differed quantitatively and qualitatively, and these differences influenced their biological activities; thus clinical trials focused on studying the effects of olive oils should specify the oils used.","347.0"
"Daidzein and genistein concentrations in human milk after soy consumption","8665689.0","Soy isoflavones were quantified from human milk by a fast, precise, and selective HPLC method after enzymatic hydrolysis of conjugated isoflavones and extraction with ethyl acetate.

"Isoflavone levels in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and Hawaii","10552401.0","Concentrations and glucosidic conjugation patterns of isoflavones were determined in soy foods consumed by multiethnic populations in Singapore and Hawaii. Six raw and 11 cooked food groups traditionally consumed in Singapore and 8 food groups consumed in Hawaii were analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Mean total isoflavone levels varied between 35 and 7500 ppm, with the lowest values found in soy milk and burgers and the highest levels observed in soybean and its seeds and in supplements. Total isoflavone levels and conjugation patterns varied as a function of soybean variety, storage conditions, and food processing. A large contribution to the differences in total isoflavone content between food groups was due to the water content in foods and to leaching of polar analytes into the water phase during boiling. Soy protein drinks and traditional soy foods were found to possess very similar isoflavone amounts considering usual serving sizes.","351.0"

"Principal phenolic phytochemicals in selected California wines and their antioxidant activity in inhibiting oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins","","The phenolic antioxidant phytochemicals in wines have been implicated for the lower rates of cardiac disease mortality among people drinking wine regularly in certain European populations. The activities of 20 selected California wines in inhibiting the copper-catalyzed oxidation of human low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were determined. This antioxidant activity was related to the major phenolic compounds and not to resveratrol analyzed in wines by HPLC and GC-MS. The relative inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 46 to 100% with the red wines and from 3 to 6% with the white wines. When compared at the same total phenol concentration, the inhibition of LDL oxidation varied from 37 to 65% with the red wines and from 27 to 46% with the white wines. The relative antioxidant activity correlated with total phenol contents of wines (r = 0.94) and with the concentrations of garlic acid (r = 0.92), catechin (r = 0.76), myricetin (r = 0.70), quercetin (r = 0.68), caffeic acid (r = 0.63), rutin (r = 0.50), epicatechin (r = 0.45), cyanidin (r = 0.43), and malvidin 3-glucoside (r = 0.38).

"Fluorescence screening of antioxidant capacity in pumpkin seed oils and other natural oils","","Recent advancements in analytical strategies have enabled the efficient extraction and characterization of bioactive compounds from agri-food bio-residues, emphasizing green chemistry and circular economy principles. This review highlights the valorization of several agri-food bio-residues for the extraction of high-value-added bioactive compounds, particularly polyphenols, tocopherols, carotenoids, and fatty acids, as a biorefinery approach. To this end, the adoption of environmentally friendly extraction technologies is essential to improve performance, reduce energy consumption, and minimize costs. This study therefore examines emerging methodologies such as supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, pulsed electric fields, and matrix solid-phase dispersion, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Additionally, the chemical characterization of these bioactive compounds is explored through spectrophotometric and high-resolution chromatographic techniques, crucial for their accurate identification and quantification. This is complemented by an analysis of bioactivity assays evaluating antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties, with a focus on their applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. However, the analytical control of toxic compounds, such as alkaloids, in these bio-residues is undoubtedly needed.

"Quantification of genistein and genistin in soybeans and soybean products","8655094.0","It has been suggested that the isoflavone, genistein,, may have some role as a chemopreventive agent against cancer in humans. Levels of genistein and its beta-glucoside conjugate, genistin, ingested in soybeans and related bean products by the Japanese were quantified by HPLC, to estimate daily intake of these compounds. Amounts of genistein and genistin in soybeans, soy nuts and soy powder were in the range of 4.6 to 18.2 and 200.6 to 968.1 micrograms/g food, respectively. The values for soy milk and tofu (bean curd) were 1.9 to 13.9 and 94.8 to 137.7 micrograms/g food, respectively. Levels of isoflavones in fermented soybean products, miso (bean paste) and natto (fermented soybeans), were 38.5 to 229.1 micrograms/g food for genistein and 71.7 to 492.8 micrograms/g food for genistin. Thus, the level of genistein in the fermented soybean products was higher than in soy beans and soybean products such as soy milk and tofu. From these observations, it is suggested that the beta-glycosyl bond of genistin is cleaved to produce genistein by microbes during fermentation to yield miso and natto. Soy sauce was also found to contain both isoflavones, but at levels lower than in miso and natto. On the basis of these data for average annual consumption of soybeans and related products, daily intake of genistein and genistin by the Japanese is calculated to be 1.5-4.1 and 6.3-8.3 mg/person, respectively. These levels are much higher than those for Americans or Western Europeans, whose mortality rates for breast, colon and prostate cancers are greater than the Japanese.","359.0"

"Hydroxycinnamic acid composition and in vitro antioxidant activity of selected grain fractions","","This study was designed to determine the composition in hydroxycinnamic acids and the antioxidant properties of soluble extracts from wheat, rye and buckwheat. Free, soluble and insoluble hydroxycinnamic acids were determined by HPLC-diode array (DAD). Some C-glycosyl flavonoid derivatives were also identified by LC/MS/MS. Total antioxidant capacity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and scavenging of oxygen radicals were used to evaluate the in vitro antioxidant capacity of the cereal soluble extracts. The highest levels of total hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives were found in the wheat bran and rye bran fractions whereas the buckwheat flours had only trace quantities of these compounds. The most abundant compound present in the wheat and rye fractions was ferulic acid but small quantities of diferulic acids, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid and benzoic acid derivatives were also present. The largest proportions of these phenolic compounds were found covalently bound (esters) in the insoluble pellet but between 10% and 30% of the total compounds were solubilized, mostly in water. Most of the antioxidant capacity was found in the water extracts from all the cereal fractions. Overall, buckwheat and wheat germ products exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity whereas the rye products had the lowest antioxidant values. The antioxidant capacity of these complex cereal extracts cannot be explained by simple correlation with the content of total soluble hydroxycinnamic acids.

"LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of ethyl gallate and its major metabolite in rat plasma","19688816.0","A simple, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of ethyl gallate, a pharmacologically active constituent isolated from Lagerstroemia speciosa (Linn.) Pers. This method was used to examine the pharmacokinetics of ethyl gallate and its major metabolite gallic acid in rat plasma using propyl gallate as an internal standard. After precipitation of the plasma proteins with acetonitrile, the analytes were separated on a Zorbax SB-C(18) column (3.5 microm, 2.1 x 50 mm) with an isocratic mobile phase consisted of methanol-acetonitrile-10 mM ammonium acetate (10 : 25 : 65, v/v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min. The Agilent G6410A triple quadrupole LC/MS system was operated under the multiple-reaction monitoring mode using the electrospray ionization technique in negative mode. The lower limits of quantification of gallic acid and ethyl gallate of the method were 0.5 and 1.0 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of the assay were less than 8.0%. This method has been applied successfully to a pharmacokinetic study involving the intragastric administration of ethyl gallate to rats.","368.0"
"Hard-to-cook beans (Phaseolus vulgaris): involvement of phenolic compounds and pectates","","Hard-to-cook (HTC) is a textural defect that affects legume seeds stored in adverse conditions. Phenolic acids were extracted from dehulled soft (control) and HTC beans. HPLC analyses of the phenolic fractions indicated the presence of caffeic, p-coumaric, sinapic, and ferulic acids. The highest content of phenolic acids was present as methanol-soluble esters in the control samples (approximately 45 times more than in HTC). Phenolic acids bound to the water-soluble pectin fraction were 2 times higher in HTC than in control beans, wheras the content of ferulic acid bound to the water-insoluble residue of the cell walls was 4 times higher in the control than in HTC samples. Through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy accumulation of pectates and binding of phenolics to cell wall components were detected in HTC samples.","369.0"
"Study of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oils of the Picual variety","","Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, combined with multivariate calibration techniques such as stepwise decorrelation of variables (SELECT) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, was used to develop robust, reduced-spectrum regression models for quantifying key phenolic compound markers in various olive oils. These oils included nine extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) varieties, refined olive oil (ROO) blended with virgin olive oil (VOO) or EVOO, and pomace olive oil, both with and without hydroxytyrosol (HTyr) supplementation. Olive oils were analyzed before and after deep frying. The results show that HTyr ranged from 7.28 mg/kg in Manzanilla (lowest) to 21.43 mg/kg in Royuela (highest). Tyrosol (Tyr) varied from 5.87 mg/kg in Royuela (lowest) to 14.86 mg/kg in Hojiblanca (highest). Similar trends were observed in all phenolic fractions across olive oil cultivars before and after deep-frying. HTyr supplementation significantly increased both HTyr and Tyr levels in non-fried and fried supplemented oils, with HTyr rising from single digits in some controls (around 0 mg/kg) to over 300 mg/kg in most of the supplemented samples. SELECT efficiently reduced redundancy by selecting the most vital wavelengths and thus significantly improved the regression models for key phenolic compounds, including HTyr, Tyr, caffeic acid, decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycone in dialdehyde form (oleocanthal), decarboxymethyl oleuropein aglycone in dialdehyde form (oleacein), homovanillic acid, pinoresinol, oleuropein aglycone in oxidized aldehyde and hydroxylic form (OAOAH), ligstroside aglycone in oxidized aldehyde and hydroxylic form (LAOAH), and total phenolic content (TPC), achieving correlation coefficients (R) of 0.91-0.98. The SELECT-OLS method generated highly predictive models with minimal complexity, using at most 30 wavelengths out of 700. The number of decorrelated predictors varied, at 12, 14, 15, 30, 30, 21, 30, 30, 30, and 18 for HTyr, Tyr, caffeic acid, oleocanthal, oleacein, homovanillic acid, pinoresinol, OAOAH, LAOAH, and TPC, respectively, demonstrating the adaptability of the SELECT-OLS approach to different spectral patterns. These reliable calibration models enabled online and routine quantification of phenolic compounds in EVOO, VOO, ROO, including both non-fried and fried as well as supplemented and non-supplemented samples. They performed well across eight deep-frying conditions (3-6 h at 170-210 °C). Implementing an NIR instrument with optimized variable selection would simplify spectral analysis and reduce costs. The developed models all demonstrated strong predictive performance, with low leave-one-out mean prediction errors (LOOMPEs) with values of 15.69, 8.47, 3.64, 9.18, 16.71, 3.26, 8.57, 13.56, 56.36, and 82.38 mg/kg for HTyr, Tyr, caffeic acid, oleocanthal, oleacein, homovanillic acid, pinoresinol, OAOAH, LAOAH, and TPC, respectively. These results confirm that NIR spectroscopy combined with SELECT-OLS is a feasible, rapid, non-destructive, and eco-friendly tool for the reliable evaluation and quantification of phenolic content in edible oils.","370.0"
"Phenolic content of commercial olive oils","","This multidisciplinary comparative study investigates consumption patterns, health-related properties, and quality attributes of trademarked and local extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) samples. It highlights the importance of localization in promoting agricultural sustainability, strengthening regional economies, and enhancing socio-economic impacts within EVOO production and consumption systems. In terms of quality characteristics, significant differences were observed in color parameters (L*, a*, b*, Chroma, Hue angle) among EVOO samples (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Regarding nutritional and functional properties, total phenolic content (TPC) measured with the Folin-Ciocalteu method ranged from 58.15 to 176.29 mg of gallic acid equivalents/kg of oil, while total antioxidant capacity (TAC) measured by CUPRAC and DPPH assays varied between 3.42 and 6.54 and 8.56-10.71 µmol of Trolox equivalents/g of oil, respectively. TPC and TAC were also evaluated for their stability during in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion, demonstrating that EVOO's bioactive potential remains stable under gastric and intestinal conditions. Local samples exhibited significantly higher TACs than trademarked products across undigested, gastric, and intestinal phases (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Concurrently, a face-to-face consumer survey assessed purchasing behaviors and preferences, revealing that 71.3% of consumers preferred local EVOO and showed a low tendency to purchase commercial brands (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Cooperatives were identified as the main distribution channel, playing a crucial role in sustaining local production systems. This study offers valuable insights into EVOO's bioactive content and consumer behavior, providing a foundation for developing both localized and commercial products that support health outcomes. Additionally, the findings contribute to policy development concerning sustainable food systems and geographical indications.","371.0"
"Red wine anthocyanins are rapidly absorbed in humans and affect monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 levels and antioxidant capacity of plasma","18789665.0","Epidemiological studies suggest that a moderate consumption of anthocyanins may be associated with protection against coronary heart disease. The main dietary sources of anthocyanins include red-coloured fruits and red wine. Although dietary anthocyanins comprise a diverse mixture of molecules, little is known how structural diversity relates to their bioavailability and biological function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the absorption and metabolism of the 3-monoglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin in humans and to examine both the effect of consuming a red wine extract on plasma antioxidant status and on monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 production in healthy human subjects. After a 12-h overnight fast, seven healthy volunteers received 12 g of an anthocyanin extract and provided 13 blood samples in the 24 h following the test meal. Furthermore, urine was collected during this 24-h period. Anthocyanins were detected in their intact form in both plasma and urine samples. Other anthocyanin metabolites could also be detected in plasma and urine and were identified as glucuronides of peonidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins and their metabolites appeared in plasma about 30 min after ingestion of the test meal and reached their maximum value around 1.6 h later for glucosides and 2.5 h for glucuronides. Total urinary excretion of red wine anthocyanins was 0.05+/-0.01% of the administered dose within 24 h. About 94% of the excreted anthocyanins was found in urine within 6 h. In spite of the low concentration of anthocyanins found in plasma, an increase in the antioxidant capacity and a decrease in MCP-1 circulating levels in plasma were observed.","372.0"
"Ferulic acid dehydromers from wheat bran: isolation, purification and antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diferulic acid","9754331.0","Wheat bran contains several ester-linked dehydrodimers of ferulic acid, which were detected and quantified after sequential alkaline hydrolysis. The major dimers released were: trans-5-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-7-methoxy-2, 3- dihydrobenzofuran-3-carboxylic acid (5-8-BendiFA), (Z)-beta-[4-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy]-4-hydroxy-3-methox ycinnamic acid (8-O-4-diFA) and (E,E)-4,4'-dihydroxy-5,5'-dimethoxy-3,3'-bicinnamic acid (5-5-diFA). trans-7-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-1,2-dihydro - naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (8-8-diFA cyclic form) and 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-beta,beta'-bicinnamic acid (8-8-diFA non cyclic form) were not detected. One of the most abundant dimers, 8-O-4-diFA, was purified from de-starched wheat bran after alkaline hydrolysis and preparative HPLC. The resultant product was identical to the chemically synthesised 8-O-4-dimer by TLC and HPLC as confirmed by 1H-NMR and mass spectrometry. The absorption maxima and absorption coefficients for the synthetic compound in ethanol were: lambda max: 323 nm, lambda min: 258 nm, epsilon lambda max (M-1 cm-1): 24,800 +/- 2100 and epsilon 280 (M-1 cm-1): 19,700 +/- 1100. The antioxidant properties of 8-O-4-diFA were assessed using: (a) inhibition of ascorbate/iron-induced peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine liposomes and; (b) scavenging of the radical cation of 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) relative to the water-soluble vitamin E analogue, Trolox C. The 8-O-4-diFA was a better antioxidant than ferulic acid in both lipid and aqueous phases. This is the first report of the antioxidant activity of a natural diferulate obtained from a plant.","373.0"
"Effect of Thermal and High-Pressure Processing on the Nutritional Value and Quality Attributes of a Nectarine Puree with Industrial Origin during the Refrigerated Storage","22417344.0","The application of hydrostatic high pressure on an industrial line of nectarine (Prunus persica L.) purées was assessed in comparison with the traditional thermal treatment of pasteurization. Changes after thermal processing (85 °C, 5 min) and after high-pressure processing (HPP: 450 or 600 MPa for 5 or 10 min) and during the refrigerated storage (60 d) of an industrially produced nectarine purée were evaluated. Conventional heat pasteurization as well as HPP showed similar microorganisms' inactivation and maintained the microbial stability of purées until the end of the refrigerated storage (60 d). In general, thermally treated purée and HP-treated purée at 600 MPa showed more intense color changes after processing than the other treatment. In addition, thermally treated purée showed more intense color changes during storage than HPP. The highest carotenoids extractability was found in those purées treated at the lowest high-pressure-treatment intensity and holding time (450 MPa/5 min), but at the end of the storage (day 60), no differences in individual or total carotenoid levels were found between the purées. HPP at 600 MPa/10 min showed the highest polyphenols content after the treatment and during the storage. At day 0, significantly higher values were found of total antioxidant activity in purée HP-treated at 450 MPa/10 min than in untreated purée; while at the end of the storage, HP-treated purée at 600 MPa/10 min had the highest antioxidant activity. Hydrostatic high-pressure application in the industrial line of nectarine purée presented some advantages compared to the thermal treatment; however, some of the changes found were lessen during the storage period. In addition, more studies need to be carried out for HP-treatment intensity optimization.","374.0"
"Differentiation of wine vinegars based on phenolic composition","","Phenolic composition of 92 wine vinegars produced from different wines from the south of Spain (Jerez, Montilla, El Condado) is determined by HPLC with diode array detection. Pattern recognition techniques were applied to distinguish between different methods of elaboration (slow traditional methods with surface culture or quick methods carried out in bioreactors with submerged culture) or wines employed as substrate. Multivariate analysis of data includes principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as well as artificial neural networks trained by back-propagation (BPANN). The classification depending on the acetification process leads to good recalling rates in both LDA (mean = 92.5) and BPANN (mean = 99.6). With respect to the classification on the basis of the geographical origin, the obtained recalling rates were 88.8 for LDA and of 96.5 for BPANN (mean values).","375.0"

"Influence of variety, maturity and processing on phenolic compounds of apricot juices and jams","","Fruits, such as apricots, cherries, raspberries, and strawberries, are very often processed into jams to extend their shelf life. Jams are highly appreciated by consumers, and their storage conditions are important for preserving their quality. This study investigates the impact of storage on the microbiological quality and physicochemical parameters of five commercial fruit (apricot, sour cherry, white cherry, raspberry, and strawberry) jams. The pH, titratable acidity, moisture, sugar content, viscosity, and color were evaluated immediately after opening the jam containers and during storage at 2-4 °C and 20 °C. The total number of mesophilic aerobic germs (TMAG) and the total number of yeasts and molds (TYM) were also determined. The samples were analyzed during storage at 14, 42, and 56 days after opening the jam jars. The pH of the fruit jam samples varied from 2.91 (strawberry jam) to 3.47 (sour cherry jam) and decreased during storage, while the titratable acidity (TA) ranged from 0.46 (cherry and raspberry jams) to 0.52% malic acid (apricot jam) and increased during storage, regardless of the storage temperature. The moisture content was between 15.78% (apricot jam) and 21.82% (raspberry jam), and decreased in all the jam samples during storage. The sugar content (30.40-44.59 g per 100 g of jam) was typical for low-sweetened jams and increased during storage. Also, the viscosity of the fruit jam samples increased during storage (more in the samples stored at room temperature). Under the storage conditions, all the jam samples lost their specific color. Immediately after opening the jam jars, no yeasts or molds were found in the apricot and sour cherry jam samples. The highest number of yeasts and molds was detected in the white cherry jam samples (4.25 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g). The TYM increased during storage, as did the TMAG. The time-temperature interaction factor influenced the physicochemical and microbiological properties of the jam samples.","377.0"
"Determination of authenticity of fruit jams by HPLC analysis of anthocyanins","","A HPLC technique for the analysis of anthocyanins from various fruit jams is described and used to monitor the stability of anthocyanins during processing.

Anthocyanin content was determined by HPLC. The effect of cultivar, processing and storage on jam pigments, instrumental color (L*, a*, b*) and consumer preference were also determined. 'Oso grande' jam had the lowest anthocyanin concentration (110 mg/g f.w), higher monomeric pigment degradation during processing and storage, highest pH, least desirable color score from the sensory panel and shortest shelf-life. Similarities were found between jams prepared with 'Chandler' and 'Tudla' cultivars, as well as initial differences in total anthocyanin concentrations (195 and 130 mg/g f.w.).","379.0"
"Evaluation of propolis polyphenols absorption in humans by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry","17979105.0","Propolis has various biological activities such as antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, immunostimulating and antiinflammatory, which are generally ascribed to the polyphenolic fraction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of the main polyphenols [caffeic acid (CA), pinobanksin-5methyl ether (P-5ME), pinobanksin (Pb), chrysin (C), pinocembrin (P), galangin (G), pinobanksin-3-acetate, pinobanksin esters and caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE)] from a dewaxed and standardized extract of propolis (EPID). Fifteen healthy volunteers consumed 5 mL EPID in water, corresponding to 125 mg of flavonoids. Blood samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after EPID intake. After deconjugation by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase the plasma samples were analyzed by a selective liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method using morin as internal standard (I.S.). A kinetic profile characterized by two t(max), respectively at 1 h and about 5 h post-ingestion, was observed in all the subjects. The two peaks may be due to enterohepatic cycling. Among the various polyphenols ingested, only P-5ME, Pb, C, P and G were detected in plasma and C(max)t(1h) were 65.7 +/- 13.3, 46.5 +/- 12.7, 79.5 +/- 18.6, 168.1 +/- 16.3 and 113.7 +/- 16.8 ng/mL, respectively. These levels decreased significantly after 8 h and were no longer detectable 24 h after EPID intake. The recovery of the extraction for CA, Pb, C, P, G and I.S. from spiked plasma was 95.2 +/- 3.1, 93.1 +/- 3.6, 91 +/- 2.5, 96.4 +/- 4.2, 93.4 +/- 2.4 and 85.5 +/- 2.4%, respectively. The results of this study evidence that flavonoids from EPID are absorbed, metabolized and Pb-5ME and G seem to have apparent absorption, measured as (AUC/dose), higher than C, P and Pb.","380.0"
"Flavanone plasma pharmacokinetics from blood orange juice in human subjects","17367568.0","Some blood orange juice (BOJ) flavanones may have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, hypolipidaemic, vasoprotective and anticarcinogenic properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of hesperetin and naringenin in human subjects after BOJ intake. In a cross-over study, seven healthy female volunteers consumed 150 and 300 ml BOJ corresponding to about 51-102 mg hesperetin and to 6-12 mg naringenin, respectively. Plasma samples were collected before, each hour for 8 h and 24 h after BOJ administration and analysed for their content of hesperetin and naringenin by liquid chromatography-MS/MS. The plasma concentrations of these compounds were dose dependent and the peak concentration (Cmax) was reached in 5.1 (sd 0.6) h after BOJ intake. The Cmax of hesperetin was 43.4 (sd 32.4) and 79.8 (sd 60.1) ng/ml after 150 and 300 ml intake, respectively. For naringenin the plasma peak was 16.4 (sd 11.9) and 34.0 (sd 20.6) ng/ml. Moreover, the conjugated forms of these flavanones represent more than 95 % of the plasma concentration. The results indicate that both hesperetin and naringenin are bioavailable after BOJ intake; naringenin seemingly more so than hesperetin.","381.0"
"The relative contributions of vitamin C, carotenoids and phenolics to the antioxidant potential of fruit juices","","Consumer demands for fresh and minimally processed liquid foods that support disease prevention and promote health emphasize the need for innovative processing technologies that ensure microbiological safety and preserve bioactive compounds. In addition, consumers are becoming more concerned about the presence of chemical additives in liquid foods. Non-thermal processing technologies, including high-pressure processing, high-pressure homogenization, pulsed electric field, pulsed magnetic field, high-pressure carbon dioxide, ultrasound treatment, radiation processing, ozone processing, cold plasma, and membrane processing, offer excellent prospects for the application in liquid foods. The given technologies aim to retain bioactive properties, deactivate enzymatic activity, and destroy microorganisms, thereby extending the shelf life of liquid foods. Thus, this current review, without a doubt, could be valuable to the liquid food industries and the scientific world by offering great insight into the latest developments in the use of innovative non-thermal processing technologies, which can be employed for shelf life extension and the retention of bioactive compounds in liquid foods. This paper also discusses the challenges faced by the liquid food industry that need to be addressed in future studies.","382.0"
"Effect of hydrothermal treatment on the antioxidant properties of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis italica) florets","26003363.0","In the extracts of fresh raw and frozen broccoli, caffeic, ferulic, sinapinic acids and kaempferol were identified. Boiling reduced the amounts of caffeic acid and kaempferol in both samples. The concentration of polyphenols was 2.69mg/g fresh mass and 0.96mg/fresh mass in fresh raw broccoli and frozen raw broccoli, respectively. Boiling significantly decreased the amounts of phenolic compounds in fresh broccoli (1.58mg/g of fresh mass). In the case of frozen broccoli, boiling increased the concentration of polyphenols by 38%. Fresh broccoli extract neutralized free radicals by 19.87%. Boiling significantly reduced its antiradical activity (to 15.06%). Samples of frozen broccoli had a 27.06% antiradical ability. Boiling did not change the antiradical activity in frozen broccoli case. Hydrothermal processing significantly influenced on the ability of the extracts to inhibit the decolorization of β-carotene emulsion. The extract of fresh broccoli had a higher activity when uncooked. Boiling seemed to increase this activity in the case of frozen broccoli samples. The results of the studies on the ability of broccoli extracts to inhibit linoleic acid autooxidation were ambiguous and depended on the method applied. No correlation was found between the content of phenolic compounds and the antioxidant activity of the extracts, regardless of the experimental variant and technique used.","383.0"

"Flavonoid and carbohydrate contents in Tropea red onions: effects of homelike peeling and storage","11902931.0","The content of anthocyanins, flavonols, and carbohydrates of Tropea red onions (Allium cepa L.) was determined by HPLC and HPLC-MS. Cyanidin derivatives constitute >50% of total anthocyanins, but delphinidin and petunidin derivatives, which have not been reported in red onions thus far, were also detected. The flavonoid distribution in the different layers of the bulbs indicates that, after homelike peeling, the edible portion contains 79% of the total content of quercetin 4'-glucoside but only 27% of the anthocyanins. Storage of onions for 6 weeks in different conditions, all of them mimicking home storage habits, resulted in a decrease to 64-73% of total anthocyanins. The same trend was verified for the total antioxidant activity, which was reduced to 29-36%. A decrease in glucose and fructose content correlated with anthocyanin degradation was also observed. Storage at low temperature seems to better preserve the onion anthocyanins.","385.0"
"Antioxidants in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) as a function of genotype","","Microplastic pollution is a largely unexplored yet pervasive environmental problem, in terrestrial environments, including impacts on plants and food crops. Plant growth and function are most often negatively impacted by plastic exposure, but these pollutants can also stimulate plant processes such as root growth and there is a tentative suggestion that monocotyledonous may be less sensitive to microplastics than dicotyledonous plants. Toxic effects include reduced plant biomass, chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, and changes to antioxidants, metabolites, and nutrients, with stimulatory effects often found at lower concentrations of exposure. There is strong evidence that roots can directly uptake and translocate plastic particles at 1 µm and under in size. Indirect effects include interactions of microplastics with other pollutants, soil properties, and soil organisms. These findings have potentially wide-ranging implications for terrestrial ecosystem function and human health. Future research should further elucidate the mechanisms of plant microplastic toxicity at realistic concentrations. This short review highlights the significance of microplastics in the terrestrial environment, where they can occur at higher concentrations than in the aquatic environment, with likely impacts on important food crop plants. The significance of these findings for human and ecosystem health remains to be elucidated and we make four recommendations to the scientific community for improved future experimentation.","386.0"
"Changes in the contents of carotenoids, phenolic compounds and vitamin C during technical processing and lyophilisation of red and yellow tomatoes","","We present the results of the first study on the impact of thermal processing and lyophilisation on three major micronutrient families: carotenoids, total polyphenols and vitamin C in two different tomato cultivars: a red tomato (RT) and a yellow one (YT). Micronutrients were analysed in fresh tomatoes, tomato purée and lyophilised tomatoes. YT contained no lycopene, lower β-carotene, similar vitamin C and higher total polyphenol contents than RT. Processing did not affect the carotenoid content in RT, but significantly lowered β-carotene in YT and also the contents of total polyphenol and vitamin C in both cultivars. Lyophilisation lowered the carotenoid content in RT but not in YT; in contrast, the total polyphenol content was preserved in RT but lowered in YT, and the vitamin C content was not affected in both cultivars. These results provide new data on the effect of thermal processing and lyophilisation on the content of the three main families of micronutrients in red and yellow tomatoes.","387.0"
"Antioxidant activity of different phenolic fractions separated from an Italian red wine","10554247.0","Using liquid/liquid extraction, three fractions were obtained from an Italian red wine containing single polyphenolic subfractions: (1) phenolic acids and quercetin-3-glucuronide, (2) catechins and quercetin-3-glucoside, and (3) anthocyanins. Beside the scavenging capacity of the different fractions against hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals, the in vitro inhibition of low density lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation (two main events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis) were tested. The antioxidant activity of the fractions has been compared with that of the original red wine before and after dealcoholization. The anthocyanin fraction was the most effective both in scavenging reactive oxygen species and in inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation and platelet aggregation. This higher activity can be explained by both its high concentration in red wine and its antioxidant efficiency, which, at least for peroxyl radical scavenging, was three times as high as that of the other two fractions. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could be the key component in red wine in light of the protection against cardiovascular diseases, although this hypothesis needs in vivo evidence.","388.0"

The total flavonoid content (approximately 1000 mg kg(-)(1) f.w.) remained quite constant during storage in both air and MAP atmospheres, while vitamin C (750 mg kg(-)(1)f.w.) was better preserved in MAP-stored spinach. AA was transformed to DHAA during storage, and its concentration was higher in MAP-stored tissues. The free-radical scavenging activity of the isolated flavonoids was tested, and only those flavonoids with either a dihydroxyl grouping or acylated with ferulic acid showed significant activity. A decrease in the total antioxidant activity was observed during storage, particularly important in MAP-stored spinach. The higher content of DHAA and lower content of both AA and antioxidant flavonoids in the MAP-stored samples could explain this antioxidant activity decrease. Boiling extracted 50% of total flavonoids and 60% vitamin C in the cooking water. However, flavonoid glucuronides were extracted more in the cooking water than the other glycosides. The vitamin C content of the cooked tissue was higher in those samples stored in MAP.","391.0"
"Antioxidant activity of pomegranate juice and its relationship with phenolic composition and processing","11052704.0","The antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices was evaluated by four different methods (ABTS, DPPH, DMPD, and FRAP) and compared to those of red wine and a green tea infusion. Commercial pomegranate juices showed an antioxidant activity (18-20 TEAC) three times higher than those of red wine and green tea (6-8 TEAC). The activity was higher in commercial juices extracted from whole pomegranates than in experimental juices obtained from the arils only (12-14 TEAC). HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS analyses of the juices revealed that commercial juices contained the pomegranate tannin punicalagin (1500-1900 mg/L) while only traces of this compound were detected in the experimental juice obtained from arils in the laboratory. This shows that pomegranate industrial processing extracts some of the hydrolyzable tannins present in the fruit rind. This could account for the higher antioxidant activity of commercial juices compared to the experimental ones. In addition, anthocyanins, ellagic acid derivatives, and hydrolyzable tannins were detected and quantified in the pomegranate juices.","392.0"
"In vitro availability of flavonoids and other phenolics in orange juice","11262068.0","Hand-squeezed navel orange juice contains 839 mg/L phenolics, including flavanones, flavones, and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. The flavanones are the main phenolics in the soluble fraction (648.6 mg/L) and are also present in the cloud fraction (104.8 mg/L). During refrigerated storage of fresh juice (4 degrees C), 50% of the soluble flavanones precipitate and integrate into the cloud fraction. Commercial orange juices contain only 81-200 mg/L soluble flavanones (15-33%) and the content in the cloud is higher (206-644 mg/L) (62-85%), showing that during industrial processing and storage the soluble flavanones precipitate and are included in the cloud. An in vitro simulation of orange juice digestion shows that a serving of fresh orange juice (240 mL) provides 9.7 mg of soluble hesperidin (4'-methoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavanone-7-rutinoside) and 4.7 mg of the C-glycosylflavone vicenin 2 (apigenin, 6,8-di-C-glucoside) for freshly squeezed orange juice, whereas pasteurized commercial juices provide 3.7 mg of soluble hesperidin and a higher amount of vicenin 2 (6.3 mg). This means that although orange juice is a very rich source of flavanones, only a limited quantity is soluble, and this might affect availability for absorption (11-36% of the soluble flavanones, depending on the juice). The flavanones precipitated in the cloud are not available for absorption and are partly transformed to the corresponding chalcones during the pancreatin-bile digestion.","393.0"

"Influence of industrial processing on orange juice flavanone solubility and transformation to chalcones under gastrointestinal conditions","12720386.0","Orange juice manufactured at industrial scale was subjected to digestion under in vitro gastrointestinal conditions (pH, temperature, and enzyme and chemical conditions) to evaluate the influence of individual industrial processing treatments on flavanone solubility, stability, and ability to permeate through a membrane under simulated physiological conditions. Four industrial processes including squeezing, standard pasteurization, concentration, and freezing were evaluated. Hand squeezing was compared with industrial squeezing. After in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of the orange juices, the flavanones able to permeate through a dialysis membrane, and those remaining in the retentate were evaluated by HPLC as were those present in the insoluble fraction. In all of the assayed orange juices, a high content of precipitated chalcones ( approximately 70% of the total flavanones) was formed under the physiological conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Hand squeezing provided a higher concentration of flavanones in the permeated fraction and lower transformation to chalcones than industrial squeezing. Standard pasteurization did not influence the solubility and permeability of the orange juice flavanones and chalcones. Industrial concentration did not affect the amount of flavanones able to permeate but decreased the chalcones produced. Juices produced from frozen orange juice contained considerably smaller amounts of both soluble flavanones and insoluble chalcones.","395.0"

An LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous determination of D3G and C3G in human plasma and urine was developed and validated. After sample preparation by SPE, chromatographic separation was performed with an RP-C(18) column, using a water/methanol linear gradient. The quantitation of target compounds was determined by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, using ESI. The method showed good selectivity, sensitivity (LOD = 0.05 and 0.10 ng/mL for C3G in plasma and urine, respectively; LOD = 0.10 ng/mL for D3G in plasma and urine), linearity (0.20-200 ng/mL; r >or= 0.998), intra- and interday precision and accuracy (<or= 14.6%) and satisfactory recoveries (80.0-110.4%) for the target compounds in both plasma and urine.

"Effect of shallow frying on total phenolic content and antioxidant activity in selected vegetables","","This review provides an overview of the main vegetable oils of different botanical origin and composition that can be used for frying worldwide (olive and extra-virgin olive oil, high-oleic sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, peanut oil, rice bran oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil) and their degradation during this process. It is well known that during this culinary technique, oil's major and minor components degrade throughout different reactions, mainly thermoxidation, polymerization and, to a lesser extent, hydrolysis. If severe high temperatures are employed, isomerization to <i>trans</i> fatty acyl chains and cyclization are also possible. The factors conditioning frying medium degradation are addressed, including oil composition (unsaturation degree, fatty acyl chain length and ""free"" fatty acid content, and presence of beneficial and detrimental minor components), together with frying conditions and food characteristics. Likewise, this review also tackles how the frying oil and other processing conditions may impact on fried food quality (oil absorption, texture, flavor and color). Finally, potential health implications of fried food consumption are briefly reviewed.","398.0"
"Quality of commercial apple juices evaluated on the basis of the polyphenol content and the TEAC antioxidant activity","","<h4>Introduction</h4>The interest toward the use of non-<i>Saccharomyces</i> yeasts in the winemaking process has been increasing because it has been demonstrated that they can contribute positively to the quality of wines; however, there is a gap in the literature on holistic approaches showing the effective contribution of non-<i>Saccharomyces</i> yeasts in sequential fermentations.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Two commercial strains of <i>Metschnikowia pulcherrima</i> (Mp) and <i>Torulaspora delbrueckii</i> (Td) were used in sequential fermentations with <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (Sc). The fermentations were monitored by evaluating cell viable counts, ethanol, glycerol, acids, amino acids, phenols, total antioxidant activity, total polysaccharides, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results for amino acids pointed out after 2 days a lower utilization of amino acids by Sc per million of cells than Mp and Td; moreover, yeasts had a different preference hit. There were no significant differences in the final ethanol and glycerol content; however, the sequential fermentation Mp/Sc led to a significant decrease in malic acid levels, while the Td/Sc sequential fermentation resulted in a significantly lower acetic acid levels (13 mg/L vs 95-102 mg/L) and a higher phenol reduction. Finally, VOCs analysis showed differences in some compounds both after 2 days or at the end of fermentation (esters, and ketones, among others). Finally, both sequential fermentations resulted in a higher amount of polysaccharides.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings of this research provide a basis for ensuring better management of sequential wine fermentation, and a possible approach for trials and data management.","399.0"
"Analysis of alkyl- and alkenylresorcinols in Triticale, wheat and rye","","Alkyl- and alkenylresorcinols were extracted with acetone from whole kernels of wheat, rye and various triticales. The resorcinols were ethylated, analysed by GC on a capillary column and further identified by GC-MS. Alkylresorcinols with chain lengths of C15, C17, C19, C21, C23 and C25 and pairs of isomeric C17, C19, C21, C23 and C25 alkenylresorcinols were quantified in all samples. The content of alk(en)ylresorcinols was highest in rye, intermediate in triticale and lowest in wheat. The relative composition of the resorcinols differed between grains, with a higher content of the C19 alkylresorcinol in rye and of the C21 alkylresorcinol in wheat. Wheat and three lines of triticale were harvested at three stages of maturity after the grain filling period was ended (water content approximately 40, 30 and 20 degrees). During this period of time the gross chemical composition, water extract viscosity, and content and relative composition of the alk(en)ylresorcinols, were relatively constant.","400.0"

Since the health benefit of fruits and fruit juices have been ascribed, in part, to the phenolic antioxidants, it is very important to know what the effects of processing steps are on the level of phenolic compounds in fruit juices. The total losses of phenolic compounds were determined to be 28% and 7% during conventional clarification using gelatin and bentonite, and ultrafiltration, respectively. A total of 14 phenolic compounds were identified in apple juice prepared from Golden Delicious apples. The phenolic compounds were found to be based mainly on hydroxycinnamic acids (approximately 50% of total phenolics) and chlorogenic acid was found to be the major phenolic compound with its concentration as high as 465.45 mg l(-1) in raw apple juice.","402.0"
"Assay of Resveratrol Glucosides and Isomers in Wine by Direct-Injection High-Performance Liquid-Chromatography","","Resveratrol is the most important biopotential phytoalexin of the stilbene group (natural polyphenolic secondary metabolites), synthesized naturally by the action of biotic and abiotic factors on the plant. The yield of individual bioactive compounds isolated from grapevine components, products and by-products is directly dependent on the conditions of the synthesis, extraction and identification techniques used. Modern methods of synthesis and extraction, as well as identification techniques, are centred on the use of non-toxic solvents that have the advantages of the realisation of rapid extractions, maintenance of optimal parameters, and low energy consumption; this is a challenge with promising results for various industrial applications. Actionable advances in identifying and analysing stilbenes consist of techniques for coupling synthesis/extraction/identification methods that have proven accurate, reproducible and efficient.

"Resveratrol glucosides are important components of commercial wines","","In this study, the reactivity of procyanidins and anthocyanins in young and aged Prokupac wines toward salivary proteins is investigated via SDS-PAGE and UHPLC-QTOF-MS to determine the differences between the phenolic compounds of red wine in relation to the aging process of wine. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that procyanidins, flavanol-anthocyanin polymers, and ellagitannins in aged wine have strong affinities for salivary proteins, leading to the formation of insoluble complexes. By contrast, young wine contained predominantly procyanidins with high salivary protein affinity, as well as monomeric flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins, which mainly form soluble aggregates, while polymeric phenolics were less represented. Electrophoretic patterns further showed that seed-derived procyanidins mainly formed insoluble complexes with salivary proteins, whereas skin-derived anthocyanins tended to form soluble ones. The total content of all phenolic compounds quantified by UHPLC-QTOF-MS was 2.5 times higher in young wine than in aged wine, primarily due to the significantly greater abundance of malvidine-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside in young wine (eightfold higher level in young wine). Targeted UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis of selected phenolics confirmed the electrophoretic results and showed a higher binding affinity of procyanidins in aged wine compared to young wine, as well as a higher percentage of procyanidin binding compared to anthocyanins, independent of the age of the wine. Sensory evaluation showed that aged wine had higher tannin quality scores, whereas young wine exhibited greater acidity and astringency, with bitterness being comparable between them. These results highlight the influence of wine aging on the interaction between phenolic compounds and salivary proteins and emphasize the dominant role of procyanidins in protein binding and the potential synergistic contribution of anthocyanins to mouthfeel perception.","404.0"
"Catechin and epicatechin concentrations of red wines: regional and cultivar-related differences","","Grape pomace (GP), a significant by-product of winemaking, is gaining increasing recognition for its potential as a source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and cardioprotective properties. This study aimed to characterize the polyphenolic profile, fatty acid composition, and antioxidant activity of 17 GP samples from Transylvanian cultivars. Polyphenolic content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method and high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-ESI MS) analysis. Fatty acid composition was analyzed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). Antioxidant capacity was assessed using five methods, which included the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothialzoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging, ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and reducing power (RP) assays. Additionally, all extracts were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the presence of functional groups and chemical bonds associated with bioactive compounds. The results showed that Neuburger (NE), Radames (RA), and Regent (RE) cultivars had the highest phenolic concentrations, particularly of catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidin dimers. NE and Feteascǎ Regalǎ (FR) exhibited the greatest radical scavenging and electron transfer activities across multiple antioxidant assays. Rose Blaj (RB) and Astra (AS) displayed the most favorable fatty acid profiles, with high unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid (UFA/SFA) and hypocholesterolemic-to-hypercholesterolemic fatty acid (H/H) ratios, as well as low atherogenicity (AI) and thrombogenicity (TI) indices, suggesting cardioprotective potential. Additionally, RB and NE cultivars also demonstrated a strong chelation of Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions, enhancing their antioxidant efficacy by mitigating metal-catalyzed oxidative stress. These findings underscore the potential of GP, particularly from NE, RB, RA, and AS cultivars, the last three of which were homologated in Transylvania at SCDVV Blaj, as valuable sources of health-promoting compounds for use in food, nutraceuticals, and other health-related applications.","405.0"
"Quercetin and p-coumaric acid concentrations in commercial wines","","Malolactic fermentation (MLF), a key enological process for wine deacidification and aroma and flavor development, is predominantly mediated by lactic acid bacteria. This study characterized 342 indigenous <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> (<i>L. plantarum</i>) isolates, a potential starter species underexploited for MLF, from China's Jiaodong Peninsula wine regions through polyphasic analysis. Thirty strains with high tolerance to wine stress conditions and efficient malate metabolism were selected. Among these, two high-performance strains, P101 and J43, exhibited superior MLF kinetics. Their applications had almost no effect on the wine's basic physicochemical parameters, color parameters, and individual phenolic contents. Solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) analysis revealed that these strains significantly enhance key aroma compound contents in wines, including ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, and nerol, contributing more floral and fruity aroma characteristics. These indigenous <i>L. plantarum</i> strains, novel microbial starter cultures, demonstrate dual functionality in enhancing wine quality through controlled fermentation while supporting microbial biodiversity through the development of region-specific strain resources.","406.0"

Ellagic acid was the phenol present in highest concentration in all beverages. Moderate amounts of syringaldehyde, syringic acid, and gallic acid, as well as lesser amounts of vanillin and vanillic acid, were measurable in most samples of whiskey, brandy, and rum but were largely undetectable in gin, vodka, liqueurs, and miscellaneous spirits. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)furfural was the predominant furan in the former three beverages, notably cognac, with 2-furaldehyde the next highest, but these were undetectable in most of the latter beverages. Highest TAS values were given by armagnac, cognac, and bourbon whiskey, all three of which tended toward the highest concentrations of phenols. Negative TAS values were exhibited by rum, vodka, gin, and miscellaneous spirits in line with the low or undetectable phenol concentrations in these beverages. Wood aging is the most likely source of phenols and furans in distilled spirits. Those beverages exposed to this treatment contain significant antioxidant activity, which is between the ranges for white and red wines, with the potential to augment the antiatherosclerotic functions attributable to the ethanol that they contain.","407.0"

The median of total phenols content was 38 ppm (as syringic acid), although a wide range was observed, from 11 to 76 ppm. The main phenols found were the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol (p-HPEA-EDA; 9 +/- 7 ppm, as median and interquartile range), oleuropein aglycon (8 +/- 6 ppm), and the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA; 5 +/- 8 ppm). In many cases the correlation with oxidative stability was higher when the sum of the dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) and oleuropein aglycon (r (2) = 0.91-0.96) or the sum of these two and hydroxytyrosol (r (2) = 0.90-0.97) was considered than was observed with HPLC total phenols (r (2)= 0.91-0.95) and especially with colorimetric determination of total polyphenols and o-diphenols (r (2) = 0.77-0.95 and 0.78-0.92, respectively). 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, the aglycons of oleuropein and ligstroside, and HPLC total phenols content presented highly significant differences (p = 0.001-0.010) with respect to the dual- and triple-phase extraction systems used, whereas colorimetric total polyphenols content did not (p = 0.348) and o-diphenols showed a much lower significant difference (p = 0.031). The five variables that most satisfactorily classified the principal commercial Spanish virgin olive oil varieties were 1-acetoxypinoresinol, 4-(acetoxyethyl)-1,2-dihydroxybenzene (3,4-DHPEA-AC), ligstroside aglycon, p-HPEA-EDA, and RT 43.3 contents.","408.0"
"Changes in phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of virgin olive oil during frying","12537439.0","The concentration of hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA) and its secoiridoid derivatives (3,4-DHPEA-EDA and 3,4-DHPEA-EA) in virgin olive oil decreased rapidly when the oil was repeatedly used for preparing french fries in deep-fat frying operations. At the end of the first frying process (10 min at 180 degrees C), the concentration of the dihydroxyphenol components was reduced to 50-60% of the original value, and after six frying operations only about 10% of the initial components remained. However, tyrosol (p-HPEA) and its derivatives (p-HPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EA) in the oil were much more stable during 12 frying operations. The reduction in their original concentration was much smaller than that for hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives and showed a roughly linear relationship with the number of frying operations. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract measured using the DPPH test rapidly diminished during the first six frying processes, from a total antioxidant activity higher than 740 micromol of Trolox/kg down to less than 250 micromol/kg. On the other hand, the concentration of polar compounds, oxidized triacylglycerol monomers (oxTGs), dimeric TGs, and polymerized TGs rapidly increased from the sixth frying operation onward, when the antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract was very low, and as a consequence the oil was much more susceptible to oxidation. The loss of antioxidant activity in the phenolic fraction due to deep-fat frying was confirmed by the storage oil and oil-in-water emulsions containing added extracts from olive oil used for 12 frying operations.","409.0"
"Phenolic and volatile compounds of extra virgin olive oil (Olea europaea L. cv. Cornicabra) with regard to fruit ripening and irrigation management","16968073.0","This study investigated the effect of both the degree of ripening of the olive fruit and irrigation management-rain-fed, two different regulated deficit irrigations (RDI), the method proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (known as FAO), and 125 FAO (125% FAO)-on the phenolic and volatile composition of Cornicabra virgin olive oils obtained during two crop seasons. Secoiridoid phenolic derivatives greatly decreased upon increase of both irrigation and ripening, for example, the 3,4-DHPEA-EDA content decreased from 770 to 450 mg/kg through fruit ripening under rain-fed conditions and from 676 to 388 mg/kg from rain-fed conditions to FAO irrigation treatment (at a ripeness index of approximately 4). Moreover, secoiridoid derivatives of hydroxytyrosol decreased more than those of tyrosol. The levels of major volatile components decreased in the course of ripening but were higher in irrigated olive oils: for example, the E-2-hexenal content ranged between 4.2 and 2.6 mg/kg (expressed as 4-methyl-2-pentanol) over fruit maturation under rain-fed conditions and between 8.0 and 3.5 mg/kg under FAO scheduling. It is important to note that where water was applied only from the beginning of August (RDI-2), when oil begins to accumulate in the fruit, the resulting virgin olive oil presented a phenol and volatile profile similar to those of the FAO and 125 FAO methods, but with a considerable reduction in the amount of water supplied to the olive orchard.","410.0"
"Effect of cultivar and ripening on minor components in Spanish olive fruits and their corresponding virgin olive oils","","Phenolics and volatiles are the compounds mainly responsible for the desirable flavour of extra virgin olive oils and therefore to a large extent determine the degree of consumer preference for this highly regarded product. The effect of both (i) the nature of the cultivar and (ii) the degree of ripening of the olive fruit on the biophenolic and volatile profiles of six different Spanish varieties (Arbequina, Cornicabra, Morisca, Picolimón, Picudo and Picual) and their corresponding virgin olive oils was determined in this study. A clear and statistically significant difference was observed for the oleuropein content, the main phenolic component found in the olive varieties studied. Demethyloleuropein was only found in the Arbequina variety and its content doubled during the ripening process. Verbascoside steadily increased throughout fruit maturation and cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside was the most abundant anthocyanin in all the varieties studied. Within the same cultivar a relationship between the oleosides content in the fruit and the presence of secoiridoids in the virgin olive oils was observed; however, the ratio between biophenols content in the olive fruit and in the virgin olive oil varied significantly for each of the cultivars studied (ranging from 2.3 for Picudo and 28 for Picolimon). The major volatile component was the C6 aldehyde fraction whose content varied greatly between the different varieties studied: E-2-hexenal content ranged from 20.5 mg of internal standard (4-methyl-2-pentanol) per kg of oil in the Arbequina variety to 3.1 mg/kg for Cornicabra; the amount of hexanal ranged from 1.75 mg/kg in Morisca to 0.70 mg/kg for Picual samples.","411.0"
"Storage affects the phenolic profiles and antioxidant activities of cherries (Prunus avium L) on human low-density lipoproteins","","Four sweet cherry cultivars (cvs), Burlat, Saco, Summit and Van, were analysed at harvest and after storage at 2 and 15 °C for 30 and 6 days respectively. Phenolic profiles in methanolic extracts of freeze-dried samples of the fresh and differently stored cherries were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Hydroxycinnamates dominated in all samples and represented 60-74% by weight of the phenols in the fresh and stored samples of the cvs Saco, Summit and Van, and 45% by weight of the phenols in the cv Burlat samples, which were richer in anthocyanins. The relative and total levels of hydroxycinnamates, anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan-3-ols varied among cultivars and during storage. Storage at 15 °C increased the phenol levels, particularly the cyanidin-3-rutinoside concentration. Cold storage induced decreased total phenol levels in the cvs Summit and Van but increased total phenol levels in the cvs Burlat and Saco. Phenolic cherry extracts inhibited low-density lipoprotein oxidation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Extracts of freshly harvested cherries exhibited significantly higher antioxidant activities than extracts of stored samples. The cv Summit samples had the highest antioxidant activity.

Neochlorogenic and p-coumaroylquinic acids were the main hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, but chlorogenic acid was also identified in all cultivars. The 3-glucoside and 3-rutinoside of cyanidin were the major anthocyanins. Peonidin and pelargonidin 3-rutinosides were the minor anthocyanins, and peonidin 3-glucoside was also present in cvs. Burlat and Van. Epicatechin was the main monomeric flavan-3-ol with catechin present in smaller amounts in all cultivars. The flavonol rutin was also detected. Cultivar Saco contained the highest amounts of phenolics [227 mg/100 g of fresh weight (fw)] and cv. Van the lowest (124 mg/100 g of fw).

"Metabolite composition of chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) upon cooking: Proximate analysis, fibre, organic acids and phenolics","","The aim of this research was to study the processing effects (roasting and boiling) on primary and secondary metabolite composition of fruits from the following chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) cultivars (cvs.) of three Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) areas in the Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro region (Portugal): PDO Terra Fria (cvs. Aveleira, Boaventura, Côta, Lamela and Trigueira), PDO Padrela (cvs. Judia, Lada, Longal and Negra) and PDO Soutos da Lapa (cvs. Longal and Martaínha). The cooking processes significantly (p <0.0001) affected primary and secondary metabolite composition of the chestnuts. Roasted chestnuts had higher protein contents, insoluble and total dietary fibre and lower fat contents whilst boiled chestnuts had lower protein, but higher fat contents. Cooking increased citric acid contents, especially in roasted chestnuts. On the other hand, raw chestnuts had higher malic acid contents than cooked chestnuts. Moreover, roasted chestnuts had significantly higher gallic acid and total phenolics contents, and boiled chestnuts had higher gallic and ellagic acids contents, when compared to raw chestnuts. The present data confirms that cooked chestnuts are a good source of organic acids and phenolics and have low fat contents, properties that are associated with positive health benefits.","414.0"
"Chlorogenic acid bioavailability largely depends on its metabolism by the gut microflora in rats","12771329.0","Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet with coffee, fruits and vegetables as its major sources. Its antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties have been well established in animal studies. However, little is known about its gut absorption and metabolism. In the present work, four groups of rats (n = 8) were fed a diet supplemented with chlorogenic, caffeic or quinic acids (250 micromol/d) or an unsupplemented diet for 8 d. Parent compounds and their metabolites were estimated in urine (24-h collection) and plasma by HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Significant differences in their levels were observed among the groups. The recovery of chlorogenic acid in urine was low (0.8%, mol/mol), and the total urinary excretion of caffeic acid liberated by hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid and its tissular methylated metabolites (ferulic and isoferulic acids) did not account for >0.5% (mol/mol) of the dose ingested. On the other hand, the metabolites of microbial origin, namely, m-coumaric acid and derivatives of phenylpropionic, benzoic and hippuric acids, represented the major compounds in both urine and plasma. Hippuric acid largely originated from the transformation of the quinic acid moiety, and all other metabolites from the caffeic acid moiety. These microbial metabolites accounted for 57.4% (mol/mol) of the chlorogenic acid intake. Such a high abundance of microbial metabolites shows that the bioavailability of chlorogenic acid depends largely on its metabolism by the gut microflora. Their potential importance in explaining the biological effects of dietary polyphenols is emphasized.","415.0"

In rats fed procyanidins, neither parent compound nor catechin derivatives could be detected in contrast to animals fed catechin monomer, which excreted large amounts of catechin and its 3'-O-methylated form (25.7 +/- 0.6%). On the other hand, 16 metabolites of microbial origin were detected and identified as phenylvaleric, phenylpropionic, phenylacetic, and benzoic acid derivatives. Their total yields significantly decreased from the catechin monomer (10.6 +/- 1.1%) to the procyanidin dimer (6.5 +/- 0.2%), trimer (0.7 +/- 0.1%), and polymer (0.5 +/- 0.1%). Therefore, the degree of procyanidin polymerization has a major impact on their fate in the body characterized by a poor absorption through the gut barrier and a limited metabolism by the intestinal microflora as compared to catechin. This will have to be considered to explain the health effects of procyanidins. The contribution of their microbial metabolites should also be further investigated.","416.0"
"Microbial aromatic acid metabolites formed in the gut account for a major fraction of the polyphenols excreted in urine of rats fed red wine polyphenols","12566484.0","The health effects of dietary polyphenols might be explained by both intact compounds and their metabolites formed either in the tissues or in the colon by the microflora. The quantitative importance and biological activities of the microbial metabolites have seldom been examined in vivo. We measured the microbial metabolites formed in four groups of rats (n = 8) fed for 8 d a diet supplemented with 0.12 g/100 g catechin, 0.25 or 0.50 g/100 g red wine powder containing proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids, flavanols, anthocyanins and flavonols or an unsupplemented diet. Fourteen aromatic acid metabolites were assayed in urine collected for 24 h by an HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS)-MS method. The three main metabolites formed from the catechin diet were 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid. Their total urinary excretion accounted for 4.7 g/100 g of the catechin ingested and that of intact catechins for 45.3 g/100 g. For wine polyphenols, the same microbial metabolites as observed for the catechin diet were identified in urine along with hippuric, p-coumaric, vanillic, 4-hydroxybenzoic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids. All together, these aromatic acids accounted for 9.2 g/100 g of the total wine polyphenols ingested and intact catechins for only 1.2 g/100 g. The higher excretion of aromatic acids by rats fed wine polyphenols is likely due to their poor absorption in the proximal part of the gut. Some of the microbial metabolites still bear a reducing phenolic group and should also prevent oxidative stress in inner tissues. More attention should be given in the future to these microbial metabolites and their biological properties to help explain the health effects of polyphenols that are not easily absorbed through the gut barrier.","417.0"
"Relation between bioactive compounds and free radical-scavenging capacity in berry fruits during frozen storage","","In this work the correlation between the free radical-scavenging capacity and bioactive compounds (anthocyanins, ellagic acid, total phenolics and vitamin C) in four Spanish raspberry cultivars (Heritage, Autumn Bliss, Zeva and Rubi) and Spanish wild blackberry as affected by freezing and frozen storage was evaluated. From this mathematical study a significant correlation was obtained between the radical-scavenging capacity and the anthocyanin and total phenolic contents in both raspberry (r = 0.85 and 0.83 respectively) and blackberry (r = 0.84 and 0.68 respectively) fruits, but no correlation was found between this parameter and the ellagic acid and vitamin C contents. A key objective of this study was to select the raspberry cultivar most suitable for freezing preservation in terms of the stability of its health-promoting constituents. A two-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) of the raspberry cultivars explained 82% of the total variance of the factors mentioned above. The early raspberry cultivars (Heritage and Autumn Bliss) showed a lower content of bioactive compounds and lower radical-scavenging capacity, while the late cultivars (Zeva and Rubi) showed higher values, and these differences were clearly displayed by the PCA.","418.0"
"Bioavailability of Anthocyanins and Ellagitannins Following Consumption of Raspberries by Healthy Humans and Subjects with an Ileostomy","20218618.0","The fate of anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and ellagitannins was studied following the consumption of 300 g of raspberries by healthy human volunteers and subjects with an ileostomy. Postingestion plasma and urine from the former and ileal fluid and urine from the latter group were collected and analyzed by HPLC-PDA-MS(2). Plasma from the healthy volunteers did not contain detectable quantities of either the native raspberry polyphenolics or their metabolites. The three main raspberry anthocyanins were excreted in urine in both healthy and ileostomy volunteers 0-7 h after ingestion, in quantities corresponding to <0.1% of intake. This indicates a low level of absorption in the small intestine. With ileostomy volunteers 40% of anthocyanins and 23% of the ellagitannin sanguiin H-6 were recovered in ileal fluid with the main excretion period being the first 4 h after raspberry consumption. The recovery of ellagic acid in ileal fluid was 241%, indicating hydrolysis of ellagitannins in the stomach and/or the small intestine. Urinary excretion of ellagic acid and an ellagic acid-O-glucuronide was <1% of intake. No intact or conjugated forms of ellagitannins were detected in urine from either healthy subjects or ileostomy volunteers. However, in healthy subjects, but not the ileostomists, ellagitannins were catabolized with the appearance of urolithin A-O-glucuronide, two of its isomers, and urolithin B-O-glucuronide in urine collected 7-48 h after raspberry consumption. There was marked variation in the urolithin profile of individual volunteers, indicating differences in the colonic microflora responsible for ellagitannin degradation.","419.0"
"[Anthocyanic composition of Tannat, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot young red wines from Uruguay.]","","Targeted and untargeted determinations are being currently applied to different classes of natural phenolics to develop an integrated approach aimed at ensuring compliance to regulatory prescriptions related to specific quality parameters of wine production. The regulations are particularly severe for wine and include various aspects of the viticulture practices and winemaking techniques. Nevertheless, the use of phenolic profiles for quality control is still fragmented and incomplete, even if they are a promising tool for quality evaluation. Only a few methods have been already validated and widely applied, and an integrated approach is in fact still missing because of the complex dependence of the chemical profile of wine on many viticultural and enological factors, which have not been clarified yet. For example, there is a lack of studies about the phenolic composition in relation to the wine authenticity of white and especially rosé wines. This review is a bibliographic account on the approaches based on phenolic species that have been developed for the evaluation of wine quality and frauds, from the grape varieties (of <i>V. vinifera</i> and non <i>vinifera</i>), to the geographical origin, the vintage year, the winemaking process, and wine aging. Future perspectives on the role of phenolic compounds in different wine quality aspects, which should be still exploited, are also outlined.","420.0"

The goal of this study was to measure the total polyphenol and dietary fiber contents of some tropical fruits (i.e., pineapple, wax apple, rambutan, lichi, guava, and mango) and compare the results to the content of these substances in the better characterized persimmon. It was found that lichi, guava, and ripe mango (cv. Keaw) have 3.35, 4.95, and 6.25 mg of total polyphenols in 100 g fresh fruit, respectively. This is significantly higher than in persimmon, pineapple, wax apple, mature green mango, and rambutan [P < 0.0005 for pineapple (Smooth Cayene variant), wax apple, persimmon, rambutan, mature green mango (cv. Keaw); the value of P < 0.001 is found only for pineapple (Phuket, Queen variant)]. The same relationship was observed for the contents of gallic acid and of dietary fiber.

"Comparison of some biochemical characteristics of different citrus fruits","","Postharvest anthracnose of citrus, caused by the fungus <i>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i>, leads to significant economic losses. There is a growing need for effective biological control agents to manage this disease. In this study, a bacterial strain (T226) with antagonistic potential was isolated from sugarcane rhizosphere soil. It was identified as <i>Lysobacter enzymogenes</i> through a polyphasic approach, encompassing 16S rDNA phylogenetic analysis (with 100% bootstrap support), morphological observation, and physiological and biochemical characterization. Strain T226 demonstrated strong and stable antagonistic activity against <i>C. gloeosporioides</i>. Its efficacy remained consistent over eight continuous subcultures on artificial media, indicating high metabolic stability. <i>In vivo</i> biocontrol assays confirmed its potency. Specifically, artificial stab inoculation tests showed a disease control efficacy of 78.2%, while under conditions of natural infection, T226 achieved control efficacies of 61.3% at 20 and 60 days post-application. To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying <i>Lysobacter enzymogenes</i> as a highly effective biocontrol agent against citrus postharvest anthracnose.

"Antioxidant composition and activity of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and malt extracts and of isolated phenolic compounds","","Phenolics have been identified and quantified in nine varieties of barley and their corresponding malts as flavan-3-ols, flavonols, phenolic acids and apolar esters. Flavan-3-ols are monomers, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, and polymers constituted mainly by units of (+)-catechin and (+)-gallocatechin. The most abundant compounds were the dimers procyanidin B3 and prodelphinidin B3. The main trimeric procyanidin was procyanidin C2. After malting, the phenolic content decreased for all varieties. Catechin monomers were the most affected. Beside polyphenols, barley and malt extracts contained other antioxidants: carotenoids (1utein and zeaxanthin) and tocopherols (alpha, delta and gamma). The antioxidant activity was measured using three methods: capacity to react with DPPH (ARP), inhibition of lipoxygenase activity (LoxI) and inhibition of cooxidation of beta-carotene in a linoleate model system (AOP). The inhibition of cooxidation of beta-carotene in a linoleate model system did not allow varieties to be discriminated. They all have high antioxidative properties. Using this assay, tocopherols were the best antioxidants. The ARP (antiradical power) was correlated positively with the amount of total flavan-3-ols (r = 0.89) and increased with the degree of polymerisation. The LoxI assay allowed discrimination of the nine varieties of barley and their corresponding malts but was not correlated with any compound, although flavan-3-ols were good inhibitors of lipoxygenase activity.","430.0"
"Disposition and metabolism of [2-14C]quercetin-4'-glucoside in rats","15833931.0","Quercetin-4'-glucoside is a major flavonol in onions, and this study investigated the absorption and fate of radiolabeled quercetin-4'-glucoside in rats. Rats ingested [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside and the distribution of radioactivity throughout the body was determined after 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h. The gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and plasma were extracted, and radiolabeled components were identified and quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line radioactivity detection and tandem mass spectrometry. Two hours after dosing, all the [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside had been metabolized. More than 85% of the ingested radioactivity was present in the gastrointestinal tract at all time points with approximately 6% being absorbed and present in blood and internal organs, primarily the liver and kidneys. More than 95% of the absorbed radioactivity was in the form of >20 different methylated glucuronated and/or sulfated quercetin conjugates. Five hours after ingestion, the main radiolabeled metabolites were quercetin diglucuronides in the gut, liver, and kidneys and glucuronyl sulfates of methylated quercetin in plasma.

In this study, pre- and postabsorptive metabolism of orally ingested quercetin was examined by comparing the metabolite pattern in gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, contents, and internal tissues. F344 rats (n = 6) were fed for 6 wk a diet containing 0.45% quercetin and the metabolite patterns were determined in the tissues and contents of stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon and in liver, kidney, and plasma using LC-MS/MS. GI contents contained predominantly unmetabolized quercetin at 94-100%, whereas quercetin in GI tissues was present as 11 different sulfated, glucuronated, and methylated metabolites at 32% in stomach, 88% in small intestine, 27% in cecum, and 46% in colon. Quercetin was further metabolized postabsorption and found in liver, kidney, and plasma almost exclusively as sulfated methyl-quercetin glucuronide. The unique pattern of quercetin metabolites in each GI tissue indicates extensive biotransformation before absorption and distribution in rats.","432.0"
"Characterization of lemon juice on the basis of flavonoid content","","The global citrus industry generates millions of tons of citrus processing waste (CPW), composed primarily of peel, pulp, and seeds. This agro-industrial byproduct represents both an environmental challenge and a valuable feedstock for sustainable nanotechnology. This review explores green synthesis approaches for transforming CPW, rich in bioactive compounds such as flavonoids, essential oils, and pectin, into high-performance bionanomaterials. Emphasis is placed on their biomedical applications, including antimicrobial formulations, wound healing agents, and nanocarriers for drug delivery, as well as their use in environmental remediation and catalysis. In contrast to earlier reviews, this work highlights recent progress in eco-friendly synthesis techniques (<i>e.g.</i>, microwave-assisted, biological, and hydrothermal methods) while addressing challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and bioavailability. The review also frames CPW valorization within the broader context of circular economy models and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

"Chemical composition, antioxidant capacity and functionality of raw and processed Phaseolus lunatus","","The nutrients, non-nutritional components and bioactive compounds, as well as the antioxidant capacity of raw, cooked, tray and drum-dried Phaseolus lunatus have been quantified. Likewise, the minerals, soluble carbohydrates, total polyphenols and tannins in the soaking and cooking waters were quantified. In addition, the functional properties such as the water and oil absorption indexes and the emulsifying and the foaming capacities were studied. The protein content of the raw beans was 24.98% and decreased, like calcium, magnesium and potassium, with the soaking and cooking processes; these losses are found in the soaking and cooking waters. Drum drying decreased anti-nutritional factors like trypsin inhibitors (66.09%) and cyanhydric acid (50.36%). Similarly, soluble fiber, available starch, total starch, and soluble sugars diminished, while total and insoluble fiber and resistant starch increased. The content of total polyphenols, tannins and antioxidant capacity decreased with thermal processing, being drum drying the process that least diminished antioxidant capacity. Likewise, the water absorption index was increased by 85% and 161.5% with processing. It was shown that P. lunatus is an important source of nutrients and can be consumed in whole bean form or used as a functional ingredient to be added in the development of new products.","434.0"

"Effect of processing treatments on nutritional and antinutritional contents of green gram microwave cooking and other traditional cooking methods","","High-yielding varieties of green gram (Vigna radiata L.), namely Asha and MH1K-25 contained a significant amount of antinutrients. Various processing and cooking methods, namely soaking, dehulling, ordinary cooking, pressure cooking and sprouting, decreased the level of antinutrients and improved in vitro digestibility of protein and in vitro availability of calcium, iron and zinc observed. The beneficial effect was more pronounced with pressure-cooked and soaked seeds followed by ordinary cooking, sprouting (24 h), dehulling and soaking in both cultivars. A significant increase in in vitro protein digestibility (34-35%), in vitro availability of Ca (59-61%), Fe (52-56%) and Zn (62-67%) may be ascribed to the reduced content of phytic acid (35-39%), polyphenols (41-42%) and trypsin inhibitor activity (69-70%).

"The quantitation of metabolites of quercetin flavonols in human urine","8877063.0","The flavonoid quercetin, or its metabolites, inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in rodents and may have a role in the prevention of human cancers. Quercetin exposure in human populations results from the dietary intake of various plant foods; high concentrations of quercetin are found in apples, onions, tea, and red wine. Determination of the relationship between dietary intake and cancer risk depends on the characterization of quercetin intake. The development and use of biomarkers for quercetin intake may provide a basis for the objective classification of this exposure. One possible biomarker is metabolic products of quercetin. We report the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based assay for quantitation of quercetin metabolites in human urine. The metabolites include 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (homoprotocatechuic acid), metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (homovanillic acid). The assay has only two major steps, ether extraction and HPLC analysis, and is suitable for analysis of large sample numbers. Analytical characteristics of the assay include a sensitivity of less than 1 microgram, precision with coefficients of variation < 10%, and metabolite recoveries > 90%. The mean concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, metahydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid in two human urine samples are approximately 0.7, 4.8, and 2.8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The identification of each metabolite is confirmed by HPLC, UV absorbance scans, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. These results verify the occurrence of quercetin metabolites in human urine and the feasibility of quercetin metabolite quantitation, by the assay described herein, for epidemiological studies. Development of the analytical procedure is an essential first step for validation of the metabolites as biomarkers of quercetin intake.","437.0"
"GC-MS methods for metabolic profiling of microbial fermentation products of dietary polyphenols in human and in vitro intervention studies","18502705.0","Flavonoids, a subclass of polyphenols, are major constituents of many plant-based foods and beverages, including tea, wine and chocolate. Epidemiological studies have shown that a flavonoid-rich diet is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. The majority of the flavonoids survive intact until they reach the colon where they are then extensively metabolized into smaller fragments. Here, we describe the development of GC-MS-based methods for the profiling of phenolic microbial fermentation products in urine, plasma, and fecal water. Furthermore, the methods are applicable for profiling products obtained from in vitro batch culture fermentation models. The methods incorporate enzymatic deconjugation, liquid-liquid extraction, derivatization, and subsequent analysis by GC-MS. At the level of individual compounds, the methods gave recoveries better than 80% with inter-day precision being better than 20%, depending on the matrix. Limits of detection were below 0.1 microg/ml for most phenolic acids. The newly developed methods were successfully applied to samples from human and in-vitro intervention trials, studying the metabolic impact of flavonoid intake. In conclusion, the methods presented are robust and generally applicable to diverse biological fluids. Its profiling character is useful to investigate on a large scale the gut microbiome-mediated bioavailability of flavonoids.","438.0"

On the bases of our data and those from the USDA's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) of 1994-1996, the mean daily intake of PAs in the U.S. population (>2 y old) was estimated to be 57.7 mg/person. Monomers, dimers, trimers, and those above trimers contribute 7.1, 11.2, 7.8, and 73.9% of total PAs, respectively. The major sources of PAs in the American diet are apples (32.0%), followed by chocolate (17.9%) and grapes (17.8%). The 2- to 5-y-old age group (68.2 mg/person) and men >60 y old (70.8 mg/person) consume more PAs daily than other groups because they consume more fruit. The daily intake of PAs for 4- to 6-mo-old and 6- to 10-mo-old infants was estimated to be 1.3 mg and 26.9 mg, respectively, based on the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

"Procyanidin and catechin contents and antioxidant capacity of cocoa and chocolate products","16719534.0","Cocoa and chocolate products from major brands were analyzed blind for total antioxidant capacity (AOC) (lipophilic and hydrophilic ORAC(FL)), catechins, and procyanidins (monomer through polymers). Accuracy of analyses was ascertained by comparing analyses on a NIST standard reference chocolate with NIST certified values. Procyanidin (PC) content was related to the nonfat cocoa solid (NFCS) content. The natural cocoa powders (average 87% of NFCS) contained the highest levels of AOC (826 +/- 103 micromol of TE/g) and PCs (40.8 +/- 8.3 mg/g). Alkalized cocoa (Dutched powders, average 80% NFCS) contained lower AOC (402 +/- 6 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (8.9 +/- 2.7 mg/g). Unsweetened chocolates or chocolate liquor (50% NFCS) contained 496 +/- 40 micromol of TE /g of AOC and 22.3 +/- 2.9 mg/g of PCs. Milk chocolates, which contain the least amount of NFCS (7.1%), had the lowest concentrations of AOC (80 +/- 10 micromol of TE /g) and PCs (2.7 +/- 0.5 mg/g). One serving of cocoa (5 g) or chocolate (15 or 40 g, depending upon the type of chocolate) provides 2000-9100 micromol of TE of AOC and 45-517 mg of PCs, amounts that exceed the amount in a serving of the majority of foods consumed in America. The monomers through trimers, which are thought to be directly bioavailable, contributed 30% of the total PCs in chocolates. Hydrophilic antioxidant capacity contributed >90% of AOC in all products. The correlation coefficient between AOC and PCs in chocolates was 0.92, suggesting that PCs are the dominant antioxidants in cocoa and chocolates. These results indicate that NFCS is correlated with AOC and PC in cocoa and chocolate products. Alkalizing dramatically decreased both the procyanidin content and antioxidant capacity, although not to the same extent.","441.0"

"Polyphenols in olive oil","","The Mediterranean diet is well known for its role in promoting healthy aging and reducing the risk of chronic diseases, with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) recognized as a key contributor to these benefits. Among EVOO's constituents, minor phenolic compounds have emerged as principal mediators of its biological activity. Given the pivotal role of amyloid aggregation in protein misfolding disorders (PMDs), considerable research over the past two decades has focused on amyloidogenic proteins and the discovery of natural compounds capable of modulating their aggregation. This review summarizes current evidence on the anti-amyloidogenic properties of olive-derived polyphenols, emphasizing their mechanisms of action and therapeutic relevance in two major neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

"Quantitative analysis of plasma caffeic and ferulic acid equivalents by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry","19879819.0","A validated method was developed for the simultaneous determination of the hydroxycinnamates caffeic acid (CA), dihydrocaffeic acid (DHCA), ferulic acid (FA), dihydroferulic acid (DHFA), and isoferulic acid (IFA) in human plasma as metabolites derived from coffee consumption. The method includes a protein precipitation step prior to enzymatic hydrolysis of the conjugated metabolites (sulfate, glucuronide, and/or ester) back to their aglycone forms. After liquid-liquid extraction, the reconstituted extract was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to negative electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were constructed from spiked human plasma samples in the range of 0-4800 nM for each of the targeted analytes. Two internal standards, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid (500 nM) and 1,3-dicaffeoylquinic acid (200 nM), were spiked at the beginning of the sample preparation and before analysis, respectively. Good performance data were obtained with limits of detection and quantification of the five hydroxycinnamates ranging between 1-15 nM and 3-50 nM, respectively. Within and between-days precisions were respectively calculated between 8-18% and 8-30% (at 50 nM added initially), between 6-9% and 6-12% (at 200 nM), and between 5-9% and 5-9% (at 500 nM). Precision calculated from different analysts ranged from 18% to 44% (at 50 nM), from 8% to 16% (at 200 nM), and from 4% to 8% (at 500 nM). Using this method, we determined plasma levels in humans and measured the efficiency of deconjugation using our enzymatic cocktail.","445.0"
"Reversed-phase HPLC following thiolysis for quantitative estimation and characterization of the four main classes of phenolic compounds in different tissue zones of a french cider apple variety (Malus","","Phenolic compounds, which are present in the epidermis zone, parenchyma zone, core zone, and seeds of fruit (Malus domestica var. Kermerrien), were extracted from freeze-dried material by three successive solvent extractions. The dry methanol extract and the dry aqueous acetone extracts were analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC coupled with diode array detection following thiolysis to quantify phenolic compounds according to their classes (hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, and dihydrochalcones). The method is suitable for the determination of the relative proportions of the different classes of polyphenols and provided information on the constitutive units and the average degree of polymerization of oligomeric and polymeric procyanidin structures. Results showed that procyanidins are the predominant phenolic constituents in cider apple fruits, much of them corresponding to highly polymerized structures.","446.0"
"Procyanidins are the most Abundant Polyphenols in Dessert Apples at Maturity","","Cider quality is influenced by numerous factors relating to the apples used during production. While extensive research has been done to explore the phenolic content, sensory quality, and storage stability of various apple products, the domain of fermented apple products, such as ciders, remains underrepresented. Red-fleshed apples (RFAs) have naturally high concentrations of phenolic compounds, which indicate their potential in the production of novel cider products. However, a knowledge gap remains regarding the application of RFAs in cider production and how their physicochemical and sensory properties are changed during processing. This review is the first to comprehensively investigate whether and to what extent apple categories (dessert, cider, and RFAs) differ regarding their physicochemical and sensory properties from harvest throughout cider processing. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of a holistic understanding of apple characteristics, encompassing both traditional and RFA varieties in the context of cider production. The findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders aiming to enhance product quality, providing a foundation for future studies on optimizing processing methods for a diverse and appealing range of ciders.","447.0"
"Variability of the polyphenolic composition of cider apple (Malus domestica) fruits and juices","14518950.0","Five French cider apple varieties were compared on the basis of their detailed polyphenol profile in the cortex and in the juices. Among the factors studied, variety was the most important variability factor in fruits, whereas polyphenol profiles showed an overall stability from one year to another, and a limited decrease of polyphenol concentration was observed during the starch regression period of fruit maturation. In juices, procyanidins remained the preponderant polyphenol class with concentrations up to 2.4 g/L even in centrifuged juices. Compared to the fruits, the average degree of polymerization of procyanidins was significantly reduced in the juice. Centrifugation of the crude juice had only minor effects on the polyphenol composition. For one variety, highly polymerized procyanidins with average degrees of polymerization of 25 were shown to be soluble in the centrifuged juice at a concentration of close to 1.2 g/L. Oxygenation of the juices during processing resulted in a significant decrease of all classes of native polyphenols. Catechins and procyanidins were particularly affected by oxidation, whereas caffeoylquinic acid was partly preserved. The transfer of polyphenols after pressing was maximal for dihydrochalcones and minimal for procyanidins with extraction yield values close to 80 and 30%, respectively.","448.0"
"Relationship between theoretical and experimentally detected tannin content of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)","","The small red bean, Vigna angularis, is primarily used to produce the ""an-paste"" component of Japanese sweets. Through the manufacturing process, the red seed-coat pigment is transferred to the colorless ""an-particles"", imparting a purple color. However, the major pigment in the seed coat has not yet been identified, although it is historically presumed to be an anthocyanin. Here, we report the isolation and structural determination of two hydrophobic purple pigments in the seed coat via instrumental analysis and derivatization. The new pigments, catechinopyranocyanidins A and B, contain a novel pyranoanthocyanidin skeleton condensed with a catechin and cyanidin ring system, and no sugar moieties. Catechinopyranocyanidins A and B are diastereomers with a different configuration at the catechin moiety, and both are purple in color in strongly acidic-to-neutral media. Catechinopyranocyanidins A and B are very stable under dark conditions, but, labile to light and decompose to colorless compounds. Thus, these pigments exhibit quite different chemical properties compared to simple anthocyanidins.","449.0"
"Effect of cold storage and harvest date on bioactive compounds in curly kale (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala)","","<h4>Background</h4>Iodine is one of the essential trace elements for human life. The main objective of the biofortification of plants with iodine is to obtain food with a higher content of this element compared to conventional food. Biofortification of plants with iodine can increase the intake of this trace element by different populations. In addition, it may reduce the risk of iodine deficiency diseases.<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of kale biofortified with 8-hydroxy-7-iodo-5-quinolinesulfonic acid (8-OH-7-I-5QSA) on iodine bioavailability and biochemical effects in Wistar rats.<h4>Methods</h4>Kale biofortified with (8-OH-7-I-5QSA) was tested for iodine levels in urine, feces, and selected tissues using the ICP-MS/MS technique. The feeding experiment was designed to investigate potential changes in selected thyroid-regulated biochemical parameters in blood serum of Wistar rats.<h4>Results</h4>The dietary intake of Wistar rats fed kale biofortified with (8-OH-7-I-5QSA) from both the ""Oldenbor F<sub>1</sub>"" and ""Redbor F<sub>1</sub>"" cultivars for 8 weeks resulted in significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) higher iodine concentrations in the urine and kidneys of rats, which proves iodine bioavailability. Rats' diets with ""Oldenbor F<sub>1</sub>"" and ""Redbor F<sub>1</sub>"" kale non- and -biofortified with 8-OH-7-I-5QSA had a significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) lower or a tendency for lower concentration of TSH, triglyceride, total and direct bilirubin, TBARs, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations in serum. Dietary intake of ""Oldenbor F<sub>1</sub>"" and ""Redbor F<sub>1</sub>"" kale biofortified with 8-OH-7-I-5QSA significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) increased the total antioxidant status (TAS).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study confirms that kale biofortified with iodine in organic form iodoquinoline 8-OH-7-I-5QSA is bioavailable and well absorbed by the Wistar rat and has a positive effect on selected biochemical parameters. The results obtained in this study may be highly predictive for further studies in humans.","450.0"
"Processing and storage effects on monomeric anthocyanins, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity of processed blackberry products","18211025.0","Blackberries are a rich source of polyphenolics, particularly anthocyanins, that may contribute to the reduced risk of chronic disease; however, as with most berries, the fresh fruit are only seasonally available. With most of the blackberries consumed as frozen or in thermally processed forms after long-term storage, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of processing and 6 months of storage on the anthocyanins and antioxidant capacity of blackberries that were individually quick-frozen (IQF), canned-in-syrup, canned-in-water, pureed, and juiced (clarified and nonclarified). Monomeric anthocyanins, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC FL) and photochemiluminescence (PCL) were determined postprocessing (1 day) and after 1, 3, and 6 months of storage. Processing resulted in increases in polymeric color values (up to 7%) and losses in monomeric anthocyanins (up to 65%). For most products, processing also resulted in losses in antioxidant capacity (by ORAC FL and PCL). Storage at 25 degrees C of all processed products resulted in dramatic losses in monomeric anthocyanins with as much as 75% losses of anthocyanins throughout storage, which coincided with marked increases of percent polymeric color values of these products over 6 months of storage. There were no changes in ORAC FL or PCL for processed products throughout long-term storage. No significant changes in antioxidant capacity or anthocyanin content were observed in IQF fruit during long-term storage at -20 degrees C.","451.0"

Canning, pureeing, and freezing had little effect on ellagitannins, but processing berries into nonclarified and clarified juices resulted in total ellagitannin losses of 70 and 82%, respectively, due to removal of ellagitannin-rich seeds in the presscake. Minimal changes in total ellagitannin content were observed during storage of thermally processed products, but compositional changes indicative of ellagitannin depolymerization were apparent. The ellagitannin content and composition of frozen berries remained stable over 6 months of storage. Ellagitannins are well retained in canned, pureed, and frozen blackberries, but methods are needed to prevent losses during juice processing and/or exploit the ellagitannin-rich coproducts.","452.0"

HPLC-mass spectrometry was used for identification. In addition, steryl ferulates of some selected milling byproducts were determined. The total steryl ferulate contents of rye and wheat grains were 6.0 and 6.3 mg/100 g, respectively. Uneven distribution of steryl ferulates in the grains led to considerable differences in the milling products; their steryl ferulate contents ranged from trace amounts in flours with low ash content to 20 and 34 mg/100 g in rye and wheat brans, respectively. Campestanyl ferulate and sitostanyl ferulate were the main components, followed by campesteryl ferulate and sitosteryl ferulate, whereas sitosterol was the main component in total sterols. Among the other samples, a byproduct of rice milling (pearling dust) was the best source of steryl ferulates, its total steryl ferulate content being 119 mg/100 g, whereas no measurable amounts of steryl ferulates were measured in oat bran or pearling dust of barley.

The genus <i>Fragaria</i> L. is notable for its high content of diverse classes of biologically active compounds, which exhibit a broad spectrum of pharmacological and physiological activities. This review focuses on two <i>Fragaria</i> species native to the flora of Kazakhstan: <i>F. vesca</i> L. and <i>F. viridis</i> Weston. It summarizes recent advances in their botanical characterization, phytochemical profiling, extraction methodologies, and biological activities. Available evidence indicates that the phytochemical composition of extracts obtained from these species is modulated by a range of environmental and biological factors. These include habitat conditions, climate variability, chemotypic diversity, and the specific extraction protocols applied. Particular emphasis is placed on modern extraction techniques and the identification of low-molecular-weight metabolites. These include anthocyanins, volatile organic compounds, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, which contribute significantly to the observed biological effects.

"Influence of domestic processing and storage on flavonol contents in berries","11032486.0","Effects of domestic processing and storage on the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in five berries were studied using an optimized RP-HPLC method with UV and diode array detection after an acid hydrolysis of the corresponding glycosides. In fresh berries, the total content of flavonols was highest in lingonberry (169 mg/kg) and black currant (157 mg/kg), intermediate in bilberry (41 mg/kg) and strawberry (17 mg/kg), and lowest in red raspberry (9.5 mg/kg). Cooking strawberries with sugar to make jam resulted in minor losses (quercetin 15%, kaempferol 18%). During cooking of bilberries with water and sugar to make soup, 40% of quercetin was lost. Traditional preservation of crushed lingonberries in their own juice caused a considerable (40%) loss of quercetin. Only 15% of quercetin and 30% of myricetin present in unprocessed berries were retained in juices made by common domestic methods (steam-extracted black currant juice, unpasteurized lingonberry juice). Cold-pressing was superior to steam-extraction in extracting flavonols from black currants. During 9 months of storage at 20 C, quercetin content decreased markedly (40%) in bilberries and lingonberries, but not in black currants or red raspberries. Myricetin and kaempferol were more susceptible than quercetin to losses during storage.","457.0"
"Diversity in eggplant (Solanum melongena) for superoxide scavenging activity, total phenolics, and ascorbic acid","","Eggplant is a nutritionally rich crop that has beneficial effects on human health. Wide diversity exists in eggplant in terms of biochemical content; however, extensive research work has not been undertaken to gain more in-depth knowledge on its antioxidant capacity to improve the quality of the existing popular cultivated varieties and develop/identify nutrient-rich germplasms. Therefore, a total of 57 genotypes were chosen for the study, and they were evaluated for various biochemical compounds. The biochemical traits taken were an average of three replications and these values were used for statistical analysis. The analysis of variance for five fruit quality parameters indicated a high variability among the eggplant genotypes, which signifies that at least one of the genotypes is statistically different from the rest. The total phenolics ranged from 39.63 to 312.65 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g with the highest being observed in Pusa Krishna. The flavonoid content ranged from 7.83 to 65.09 mg/100 g FW.

"Isolation and chemical characterisation of water-extractable arabinoxylans from wheat and rye during breadmaking","","Water-extractable arabinoxylans from wheat and rye flour, dough and bread were isolated and characterised by the determination of the carbohydrate composition and the ferulic acid and diferulic acid contents. For both wheat and rye, the yield of water-extractable arabinoxylans decreased during the breadmaking process, indicating that some of the water-extractable arabinoxylans had become water-insoluble, possibly by the formation of ferulic acid–protein cross-links. The determination of ferulic acid and diferulic acids showed a low degree of dimerisation (less than 1%), which did not increase during the breadmaking process. Separation of the water-extractable arabinoxylans by size-exclusion chromatography showed that the molecular mass distribution of the arabinoxylans changed during breadmaking for both wheat and rye. Dual detection by measurement of the refractive index and the UV absorbance at 310 nm enabled screening for ferulic acid in the molecular mass fractions. Water-extractable arabinoxylans from wheat contained a medium molecular mass fraction which was not UV-active.

Four characteristic components, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and coumarin were determined by RP-HPLC, and a fingerprint comprised of five markers was established. These results showed that cassia barks contained high contents of cinnamaldehyde (13.01-56.93 mg/g). The highest content of cinnamaldehyde (up to 93.83 mg/g) was found in debarked cortex, which is traditionally regarded as having the best quality in local herb shops. In contrast, the adulterants from the other Cinnamomum species, C. wilsonii Camble, C. japonicum Sieb., C. mairei Levl. and C. burmanii (Nees) Blume, contained low contents of cinnamaldehyde (<2.00 mg/g). The content of cinnamaldehyde in C. loureirii Nees was comparable to that in C. cassia.

Dealcoholized wine extracts were added to methyl linoleate (MeLo), and the oxidation in the dark at 40 degrees C was followed by conjugated diene measurement. Wines made of mixtures of black currants and crowberries or bilberries (240-275 µM GAE) were slightly superior to reference red grape wines (330-375 µM GAE) and equally as active as the control antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (50 µM), in inhibiting MeLo hydroperoxide formation. Also, raw materials including apple, arctic bramble, cowberries, cranberries, red currants, or rowanberries possessed antioxidant activity. Thus, these raw materials contain phenolic compounds, some of which are capable of protecting lipids against oxidation also in a hydrophobic lipid system. Liquors, apart from arctic bramble liquor, were less active than wines. However, the total phenolic content did not correlate with the antioxidant activity of the berry and fruit wines and liquors, therefore alleviating the importance of further characterization of the phenolic antioxidants present in berry and fruit wines.","469.0"
"Identification of isoflavone metabolites dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 6'-OH-O-dma, and cis-4-OH-equol in human urine by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy using authentic reference compounds","10527518.0","The metabolic products of daidzein and genistein, the principal isoflavones of soy, were examined. Six volunteers included soy into their normal diet for a 2-week period and urine samples were analyzed before and after soy consumption. Isolation and characterization of the urinary metabolites were carried out with absorption chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and gas chromatography-electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS). The structures of the isoflavones isolated were confirmed by using authentic reference compounds. Dihydrogenistein, 6'-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, and cis-4-OH-equol were identified, in addition to known isoflavonoids daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the known metabolites equol, O-desmethylangolensin, and dihydrodaidzein, by comparing the retention times and the spectra of the urinary compounds with those of the synthesized reference standards. The mammalian lignans enterolactone and enterodiol were also identified. Derivatization of the isoflavones for GC-MS was examined by comparing two silylating reagents, N, O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and pyridine:hexamethyldisilazan:trimethylchlorosilane (QSM), both used for the derivatization of these compounds. The silylation experiments revealed significant differences in the compositions of the derivatization products. Some corrections were made concerning the earlier published data of dihydrogenistein and 6'-OH-O-dma.","470.0"

"Studies of the in vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones aid in the identification of their urinary metabolites","15113171.0","Soy isoflavones have recently gained considerable interest due to their possible health benefits. However, detailed studies on the metabolism of isoflavones are lacking. The aims of the investigation presented here were (1) to study the in vitro intestinal metabolism of isoflavones and their hydroxylated analogues 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, 8-OH-daidzein, and 3'-OH-genistein and (2) to characterize the structures of some earlier identified urinary metabolites of soy isoflavones, for which no authentic reference compounds have been available. Isoflavone standards (1-2 mg) were fermented with human fecal flora (16.7%) for 24 h. Metabolites formed during the fermentation were tentatively identified by interpretation of the mass spectra of trimethylsilylated compounds obtained by GC-MS. Compounds having hydroxyl groups at 5-position (i.e., genistein and 3'-OH-genistein) were completely converted to metabolites that could not be detected by the methods used in this study. The metabolism of daidzein and its hydroxylated analogues, 3'-OH-daidzein, 6-OH-daidzein, and 8-OH-daidzein, occurred to a much lesser extent. Minor amounts of reduced metabolites (i.e., isoflavanones and alpha-methyldeoxybenzoins) of these compounds were tentatively identified in fermentation extracts. The retention times and the mass spectra of reduced isoflavone metabolites, obtained from in vitro fermentations of pure compounds, were utilized to identify unknown urinary metabolites of soy isoflavones. Four novel isoflavone metabolites were identified in human urine collected after soy supplementation: 3' '-OH-O-desmethylangolensin, 3',4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone, 4',7,8-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and 4',6,7-trihydroxyisoflavanone.","473.0"

"Quality and quantity of prevailing flavonoid glycosides of yellow and green french beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)","","The flavonoid composition of six varieties in either case of yellow and green French beans was investigated. Fresh beans were chopped under liquid nitrogen just after harvest and lyophilized subsequently. The flavonoids were exhaustively extracted, purified by selective adsorption to and stepwise elution from polyamide, and separated by RP-HPLC with UV detection. With one exception the qualitative chromatographic pattern of the 12 varieties was very similar. The main flavonoids were identified as 3-O-glucuronides (-3-O-glucur) and 3-O-rutinosides (-3-O-rut) of quercetin (Q) and kaempferol (K) by LC-TSP-MS comparing retention time, UV spectra, and mass spectra with those of pure flavonoids. The areas of HPLC peaks with identical aglycon were summed up and converted into the -3-O-rut of Q or K with the respective calibration curves. The total content of Q-3-O-glycosides ranged from 19.1 to 183.5 micrograms/g and that of K-3-O-glycosides from 5.6 to 14.8 micrograms/g of fresh bean, demonstrating a dependence on the variety without general difference between yellow and green representatives.","475.0"

"Strawberry consumption is associated with increased antioxidant capacity in serum","20136444.0","Strawberries are known to contain antioxidants, but the significance of ingesting antioxidant-rich fruits remains to be established. In order to determine whether the consumption of strawberries impacted measures of in vivo antioxidant capacity, frozen strawberries (250 g) were administered daily for 3 weeks to 21 healthy female volunteers. Compliance was confirmed by quantitating pelargonidin-glucuronide, urolithin A-glucuronide, and 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3-[(2)H]furanone-glucuronide in plasma and urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and antioxidant capacity in serum measured by the increase in lag phase of low-density lipoprotein after copper sulfate exposure, DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, and activity of phase II enzymes. Among these measures lipid peroxidation lag time increased by 20% (P < .01), whereas other measures did not change significantly. The potent antioxidant defenses in humans make determination of changes due to dietary ingestion in healthy individuals difficult. In summary, daily consumption of strawberries resulted in a modest but significant increase in antioxidant capacity in a healthy population.","477.0"

Oregano exhibited the highest AC among the herbs tested in dry and fresh forms. Compared with fresh herbs, the AC in dry form was decreased in garlic, chili, dill, oregano and parsley and paste form of oregano and basil. With the exception of dried garlic and lemongrass in fresh and paste form, all herbs in dry, paste, and fresh form contained significant AC. The AC was correlated significantly to the total phenolic content in both dry and fresh form. However, there was no significant correlation between the AC and the concentration of chemical marker compounds. In summary, processed herbs contribute significant amounts of AC to the diet.","478.0"
"Variations in the phenolic composition of fruit juices with different treatments","","Fruit and vegetable juices (FVJs) are widely consumed due to their rich profile of vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds, particularly antioxidants, which play a critical role in mitigating non-communicable diseases. However, conventional thermal processing methods, while effective in microbial inactivation, significantly compromise the antioxidant capacity (AC), sensory attributes, and nutritional quality of FVJs. In response to growing consumer demand for minimally processed and functionally enriched juices, non-thermal technologies (NTTs) have emerged as promising alternatives. This review comprehensively evaluates recent advancements (2015-2024) in non-thermal processing methods-including ultrasonication, cold plasma, irradiation, and pulsed electric fields-and their influence on the AC and overall quality of FVJs. NTTs enhance juice quality by inducing abiotic stress, activating antioxidant biosynthesis pathways, inactivating spoilage enzymes, and facilitating the release of bound phytochemicals. The review highlights the mechanistic insights, optimal processing parameters, and synergistic effects of combined NTT approaches on juice matrix, antioxidant retention, and enzymatic stability. Furthermore, it discusses the scalability, energy efficiency, and environmental sustainability of these technologies in comparison to traditional thermal methods. Despite promising outcomes at the laboratory scale, commercial adaptation of NTTs faces challenges such as equipment cost, process optimization for diverse juice matrices, regulatory acceptance, and consumer perception. Future directions emphasize the need for multidisciplinary collaborations to decode antioxidant metabolism, validate safety parameters (e.g., ROS/RNS residues), and develop industry-ready, cost-effective, and safe processing units. This review stands out by providing mechanistic insights, comparative efficacy, and optimization strategies of various NTTs specifically aimed at enhancing antioxidant capacity in fruit and vegetable juices. It also integrates a critical discussion on industrial scalability, regulatory challenges, and future biosynthetic pathway investigations, distinguishing it from prior reviews.","479.0"
"Determination of antioxidants in edible grain derivatives from the Canary Islands by capillary electrophoresis","","A preliminary study of the antioxidant content of hand-produced grain derivatives from the Canary Islands, named gofio, is developed by means of a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method. Protocatechuic acid, salicylic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid were extracted from corn, wheat, barley and pea gofio samples by sonication with methanol and were successfully separated by CE using a polycation, hexadimetrine bromide (HDB), as electrosmotic flow modifier. The separation was achieved using a running buffer consisting of 125 mM boric acid, 49 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 0.002% (w/v) HDB and 2.5 mM alpha-cyclodextrin at pH 7.5. The developed procedure allowed the simultaneous determination of the selected antioxidants in less than 3.5 min. The electrophoretic profile obtained for each kind of flour (corn, wheat, barley and pea) allowed differentiation of the type of gofio. Among the analyzed samples, corn gofio showed the highest antioxidant content. Furthermore, highly roasted corn or wheat gofio samples were also analyzed and their antioxidant contents were lower than those of less roasted samples.","480.0"

"Improved high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the analysis of naringin in grapefruit juice without extraction","","Phytotherapy represents a promising field for developing new therapeutic strategies, either by acting as antiparasitic agents themselves or by enhancing the efficacy of synthetic drugs. The present study evaluated the in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions following the administration of doramectin, either alone or in combination with cinnamaldehyde and pink grapefruit essential oil (CNM-PGF). Additionally, ex vivo P-glycoprotein-mediated interactions were assessed at the intestinal level. Higher efficacy against <i>Haemonchus contortus</i> was observed with the combined treatment of doramectin plus phytochemicals or loperamide. Although phytochemicals and loperamide reduced the ex vivo efflux of rhodamine 123, no pharmacokinetic interactions were detected in vivo. The enhanced efficacy is most likely attributable to localized drug-drug interactions and increased drug availability at the parasite interface. Based on the results obtained, the best treatment would be the combination of DRM with phytochemicals such as CNM-PGF and loperamide. However, a pharmaceutical formulation that allows sustained in vivo interaction between these compounds is needed.","486.0"

"Phenolic acid metabolites as biomarkers for tea- and coffee-derived polyphenol exposure in human subjects","14756917.0","Tea and coffee are rich in polyphenols with a variety of biological activities. Many of the demonstrated activities are consistent with favourable effects on the risk of chronic diseases. 4-O-methylgallic acid (4OMGA) and isoferulic acid are potential biomarkers of exposure to polyphenols derived from tea and coffee respectively. 4OMGA is derived from gallic acid in tea, and isoferulic acid is derived from chlorogenic acid in coffee. Our major objective was to explore the relationships of tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid in human subjects. The relationships of long-term usual (111 participants) and contemporaneously recorded current (344 participants) tea and coffee intake with 24 h urinary excretion of 4OMGA and isoferulic acid were assessed in two populations. 4OMGA was related to usual (r 0.50, P<0.001) and current (r 0.57, P<0.001) tea intake, and isoferulic acid was related to usual (r 0.26, P=0.008) and current (r 0.18, P<0.001) coffee intake. Overall, our present results are consistent with the proposal that 4OMGA is a good biomarker for black tea-derived polyphenol exposure, but isoferulic acid may be of limited usefulness as a biomarker for coffee-derived polyphenol exposure.","490.0"

"Buckwheat - the source of antioxidant activity in functional foods","","The incorporation of bioactive compounds from plant-based by-products into staple foods represents a sustainable strategy to enhance both nutritional quality and health benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of buckwheat husk addition (1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5%) on the antioxidant activity, total phenolic content (TPC) and its profile, color parameters, and sensory attributes of wheat and wholemeal breads. Increasing the husk content significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) enhanced antioxidant activity, especially in the lipid-soluble fraction, with the highest values observed at 4.5% addition. In terms of TPC, wheat bread showed a significant (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05) increase (16.5%) only at 3.0% husk addition, while wholemeal breads exhibited consistent TPC growth at all levels, reaching a 35.2% increase at 4.5% enrichment. Phenolic profiling revealed syringic acid as the dominant compound, constituting up to 64.4% of total phenolic acids in wholemeal bread with 4.5% husk. Flavonoids content increased with husk addition, with rutin, catechin, and orientin most prominent. Color analysis indicated a reduction in lightness and hue angle, an increase in browning index and total color difference with higher husk addition. Addition of husk modified aroma, color, and mouthfeel. Wholemeal breads with 1.5% and 4.5% buckwheat husk had the highest acceptability, enhancing nutritional and functional quality without affecting preference.

"Urinary excretion of strawberry anthocyanins is dose dependent for physiological oral doses of fresh fruit","18645999.0","There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral dose and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion (Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 units of excretion. Within individuals, dose -- excretion data fitted a linear regression model (median R(2) = 0.93). We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.","493.0"

The fragmentation patterns of flavonol metabolites obtained by MS/MS were distinctive for some isomers, indicating that fragmentation patterns may be useful predictors of conjugation position. Two isomers of sulfate quercetin glucosides were also found in urine, suggesting that many of the quercetin glucosides in onion are absorbed intact and undergo metabolism to the sulfate conjugate. Additionally, the interindividual variation in urinary quercetin metabolite profiles was determined by comparing the relative level of six different quercetin metabolites excreted in the urine of healthy volunteers. The ranges of quercetin metabolites excreted were similar among volunteers, yet notable differences in the levels of metabolites among individuals were observed. This study demonstrates the potential of monitoring the range of quercetin metabolites to reveal information on interindividual biotransformation capacity in response to dietary manipulations and as a biomarker for flavonol consumption.","495.0"

Levels of phenolic acids, capxanthin, and zeaxanthin generally increased during maturation, whereas the level of lutein declined. Flavonoid concentrations varied greatly among the pepper types analyzed and were negatively correlated to AOX under the conditions of the beta-carotene-linoleic assay. Model systems were used to aid in understanding the relationship between flavonoids and AOX. Significant increases in AOX were observed in pepper juice models in response to increasing dilution factors and the presence of EDTA, indicating a pro-oxidant effect due to metal ions in the system. In vitro models demonstrated that increasing levels of flavonoids in combination with constant levels of caffeic and ascorbic acid gave a resultant AOX that was either additive of the two compounds or competitive in their ability to scavenge peroxyl radicals. The model systems were in good agreement with the chemical composition of the pepper cultivars and reflected the interactions affecting AOX. More research is needed to understand the complex interactions that occur among various antioxidants present in pepper extracts.","497.0"
"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of spinach as affected by genetics and growing season","12358455.0","Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of 11 commercial cultivars and 15 advanced breeding lines of spinach were determined over two growing seasons known to vary in biotic and abiotic stresses. Flavonoid composition and content of fall-grown commercial cultivars and advanced breeding lines were also determined. Over-winter spinach, which was planted in late fall and harvested in the spring, had much higher levels of total phenolics and antioxidant capacity than spinach planted in early fall and harvested in late fall, indicating that growing conditions, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses, influenced phenolic metabolism. Genotype also appeared to play an important role in affecting phenolic metabolism and antioxidant capacity in spinach. Advanced breeding lines of spinach, which show increased disease resistance, had higher levels of total phenolics, individual and total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than commercial cultivars. Our results indicate that plant breeders can select for increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity in spinach cultivars, or the crops can be grown in different seasons or under certain stress conditions to elevate levels of antioxidants.","498.0"
"Jam Processing and Storage Effects on Blueberry Polyphenolics and Antioxidant Capacity","20055410.0","Fresh blueberries were processed into sugar and sugar-free jams and stored for 6 months at 4 and 25 degrees C. The jams were analyzed immediately after processing and over 6 months of storage for polyphenolic content, percent polymeric color, and antioxidant capacity. Processing resulted in losses of anthocyanins, procyanidins, chlorogenic acid, and ORAC in both jam types, but flavonols were well retained. Marked losses of anthocyanins and procyanidins occurred over 6 months of storage and were accompanied by increased polymeric color values. Chlorogenic acid levels also declined during storage, but flavonols and ORAC changed little. Jams stored at 4 degrees C retained higher levels of anthocyanins, procyanidins, and ORAC and had lower polymeric color values than jams stored at 25 degrees C. Sugar-free jams retained higher levels of anthocyanins and had lower polymeric color values than sugar jams late during storage. Blueberry jams should be refrigerated to better retain polyphenolics and antioxidant capacity.","499.0"
"Comparability and reliability of different techniques for the determination of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil","","Squalene is a bioactive compound with significant health benefits, predominantly found in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and its processing by-products. This critical review explores the analytical determination of squalene in EVOO and various by-products from olive oil production, highlighting its potential as a valuable ingredient in functional foods. An overview of existing analytical methods is provided, focusing on different approaches to sample preparation before analytical determination, evaluating their effectiveness in quantifying squalene concentrations. Studies not primarily centered on analytical methodologies or squalene quantification were excluded. A critical gap identified is the absence of an official method for squalene determination, which hinders comparability and standardization across studies, underscoring the importance of developing a reliable, standardized method to ensure accurate quantification. The valorization of squalene involves advocating for its extraction from olive oil processing by-products to enhance sustainability in the olive oil industry. By recovering squalene, the industry can not only reduce waste but also enhance functional food products with this health-promoting compound. Additionally, there is a need for economically sustainable and environmentally friendly extraction techniques that can be scaled up for industrial application, thus contributing to a circular economy within the olive oil sector.","500.0"
"Limonoids and flavonoids in juices of Oroblanco and Melogold grapefruit hybrids","","Oroblanco and Melogold are hybrids obtained from pummelo and grapefruit. Limonoids and flavonoids in both juices were analyzed. Oroblanco and Melogold juices contained low concentrations of limonoid glucosides, an average of 99 and 59 ppm, respectively. However, they contained relatively high concentrations of bitter limonoid aglycones, limonin and nomilin, at levels above the limonin bitterness threshold. For comparison, limonoid glucosides in juices of grapefruit, another pummelo hybrid, were also analyzed. Limonin glucoside was the major limonoid glucoside in all juices analyzed. Nomilin glucoside and nomilinic acid glucosides were also present. Oroblanco and Melogold juices contained bitter flavonoids normally found in grapefruit and pummelo including naringin, neohesperidin and poncerin in total amount of 440 ppm in Oroblanco juice and 495 ppm in Melogold juice.

"Determination of chlorogenic acid in coffee","","Chlorogenic acid or 5-Caffeoylquinic acid is a polyphenolic component present in coffee and its by-products. Chlorogenic acid has been shown to exert biological properties, particularly in relation to glucose and lipid metabolism, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities, among others. Due to its importance, it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of the analytical method for its determination in complex matrices such as food. In this work, different methods of chlorogenic acid extraction in coffee Silverskin were studied, as well as its quantification by HPLC. The results showed that the method of extraction with a mixture of methanol:water (3:1 v/v) in an ultrasonic bath, favored the recovery of chlorogenic acid with a recovery of 77.44%. The instrument detection limit for chlorogenic acid was 3.311 &micro;g/mL and the quantification limit was 11.037 &micro;g/mL. For coffee Silverskin, the concentration obtained of chlorogenic acid by the three extraction methods evaluated was in the range of 57 to 224 mg/kg of coffee silverskin (dry basis).","502.0"

"Flaxseed influences urinary lignan excretion in a dose-dependent manner in postmenopausal women","11045796.0","Dietary estrogens, such as lignans, are similar in structure to endogenous sex steroid hormones and may act in vivo to alter hormone metabolism and subsequent cancer risk. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dietary intake of a lignan-rich plant food (flaxseed) on urinary lignan excretion in postmenopausal women. This randomized, cross-over trial consisted of three 7-week feeding periods during which 31 healthy postmenopausal women, ages 52-82 years, consumed their habitual diets plus 0, 5, or 10 grams of ground flaxseed per day. Urine samples collected for 2 consecutive days during the last week of each feeding period were analyzed for lignan content (enterodiol, enterolactone, and matairesinol) by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Compared with the 0-gram flaxseed diet, consumption of 5 or 10 grams of flaxseed significantly increased excretion of enterodiol by 1,009 and 2,867 nmol/day, respectively; significantly increased excretion of enterolactone by 21,242 and 52,826 nmol/day, respectively; and significantly increased excretion of total lignans (enterodiol + enterolactone + matairesinol) by 24,333 and 60,640 nmol/day, respectively. Excretion of matairesinol was not significantly altered by flaxseed consumption. Consumption of flax, a significant source of dietary estrogens, in addition to their habitual diets increased excretion of enterodiol and enterolactone, but not matairesinol, in a dose-dependent manner in this group of postmenopausal women. Urinary excretion of lignan metabolites is a dose-dependent biomarker of flaxseed intake within the context of a habitual diet.","506.0"

We analyzed the effect of high-temperature pasteurization, fermentation, and milk renneting as well as storage on the stability of SDG added to milk, yogurt, and cheese. Also, the stability of SDG in whey-based drinks was studied. Added SDG was found to withstand the studied processes well. In edam cheese manufacture, most of the added SDG was retained in the whey fraction and 6% was found in the cheese curd. SDG was also relatively stable in edam cheese during ripening of 6 weeks at 9 degrees C and in yogurt during storage of 21 days at 4 degrees C. Up to 25% of added SDG was lost in whey-based drinks during storage of 6 months at 8 degrees C. We conclude that SDG can be successfully supplemented in dairy-based products.","507.0"
"Resveratrol and piceid levels in natural and blended peanut butters","11312807.0","Peanut and its derivatives, especially peanut butter, are extensively consumed in many countries, mainly in the United States, which is also the major exporter of these products. trans-Resveratrol is present in peanuts, and recently this compound has been quantified in peanut butter. It is well-known that there are beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol and its glucoside, the piceid, in health. The absorption of trans-resveratrol has been proven in animals, and certain studies show that the absorption of some phenols is enhanced by conjugation with glucose, so that it could be possible that trans-piceid would be more absorbed than its aglycon (trans-resveratrol). In our work, we have identified the presence of trans-piceid in peanut butter with a new method to quantify trans-resveratrol and trans-piceid (3-beta-glucose of trans-resveratrol). This fact is very interesting because the glucosilated form could be more easily absorbed by the intestinal gut; in this way trans-piceid would exercise its beneficial function more efficiently than trans-resveratrol. To our knowledge, this is the first time that trans-piceid has been quantified in peanut butter. Resveratrol and piceid contents in natural peanut butters were found to be significantly higher than those in blended peanut butters.","508.0"
"Absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside in rats","15630238.0","Anthocyanins, kind of flavonoids (FL) found in plants and vegetables, are known to have varieties of physiological functions. In the present study, we examined absorption and metabolism of delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (Dp3G) in rats. Dp3G appeared in the plasma at 15 min after oral administration as an intact glucosidic form. The plasma level also showed another peak at 60 min. One metabolite peak was detected in the plasma and the structure was assigned as 4'-O-methyl Dp3G (MDp3G) by NMR and MS. The metabolite was also identified in several tissues as a major metabolite especially in the liver. No 3'-O-methyl Dp3G was detected in any tissues, therefore, 4'-OH methylation is the main path of Dp3G metabolism in rats. This finding generalized the metabolic formation of FL having pyrogallol B ring because it has been reported that FL having catechol structure produced 3'-O-methyl-derivatives, but FL having pyrogallol structure produced 4'-O-methyl-derivatives.","509.0"
"Extended glucuronidation is another major path of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats","16131148.0","We previously determined that five rather hydrophobic metabolites appeared in blood plasma after oral administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, but a group of hydrophilic metabolites still remained unidentified. In the present study, 12 hydrophilic metabolites found were collected from urine and plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and then analyzed by tandem MS spectrometry. From the MS spectra, four metabolites out of 12 were assigned as glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and six out of 12 were glucuronides of the primary metabolites of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside). Extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside showed their maximum plasma concentrations at 15 and 60 min (or 30 min) after oral administration, respectively. Their maximum plasma concentrations ranged from 15 to 70 nM. From the profile of urinary-excreted anthocyanins after intravenous administration, it was deduced that extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside were mainly produced in the liver rather than by intestinal flora. The area under the plasma concentration curve was 0.25 micromol min/L for extended glucuronides of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 0.14 micromol min/L for O-methyl cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, respectively, when evaluated as cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside equivalent, indicating that extended glucuronidation is a critical pathway in cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside metabolism in rats.","510.0"
"Bioavailability and tissue distribution of anthocyanins in bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract in rats","16939312.0","To clarify how structural diversity of anthocyanins relates to their in vivo function, bioavailability was precisely studied in rats using bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract (Bilberon 25) as an anthocyanin source that contains 15 different anthocyanins. The bilberry extract was orally or intravenously administered to rats, and the plasma levels of each anthocyanin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. As the result, all anthocyanins except peonidin 3-O-alpha-L-arabinoside were detectable in the blood plasma. The plasma concentration of anthocyanins as a whole reached the maximum level of 1.2 microM at 15 min after oral administration of 400 mg/kg bilberry extract (153.2 mg/kg as anthocyanins) and then decreased with time. Uptake and decay profiles of each anthocyanin in the plasma were almost the same for all anthocyanins except a few with their maximum after 30 min. Among the anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone, the plasma level after 15 min of oral administration was as follows: galactoside > glucoside > arabinoside. Plasma clearance of anthocyanins after intravenous administration clearly showed that arabinoside disappeared more rapidly than glucoside and galactoside. On the other hand, when anthocyanins carrying the same sugar moiety were compared, the half disappearance time of plasma anthocyanins was in the following order: delphinidin > cyanidin > petunidin = peonidin > malvidin. The bioavailability of anthocyanins was in the range of 0.61-1.82% and was 0.93% as the anthocyanin mixture. The bioavailability of anthocyanins carrying the same aglycone was in the following order: Galactoside showed the highest followed by glucoside and arabinoside for cyanidin and delphinidin, but arabinoside and galactoside showed a higher bioavailability than glucoside for petunidin and malvidin. Anthocyanins recovered in urine and bile during the first 4 h after intravenous administration were only 30.8 and 13.4%, respectively. Anthocyanin profiles in tissues were quite different from those in blood plasma. The major anthocyanins distributed in liver and kidney were the O-methyl anthocyanins such as peonidin, malvidin, and other O-methyl anthocyanins derived from delphinidin, cyanidin, and petunidin-glycosides.","511.0"

"Changes in flavonoid content of grapefruit juice caused by thermal treatment and storage","","The effect of conventional and microwave pasteurization on the main flavonoids present in grapefruit juice and their stability throughout 2months of refrigerated and frozen storage was evaluated. Individual flavonoids were analyzed by HPLC. The results showed that naringin, narirutin, quercetin and naringenin were the most abundant flavonoids in grapefruit juice. In general, although every pasteurization treatment caused a significant reduction in the content of all the studied flavonoids, the treated samples were more stable during storage. While fresh squeezed juice (FS) and conventional pasteurized juice (CP) were better preserved under refrigeration conditions, microwave pasteurized juice (MP) conserved better when frozen stored. In fact, after 2months, frozen MP samples showed the greatest flavonoid retention. From this point of view, microwave treatment can be considered a good alternative to conventional pasteurization. INDUSTRIAL RELEVANCE: Flavonoids are polyphenolic compounds present in fruits and vegetables relevant not only in terms of quality, as they influence the visual appearance and taste, but also from a therapeutical point of view, as they appear to be associated with the prevention of degenerative diseases. The consumption of grapefruit juice is fairly widespread among the population. Traditionally, juices have been pasteurized by heat treatment to prolong their shelf life. However, this process may cause irreversible losses of nutritional quality and antioxidant activity and, in consequence, may affect their health-related properties. In this sense, the use of microwaves can be considered an alternative to conventional thermal pasteurization. Microwave energy was applied as alternative to conventional heating for grapefruit juice pasteurization. The results obtained in this study showed that when the effect of pasteurization process and storage is considered together, the use of microwave energy led to a greater retention of all the analyzed flavonoids, thereby representing a good alternative to conventional pasteurization. In this case, frozen storage of processed product would be recommended to better preserve these compounds.","513.0"
"Effects of cooking on the bioactivity of lotus roots and white onions","","Bioactive compounds and antioxidant potentials were determined in fresh lotus roots and subjected to boiling for different periods of time (10, 20, 40, and 60 min). The obtained results were compared with the same indices in fresh and boiled white onions. It was found that fresh vegetables contained higher quantities of bioactive compounds than those boiled for 10 min, and these indices were significantly higher in fresh white onions than in fresh lotus roots (P < 0.05). Polyphenols (mg GAE/g) were 3.65 ± 0.2ᵃ and 10.48 ± 0.5ᵇ; flavanols (μg CE/g) −44.13 ± 2.8ᵃ and 91.94 ± 4.3ᵇ; flavonoids (mg CE/g) −0.54 ± 0.02ᵃ and 1.04 ± 0.03ᵇ; anthocyanins (mg CE/kg) −20.61 ± 1.2ᵃ and 28.34 ± 1.3ᵇ; and tannins (mgCE/g) −0.58 ± 0.02ᵃ and 1.69 ± 0.03ᵇ of lotus roots and white onions, respectively. The highest antioxidant potential was registered in fresh lotus roots and fresh white onions (10.1 ± 0.70ᵃ and 15.0 ± 0.8ᵇ; 8.1 ± 0.4ᵃ and 23.05 ± 1.1ᵇ; 18.7 ± 0.9ᵃ and 26.9 ± 1.3ᵇ μM TE/g for FRAP, DPPH, and CUPRAC, respectively (P < 0.05) and 26.9 ± 1.5ᵃ and 24.14 ± 1.1ᵃ μM TE/g for ABTS (P > 0.05). The influence on tumor cell lines Calu-6 (% of cell viability) of fresh lotus roots (75.61 ± 2.03) and boiling boiled for 10 min (76.54 ± 3.14) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than for fresh white onions (94.18 ± 3.67) and 10 min (97.02 ± 4.16) white onion. By comparison, the tumor cell lines SNU-601 (% of cell viability) showed similar data for both fresh and boiled vegetables in the range of 86.45 ± 4.07 to 87.28 ± 2.42. In conclusion, the boiling led to a decrease of bioactivity; however, lotus demonstrated higher thermostability than white onions. Three-dimensional fluorescence can be used as an additional index for evaluation of properties. Fresh and boiled (for 10 min) lotus roots and white onions could be considered as a functional food with high antioxidative and antiproliferative activities.","514.0"

The polyphenolic content increased during storage in three cultivars but not in 'Murasakimasari'. The change in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity (DPPH-RSA) correlated very well with polyphenolic content. The increases in polyphenolics and the RSA in 'Benimasari' were significantly greater during storage at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. The main polyphenolic components in all cultivars were chlorogenic acid (ChA) and 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA). ChA level increased more at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C, whereas that of 3,5-diCQA was greater at 15 degrees C. Caffeoylquinic acids and RSA in 'Murasakimasari', which contains a large amount of anthocyanin in flesh tissue, were extremely high at the beginning of storage and remained nearly constant or decreased over time. A non-caffeoylquinic acid component that increased during storage, especially in 'J-Red' at 15 degrees C, was purified by successive chromatographic steps. The isolate was identified as caffeoyl sucrose [CSu, 6-O-caffeoyl-(beta- d-fructofuranosyl-(2-->1))-alpha-D-glucopyranoside] by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).

"Mass spectrometric identification and high-performance liquid chromatographic determination of a flavonoid glycoside naringin in human urine","","The aim of this study was to evaluate the absorption of a citrus flavonoid, naringin, as its glycosylated form. Six healthy volunteers (three males and three females) were studied. After a single oral administeration of 500 mg of naringin, intact naringin was isolated from 2-4 h urine. Isolated naringin was identified by the LC/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), MS/MS, and MS/MS/MS techniques. The cumulative urinary excretion of naringin and its metabolites (naringenin and naringenin glucuronides) was determined by HPLC for 0-24 h. Approximately 0.02% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as unchanged naringin, whereas urinary recoveries of naringenin and naringenin glucuronides were approximately 0.4 and 3.6% of the administered dose, respectively. It was concluded that trace amounts of orally administered naringin can be absorbed as the glycoside. However, it is not clear whether the glycoside is cleaved before or after absorption to generate naringenin.","520.0"
"Total antioxidant activity and phenolic content in selected vegetables","","This study aimed to improve postharvest preservation strategies for Welsh onion (Allium fistulosum L.) by optimizing disinfection techniques and packaging methods. This study pioneers the combination of cold plasma treatment and nanocomposite packaging as a novel approach to enhance shelf life and preserve quality in Welsh onion. The research was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, disinfection was performed using gamma irradiation (1, 3, and 5 kGy) and cold plasma (15, 20, and 25 kV for 5, 10, and 15 min). In the second phase, four gas-barrier nanocomposite films were tested under both ambient and vacuum-sealed storage conditions for 4, 8, and 12 months. Volatile compounds were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC and GC/MS). Cold plasma treatment was more effective than gamma irradiation in preserving key postharvest quality parameters. The highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity were observed in samples treated with cold plasma at 25 kV for 5 min, with a phenolic content of 196.84 mg GAE/g DW and an IC₅₀ value of 78.74 μg/mL. Nonetheless, all packaging treatments showed declines in total phenolics, essential oil yield, and L* color values over time. The major volatile compounds in the essential oil included dipropyl disulfide (9.0%-18.3%), dipropyl trisulfide (9.4%-16.4%), dimethyl trisulfide (5.3%-11.1%), diallyl disulfide (6.8%-11.4%), and d-limonene (4.0%-9.1%).

Fifteen polyphenols including mammalian lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone), several phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, m-coumaric, gallic, and 4-O-methylgallic acids), phloretin and various flavonoids (catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, and naringenin) were simultaneously quantified in human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionisation mass-MS (HPLC-electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry) with a run time of 6 min per sample. The method has been validated with regard to linearity, precision, and accuracy in intra- and inter-day assays. It was applied to urine samples collected from nine volunteers in the 24 h following consumption of either green tea, a grape-skin extract, cocoa beverage, coffee, grapefruit juice or orange juice. Levels of urinary excretion suggest that chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, epicatechin, naringenin or hesperetin could be used as specific biomarkers to evaluate the consumption of coffee, wine, tea or cocoa, and citrus juices respectively.","522.0"
"Sterol ferulates, sterols, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinols from wheat, rye, and corn bran oils and their inhibitory effects on Epstein-Barr virus activation","14582960.0","Sterol ferulate, free sterol, and 5-alk(en)ylresorcinol constituents of wheat, rye, and corn bran oils were studied. Among the sterol ferulates, one novel compound, 24-methylenecholestanol ferulate (7), along with six known compounds, namely, 24-methylcholestanol ferulate (1), 24-methylcholesterol ferulate (2), 2-methyllathosterol ferulate (3), stigmastanol ferulate (4), sitosterol ferulate (5), and schottenol ferulate (6), were isolated and characterized. Five known free sterols, namely, 24-methylcholesterol (8), stigmastanol (9), sitosterol (10), schottenol (11), and stigmasterol (12), were isolated and identified. 5-Alk(en)ylresorcinols were found in wheat and rye bran oils but not in corn bran oil. Of these, one new compound, 5-n-(2'-oxo-14'-Z-heneicosenyl) resorcinol (19), and seven known compounds, namely, 5-n-heptadecyl- (13), 5-n-nonadecyl- (14), 5-n-heneicosyl- (15), 5-n-tricosyl- (16), 5-n-pentacosyl- (17), 5-n-(14'-Z-nonadecenyl)- (18), and 5-n-(2'-oxoheneicosyl)resorcinols (20), were isolated and characterized. These compounds were evaluated with respect to their inhibitory effects on the induction of Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, which is known to be a primary screening test for antitumor promoters. Four compounds, 1, 2, 4, and 11, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction.","523.0"
"The relative contribution of the small and large intestine to the absorption and metabolism of rutin in man","17015248.0","Tomato juice containing rutin (quercetin-3-rutinoside) was ingested by healthy volunteers and ileostomists. Blood and urine collected over 24 h were analysed by HPLC with photodiode array (PDA) and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Low concentrations of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide (Cmax = 4.3 +/- 1.5 nmoles/l) and quercetin-3-glucuronide (Cmax = 12 +/- 2 nmoles/l) were detected in plasma of healthy subjects. Metabolites appeared in blood after 4 h indicating absorption from the large intestine. Nine metabolites of rutin were detected in urine but with considerable variation in total amount (40 +/- 1-4981 +/- 115 nmoles over 24 h). No metabolites were detected in plasma or urine of ileostomists and 86 +/- 3% of the ingested rutin was recovered in ileal fluid. In subjects with an intact large intestine, but not ileostomists, rutin was catabolised with the appearance of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid in urine accounting for 22% of rutin intake.","524.0"
"Kinetic evaluation of colour, texture, polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of Irish York cabbage after blanching treatment","","York cabbage was blanched between 80 and 100°C with an increment of 5°C for up to 14min and kinetics of the different physicochemical properties were studied. Significant reductions in the texture, colour, polyphenols (PPs) and antioxidant (AO) capacity were observed due to blanching. Total phenolic and flavonoid content retained ranged from 19.6–24.5% to 22.0–25.7%, respectively. Heavy losses in the AO capacity of 74.0–82.0% also occurred as a result of blanching. Blanching caused a significant reduction in firmness of 24.0–73.2% and a similar trend was also observed for colour. Kinetic evaluation of degradation was carried out for all the studied quality parameters. The fractional conversion first-order reaction model showed a good fit for the different studied parameters, with coefficients of determination ranging from 0.892 to 0.992, except for texture and colour, which followed first order and zero order kinetics, respectively. The temperature effect followed the Arrhenius law, with activation energies for polyphenolic content, AO capacity, colour and texture calculated as 9.22–11.5, 9.05–35.05, 15.73 and 33.8kJ/molK, respectively.","525.0"
"How much do cultivar and preparation time influence on phenolics content in walnut liqueur?","","The influence of cultivar and picking date on the phenolic content of walnut liqueur was investigated using HPLC with a PDA detector. Ten phenolic compounds, namely gallic, protocatechuic, ellagic, chlorogenic (5-caffeoylquinic), syringic, p-coumaric and sinapic acids, as well as (+)-catechin, 1,4-naphthoquinone and juglone were detected. The walnut liqueur under analysis was made of the cultivars 'Franquette' and 'Elit', on two sampling dates (June 30th and July 7th). A close interaction between cultivar and sampling date was noticed for most of the phenolics analyzed. The content levels of the main phenolic compounds under investigation were highest in 'Franquette' at the end of June and lowest in 'Elit' on the second or both sampling dates, except for syringic acid. A strong influence of cultivar choice and picking date was observed. The content levels of most phenolics were higher in liqueur prepared from the cultivar 'Franquette', than in 'Elit'.","526.0"
"Tissue distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rat","19517453.0","Sesame exhibits many beneficial physiological effects, which are mostly related to its lignan compounds, such as sesaminol glucosides. This investigation studies the distribution and elimination of sesaminol triglucoside from sesame in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. In order to investigate the distribution of sesaminol triglucoside (p.o. 500 mg/kg) in SD rats, the changes in concentration of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites were determined in tissues and plasma within 24 h period after tube-feeding to SD rats. Results showed that sesaminol triglucoside may be deglycosylated to form sesaminol first by intestinal microflora and then incorporated via lymphatic absorption into the cardiovascular system, transported to other tissues. The concentrations of sesaminol triglucoside and its metabolites in rectum, caecum, colon, and small intestines are higher than those in liver, lung, kidney, and heart. Its concentration in brain is low but detectable. Glucuronidation and sulfation was the main metabolic pathway for sesaminol in urine, and fecal elimination was a major route of elimination. From LC/MS/MS analysis of rat organs, sesaminol triglucoside can be converted to mammalian lignans, enterodiol (END), and enterolactone (ENL), by rat intestinal microflora. In the plasma, concentrations of END and ENL were 5.9 +/- 0.2 and 5.5 +/- 0.2 micromol/mL, respectively.","527.0"
"RP-HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using a CoulArray detector","16013828.0","Methods were developed for the analysis of natural antioxidants including phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beverages and plant extracts using gradient HPLC with multi-channel electrochemical coulometric detection. Suitability of various reversed-phase columns for this purpose was compared; pH and mobile phase gradients were optimized with respect to the separation selectivity and sensitivity of detection. Because of different target compounds in various sample types, the overlapping resolution maps and the normalized resolution product approaches described earlier were used to select optimum columns and gradients to suit the analysis of the individual sample types. The methods were applied to the analysis of phenolic compounds and flavonoids in beer, wine, tea, and yacon extracts. 32 phenolic compounds were identified and determined, including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides. Eight-channel CoulArray detection offers high selectivity and sensitivity with limits of detection in the low microg L(-1) range, at least an order of magnitude lower than single-channel coulometric detection using the Coulochem detector. No special sample pretreatment is necessary and, because of the compatibility of the CoulArray detector with gradient elution, phenolic antioxidants of different polarities can be determined in a single run. In addition to the retention times, the ratios of the areas of the pre-dominant and post-dominant peaks to the area of the dominant peak can be used for improved identification of natural antioxidants.","528.0"
"Antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of Iranian Ocimum accessions","","Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is used in traditional medicine, as a culinary herb and a well-known source of flavouring principles. Total antioxidant activity in 23 Iranian basil accessions was determined as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Total phenolic contents were determined using a spectrophotometric technique, based on the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, according to the method of Spanos and Wrolstad [Journal of Agricultural & Food Chemistry, 38 (1990) 1565] and calculated as gallic acid equivalents GAE/g dw.

"Flavonoids in fine buckwheat (fagopyrum esculentum Moench) flour and their free radical scavenging activities","","Millets are rich in nutritional and bioactive compounds, including polyphenols and flavonoids, and have the potential to combat malnutrition and various diseases. However, extracting these bioactive compounds can be challenging, as conventional methods are energy-intensive and can lead to thermal degradation. Green-assisted techniques have emerged as promising methods for sustainable and efficient extraction. This review explores recent trends in employing green-assisted techniques for extracting bioactive compounds from millets, and potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The objective is to evaluate and comprehend the parameters involved in different extraction methods, including energy efficiency, extraction yield, and the preservation of compound quality. The potential synergies achieved by integrating multiple extraction methods, and optimizing extraction efficiency for millet applications are also discussed. Among several, Ultrasound and Microwave-assisted extraction stand out for their rapidity, although there is a need for further research in the context of minor millets. Enzyme-assisted extraction, with its low energy input and ability to handle complex matrices, holds significant potential. Pulsed electric field-assisted extraction, despite being a non-thermal approach, requires further optimization for millet-specific applications, are few highlights. The review emphasizes the importance of considering specific compound characteristics, extraction efficiency, purity requirements, and operational costs when selecting an ideal technique. Ongoing research aims to optimize novel extraction processes for millets and their byproducts, offering promising applications in the development of millet-based nutraceutical food products. Therefore, the current study benefits researchers and industries to advance extraction research and develop efficient, sustainable, and scalable techniques to extract bioactive compounds from millets.","531.0"
"Direct determination of phenolic compounds and phospholipids in virgin olive oil by micellar liquid chromatography","","A simple HPLC method is reported for fast separation and determination of phenolic compounds (tyrosol, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and oleuropeina) and phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine) in virgin olive oil samples. The samples were diluted with 2-propanol and injected into the column directly without previous extraction. Samples with an olive oil content of up to 65% were injected without any problems. The analytes were separated on a C-18 column by a micellar mobile phase containing 0.07 M SDS and 2.5% 2-propanol at pH 3, and were detected at 210 nm. Linear calibration curves [r2 > 0.997] were obtained with detection limits ranging from 0.052 to 0.16 μg/g and 1 to 8.6% repeatability for the phenolic compounds.

"Antioxidant activity of processed table beets (Beta vulgaris var. conditiva) and green bean (Phaseolus vulgaria L.)","","It has been shown that thermal processing of tomatoes and sweet corn results in increased antioxidant activities despite the loss of vitamin C. Until now, it is unclear whether this positive effect of thermal processing occurs with all crop produce. Therefore, analysis of a root vegetable (beets) and of a legume (green beans) was undertaken to address this question. Antioxidant activity of beets processed under typical commercial processing conditions remained constant despite an 8% loss of vitamin C, a 60% loss of color, and 30% loss of dietary folate. There was a slight but significant 5% increase in phenolic content of processed beets. In contrast, vitamin C and dietary folate content of green beans remained constant, whereas a 32% reduction in phenolic compounds occurred after typical commercial processing conditions. The antioxidant activity of green beans was reduced by 20%. These findings along with previous works suggest that the effects of thermal processing vary with the respective produce crop type. It also reinforces the concept that optimal health benefits may be achieved when a wide variety of plant foods (fruits, vegetables and whole grains) and preparation methods are incorporated into the diet.","533.0"
"A urinary profile study of dietary phytoestrogens. The identification and mode of metabolism of new isoflavonoids","7662591.0","The metabolic fate of the dietary isoflavones daidzein and genistein was investigated in human volunteers challenged with soya. Urinary diphenols, isolated by partition chromatography on Sephadex LH-20, were characterized and identified by profile capillary gas chromatography (GC) and electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC-EIMS) analysis of the trimethylsilyl ether (TMS) derivatives. Novel isoflavonic phytoestrogens found in the urine of volunteers were those of tetrahydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, 6'-hydroxy-O-demethylangolesin and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin. Other known diphenols identified were those of equal, dehydrodaidzein, O-demethylangolensin, daidzein, genistein, glycitein, and the lignan enterolactone. Two other urinary isomers with a fragmentation pattern closely resembling that of the persilylated TMS ethers of cis/trans-isomers of tetrahydrodaidzein, were characterized based on the elucidation of fragments associated with the loss of a non-phenolic-OTMS functional group in ring-C. These are fragments presented in the persilylated mass spectra of isoflavan-4-ols and isoflav-3-ene-4-ols, demonstrated here by a combination of simple and tandem mass spectrometry study of the deuterated persilylated TMS ethers of dihydrodaidzein. In a similar study we also present the data on the structural identification and fragment elucidation of the keto/enol tautomers of the TMS ether derivatives of the dihydro derivatives of daidzein and genistein, observed in the urine of volunteers and considered probable products of the derivatization process. Finally, the GC and GC-MS data of two unknown isoflavonoids and that of a lignan-like compound are presented together with those of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, tetrahydrodaidzein and 2-dehydro-O-demethylangolensin.

"Composition of flavonoids in fresh herbs and calculation of flavonoid intake by use of herbs in traditional Danish dishes","","Many herbs are known as excellent sources of natural antioxidants, and consumption of fresh herbs in the diet may therefore contribute to the daily antioxidant intake. The present study was performed in order to quantify flavonoids in commonly eaten fresh herbs. Fifteen fresh herbs (basil, chives, coriander, cress, dill, lemon balm, lovage, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, spearmint, tarragon, thyme, and watercress) were analysed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Five major flavonoid aglycones were detected and quantified by HPLC after acid hydrolysis: apigenin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin. The highest levels of flavonoids were found in parsley (510-630 mg apigenin/100 g), lovage (170 mg quercetin/100 g), mint (18-100 mg apigenin/100 g), and dill (48-110 mg quercetin/100 g). Mass spectrometric detection, using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI), was used to verify the presence of flavonoids in the hydrolysed extracts of herbs. Some traditional Danish dishes contain herbs, particularly parsley, dill, cress and chives, and the contribution to the flavonoid intake by consumption of these dishes was calculated.","537.0"
"Interaction of vitamin C and flavonoids in elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) during juice processing","9950080.0","A field experiment and two oxidation experiments in the laboratory were carried out. The content of the major anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-G) and cyanidin-3-sambubioside (Cy-3-Sa), in the fresh fruits from the 13 cultivars were from 361 to 1266 and from 269 to 656 mg/100 g, respectively. The two minor anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucoside (Cy-3-Sa-5-G) and cyanidin-3.5-diglucoside (Cy-3.5-dG), occurred in concentrations between 5 and 47 mg/100 g. The content of ascorbic acid and quercetin in the fresh fruits of the cultivars varied from 6 to 25, and from 29 to 60 mg/100 g, respectively. Purging of the elderberry juice with N2 and/or addition of ascorbic acid reduced the oxidative degradation rate of the two major anthocyanins and quercetin. Ascorbic acid protected the anthocyanins, but not quercetin from oxidative degradation. Mixing of fruits with air during processing and even a low content of oxygen in the juice before tapping must be avoided by appropriate steps during processing. Improvement of the nutritional value of the elderberry juice and increased protection of anthocyanins against oxidative degradation may potentially be obtained by selection of cultivars with a high content of ascorbic acid.","538.0"
"Use Lactobacillus plantarum in olive oil process and improvement of phenolic compounds content","","The olive fruit intended for oil extraction was inoculated by Lactobacillus plantarum to evaluate the anti-oxidative effect. Results showed that orthodiphenols, in particular dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl of elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (Hy-EDA) increased their concentration in oils issued from the olive fruits inoculated by Lactobacillus. Among non-orthodiphenols, the tyrosol increased their concentration. Oil quality issued from inoculated olive fruits had a higher quality. The difference between the acidity, K232 and K270 indices and sensory quality shows clearly the positive effect of Lactobacillus on olive oil quality. Beside, aqueous phase showed a higher concentration of phenolics when the olive fruits were inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum.

Anthocyanins were the main phenolic constituents in bilberry, bog-whortleberry, and cranberry, but in cowberries, belonging also to the family Ericaceae genus Vaccinium, flavanols and procyanidins predominated. In the family Rosaceae genus Rubus (cloudberry and red raspberry), the main phenolics found were ellagitannins, and in genus Fragaria (strawberry), ellagitannins were the second largest group after anthocyanins. However, phenolic acids were dominant in rowanberries (genus Sorbus) and anthocyanins in chokeberry (genus Aronia). In the family Grossulariaceae genus Ribes (currants and gooseberry), anthocyanins predominated, as well as in crowberries (family Empetraceae genus Empetrum). In apples, hydroxycinnamic acids were the main phenolic subgroup. Extraction methods for berries and apples were studied to produce phenolic extracts with high antioxidant activity. Evaluation of antioxidant activity was performed by autoxidazing methyl linoleate (40 degrees C, in the dark).

Hydroxycinnamic acids, with chlorogenic acid as dominating constituent, ranged from 57 to 68 mg/L as well as from 134-593 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that from cider apples, respectively. Dessert apple juices showed lower contents of dihydrochalcones (10-35 mg/L) and flavan-3-ols (50-95 mg/L) compared to that of cider apples (34-171 mg/L and 70-393 mg/L, respectively). Quercetin and its derivatives were found from 0.4-4 mg/L and 0.4-27 mg/L in juices made from dessert apples and that of cider apples, respectively. Compared with freshly made juices, lower contents of polyphenols were determined in the commercial samples under study. Amounts ranging from 110-459 mg/L, dominated by chlorogenic acid with concentrations from 53-217 mg/L, were determined.

Chem. 1995, 41, 1738-1744) and total phenolic, anthocyanin, and ascorbate content. The four fruit varied markedly in their total antioxidant capacity, and antioxidant capacity was strongly correlated with the content of total phenolics (0.83) and anthocyanins (0.90). The antioxidant capacity of the two blueberry species was about 3-fold higher than either strawberries or raspberries. However, there was an increase in the antioxidant capacity of strawberries and raspberries during storage at temperatures >0 degrees C, which was accompanied by increases in anthocyanins in strawberries and increases in anthocyanins and total phenolics in raspberries. Ascorbate content differed more than 5-fold among the four fruit species; on average, strawberries and raspberries had almost 4-times more ascorbate than highbush and lowbush blueberries. There were no ascorbate losses in strawberries or highbush blueberries during 8 days of storage at the various temperatures, but there were losses in the other two fruit species. Ascorbate made only a small contribution (0.4-9.4%) to the total antioxidant capacity of the fruit. The increase observed in antioxidant capacity through postharvest phenolic synthesis and metabolism suggested that commercially feasible technologies may be developed to enhance the health functionality of small fruit crops.","546.0"

"Changes in volatile and phenolic compounds with malaxation time and temperature during virgin olive oil production","17002434.0","Virgin olive oils produced at wide ranges of malaxation temperatures (15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees C) and times (30, 60, 90, and 120 min) in a complete factorial experimental design were discriminated with stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) revealing differences with processing conditions. Virgin olive oils produced at 15 and 60 degrees C for 30 min showed the most significant (p < 0.01) differences. Discrimination was based upon volatile and phenolic compounds detected in olive oils, peroxide value (PV), free fatty acids (FFA), ultraviolet (UV) absorbances, and oil yield. There were different discriminating variables for processing conditions illustrating the dependence of virgin olive oil quality on malaxation time and temperature. Volatile compounds were the dominant discriminating variables. Common oxidation indicators of olive oil (PV, K232, and K270) were not among the variables that significantly (p < 0.01) changed with malaxation time and temperature. Variables that discriminated both malaxation time and temperature were hexanal, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ethyl alcohol-decarboxymethyl elenolic acid dialdehyde (3,4-DHPEA-DEDA) and FFA, whereas 1-penten-3-ol, E-2-hexenal, octane, tyrosol, and vanillic acid significantly (p < 0.01) changed with temperature only and Z-2-penten-1-ol, (+)-acetoxypinoresinol, and oil yield changed with time only. Virgin olive oil quality was significantly influenced by malaxation temperature, whereas oil yield discriminated malaxation time. This study demonstrates the two modes of hexanal formation: enzymatic and nonenzymatic during virgin olive oil extraction.","548.0"
"Variations in the Composition of Sterols, Tocopherols and Lignans in Seed Oils from 4 Sesamum Species","","Sesame seeds (<i>Sesamum indicum</i> L.) have been cultivated for thousands of years and have long been celebrated for their culinary versatility. Beyond their delightful nutty flavor and crunchy texture, sesame seeds have also gained recognition for their remarkable health benefits. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the numerous ways in which sesame seeds contribute to overall well-being. Sesame seeds are a powerhouse of phytochemicals, including lignans derivatives, tocopherol isomers, phytosterols, and phytates, which have been associated with various health benefits, including the preservation of cardiovascular health and the prevention of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and brain dysfunction. These compounds have also been substantiated for their efficacy in cholesterol management. Their potential as a natural source of beneficial plant compounds is presented in detail. The article further explores the positive impact of sesame seeds on reducing the risk of chronic diseases thanks to their rich polyunsaturated fatty acids content. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remember the significance of maintaining a well-rounded diet to achieve the proper balance of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, a balance lacking in sesame seed oil. The significance of bioactive polypeptides derived from sesame seeds is also discussed, shedding light on their applications as nutritional supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional ingredients. Recognizing the pivotal role of processing methods on sesame seeds, this review discusses how these methods can influence bioactive compounds. While roasting the seeds enhances the antioxidant properties of the oil extract, certain processing techniques may reduce phenolic compounds.","549.0"
"Quantification of anthocyanins in black carrot extracts (Daucus carota ssp. sativus var. atrorubens Alef.) and evaluation of their color properties","","Black carrot (<i>Daucus carota</i> ssp. <i>sativus</i> var. <i>atrorubens</i> Alef.) is widely recognized for its bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties. The black carrot of Cuevas Bajas (Málaga) is a local variety characterized by a black/purple core, which differs from other black carrot varieties. Therefore, this autochthonous variety was characterized according to the root size and the harvesting season by means of a study of its antioxidant capacity analyzed by three methods, its total carotenoids content, and its sugars and phenolic compounds profile by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). A total of 20 polyphenolic compounds were quantified in 144 samples analyzed. The anthocyanidins group was observed to be the most abundant, followed by the hydroxycinnamic acids group. Moreover, pelargonidin 3-sambubioside was observed in black carrot for the first time. The medium-sized carrots presented the highest content of phenolic compounds, largely due to their significantly higher anthocyanidins content. Comparatively, the small carrots showed a higher content of simple sugars than the large ones. Regarding the influence of season, significantly higher quantities of glucose and fructose were observed in the late-season carrots, while sucrose was the main sugar in early-season samples. No significant differences were observed in the total carotenoid content of black carrot.","550.0"
"Bioavailability of isoflavones after ingestion of soy beverages in healthy adults","16920843.0","It is unknown whether the bioavailability of isoflavones is affected by the concomitant ingestion of glucosides or aglycones. This study was designed to investigate the effects of soymilk-based beverages containing different types of isoflavones on their absorption, excretion, and metabolism. Twelve healthy volunteers consumed 3 kinds of soymilk: untreated soymilk, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk, and fermented soymilk. Blood samples were collected after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h. Urine samples were collected from 0 to 48 h. Concentrations of isoflavones and daidzein metabolites in serum and urine were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After the ingestion of soymilk, the total concentration of isoflavones in serum rose slowly and reached a maximum of 0.94 +/- 0.39 micromol/L at 6.0 +/- 1.2 h. However, beta-glucosidase-treated soymilk and fermented soymilk increased the serum isoflavone concentration significantly more quickly with maximum concentrations at 1.0 h of 1.75 +/- 0.33 micromol/L and 2.05 +/- 0.32 micromol/L, respectively. The urinary excretion of isoflavones after ingesting of these aglycone-enriched preparations was significantly greater than after consumption of untreated soymilk up to 8 h after injection, but not thereafter. The total and individual concentrations of isoflavones in serum and urine did not differ when subjects consumed the 2 aglycone-enriched soymilks. However, in equol producers (n = 5), the ingestion of ESM tended to increase urinary excretion of equol compared with the consumption of FSM (P = 0.08). These results demonstrated that the isoflavone aglycones of soymilk were absorbed faster and in greater amounts than their glucosides in healthy adults and that the metabolism of isoflavones might be affected by the type of soymilk consumed.","551.0"
"Polyphenolic composition of raisins","11087484.0","The polyphenolics of raisins were extracted, separated by HPLC, and characterized by their UV-vis spectra, and their concentrations measured. Color measurements and browning indices were also determined. Samples (n = 20) included sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins. Comparisons were also made with fresh and frozen Thompson Seedless grapes. Golden raisins (which are treated with SO(2)) had the highest amount of hydroxycinnamic acids and the highest lightness values. In comparison with fresh grapes, percent losses of the two major hydroxycinnamics (caftaric and coutaric acids) in sun-dried, dipped, and golden raisins were on the order of 90%. Flavonols were not influenced by processing as much as hydroxycinnamics, while procyanidins and flavan-3-ols were completely degraded in all raisin samples. Formation of hydroxymethylfurfural and loss of amino acids in sun-dried and dipped raisins are ascribed to Maillard browning reactions.","552.0"

"Effect of parboiling on texture and flavor components of cooked rice","","Rice is a fundamental food source for more than fifty percent of the world's population, significantly contributing to human nutrition and food security. Like other cereal grains, rice is rich in starch, although it also contains protein, vitamins, and minerals. Regular consumption of white rice has been reported to be positively associated with the increased risk of type 2 diabetes in rice-consuming countries due to the high glycemic index (GI) of white rice. However, the nutritional value and health effects of rice differ markedly depending on the variety and are influenced by processing methods, cooking styles employed, and the presence of other food components/ingredients. Therefore, this review examines the chemical compositions, starch structures, and glycemic indices of different rice types and the impact of processing techniques and genetic mutation on starch's structure, amylose content, and GI. The interactions between rice starch and other food components, such as proteins, lipids, dietary fibers, and polyphenols, and their impact on the digestibility and GI of rice starch are also discussed. The purpose of this comprehensive review is to elucidate the strategies that can improve the nutritional advantages of rice and mitigate health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and inflammation, linked to the long-term consumption of rice.","555.0"
"Anti-oxidant activity and total phenolic content of some Asian vegetables","","The anti-oxidant activity of extracts from 36 vegetables was evaluated by using a model system consisting of beta-carotene and linoleic acid. The total phenolics of the extracts was determined spectrophotometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteau procedure and ranged from 34 to 400 mg (100 g)-1 on a fresh weight basis. Mint, aonla, black carrots, chenopodium, fenugreek, kachnar and ginger had high phenolic contents. The anti-oxidant activity expressed as per percent inhibition of oxidation ranged from a high of 92% in turmeric extracts to a low of 12.8% in long melon. Other vegetables found to have high anti-oxidant activity (> 70%) were kachnar, aonla, ginger, fenugreek, mint, beetroot, black carrots, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, lotus stem, yam, coriander and tomato. Antioxidant activity correlated significantly and positively with total phenolics (r(2) = 0.6578, P < 0.05). The results indicate that vegetables containing high phenolics may provide a source of dietary anti-oxidants.","556.0"
"Different profiles of quercetin metabolites in rat plasma: comparison of two administration methods","19270373.0","The bioavailability of polyphenols in human and rodents has been discussed regarding their biological activity. We found different metabolite profiles of quercetin in rat plasma between two administration procedures. A single intragastric administration (50 mg/kg) resulted in the appearance of a variety of metabolites in the plasma, whereas only a major fraction was detected by free access (1% quercetin). The methylated/non-methylated metabolites ratio was much higher in the free access group. Mass spectrometric analyses showed that the fraction from free access contained highly conjugated quercetin metabolites such as sulfo-glucuronides of quercetin and methylquercetin. The metabolite profile of human plasma after an intake of onion was similar to that with intragastric administration in rats. In vitro oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein showed that methylation of the catechol moiety of quercetin significantly attenuated the antioxidative activity. These results might provide information about the bioavailability of quercetin when conducting animal experiments.","557.0"

"Anthocyanin metabolites in human urine and serum","15228048.0","In the present study we investigated the metabolic conversion of cyanidin glycosides in human subjects using solid-phase extraction,HPLC-diode array detector, MS, GC, and enzymic techniques. Volunteers consumed approximately 20 g chokeberry extract containing 1.3 g cyanidin 3-glycosides (899 mg cyanidin 3-galactoside, 321 mg cyanidin 3-arabinoside, 51 mg cyanidin 3-xyloside and 50 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside). Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h post-consumption of the extract. Urine samples were also collected at 0, 4-5,and 22-24h. We have confirmed that human subjects have the capacity to metabolise cyanidin 3-glycosides, as we observed at least ten individual anthocyanin metabolites in the urine and serum. Average concentrations of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites in the urine reached levels of 17.9 (range 14.9-20.9) l.mol/l within 5 h post-consumption and persisted in 24h urine samples at levels of 12.1 (range 11.1-13.0) nmol/l. In addition, average total levels of anthocyanins and anthocyanin metabolites detected in the serum were observed at 5917 (range 197.3-986.1) nmol/ within 2h post-consumption. Cyanidin 3-galactoside accounted for 55.4% (9.9(range 7-2-12-6) l.mol/) and 66.0% (390.6 (range 119.4-661-9) nmol V) of the detected anthocyanins in the urine and serum samples,respectively. The metabolites were identified as glucuronide conjugates, as well as methylated and oxidised derivatives of cyanidin 3-galactoside and cyanidin glucuronide. Conjugation probably affects the biological activity of anthocyanins and these metabolic products are likely in part responsible for the reported health benefits associated with the consumption of anthocyanins.","559.0"
"Anthocyanins exist in the circulation primarily as metabolites in adult men","16251615.0","Anthocyanins are reported to have many ""health promoting"" properties; however, despite numerous reports of their bioactivities, their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly understood. The objective of this research was to detail the pharmacokinetic parameters of anthocyanins after the administration of a 721-mg oral dose of cyanidin 3-glycosides from chokeberry extract to human subjects. Solid-phase extraction, preparative-HPLC, preparative-TLC, HPLC-diode array detection, HPLC-MS, and NMR were utilized to isolate, identity, and quantify anthocyanins in 0- to 7-h (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 h) serum and 0- to 24-h urine samples (total individual urine voids over 24 h). The cumulative concentration of total anthocyanins (parent and metabolites) detected in the serum (0-7 h) was 376.65 +/- 16.20 (nmol x h)/L (area under the concentration time curve), reaching a maximum concentration (C(max) = 96.08 +/- 6.04 nmol/L) within 2.8 h. The parent anthocyanins represented only 32.0% [120.63 +/- 2.85 (nmol x h)/L] of the total anthocyanins detected with 68.0% [256.02 +/- 5.23 (nmol x h) identified as conjugated metabolites. Additionally, the total urinary excretion of anthocyanins over 24 h was 1071.54 +/- 375.46 microg, reaching a maximal rate of excretion (R(max) = 202.74 +/- 85.06 microg/h) at 3.72 +/- 0.83 h. Parallel to the serum data, only 32.5% (347.85 +/- 60.61 microg) of the anthocyanins excreted in the urine (total 24 h) were the parent compounds with 67.5% (723.69 +/- 92.59 microg) occurring as conjugated metabolites. The metabolites were identified as glucuronidated and methylated derivatives of the parent cyanidin 3-glycosides. The above results indicate that cyanidin 3-glycosides are rapidly absorbed and metabolized extensively following a moderate-to-high oral dose in humans.","560.0"
"The antioxidant activity and stability of the phenolic fraction of green olives and extra virgin olive oil","","The antioxidant activity of phenolic extracts from olives and olive oil has been assessed by scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and by studying the effects on the stability of stripped olive oil in the absence and presence of ferric chloride. The olive extracts contained a much higher concentration (1940-5800 mg kg(-1)) of phenolic components than the olive oil extract (180 mg kg(-1)). Some olive extracts were more effective than the olive oil extract in scavenging DPPH radicals, but the three varieties of olives examined showed relatively large differences in both polyphenol concentration and antioxidant activity of extracts. alpha-Tocopherol and extracts from both olives and olive oil were effective antioxidants in stripped olive oil at 60 degrees C. Ferric chloride reduced the stability of stripped olive oil, but the olive extract studied was significantly more effective as an antioxidant in the presence of the metal salt than the olive oil extract or alpha-tocopherol. Ferric ions catalysed the oxidation of caffeic acid, oleuropein and phenolic components of the olive and olive oil extracts in aqueous solution (pH 5.4). The olive extract oxidised more rapidly than the olive oil extract in aqueous solution.","561.0"
"Analyses of phenolic and furfural compounds in concentrated and non-concentrated apple juices","","The mycotoxin patulin in processed apple juice poses a significant threat to food safety, driving the need for effective detoxification strategies. <i>Gluconobacter oxydans</i> ATCC 621 can detoxify patulin to ascladiol using either the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs)─GOX0525, GOX1899, and GOX0716─or the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) GOX1462. While GOX0525 and GOX1899 have been previously characterized, this study focuses on GOX0716 and GOX1462, evaluating their optimal pH, thermostability, thermoactivity, and substrate specificity, thereby completing the characterization of all four reductases. GOX0716 and GOX1462 exhibit pH optima of 6 and 7, respectively, and are functional across a broad temperature range of 25-55 °C. GOX0716 was determined to be more thermostable than GOX1462, with a half-life of 4.95 h at 55 °C. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these SDRs belong to distinct evolutionary families with broad substrate specificity. GOX0716 is a member of the SDR79 family, which shares a common ancestry with the SDR111 family of fungal anthrol reductases. Conversely, GOX1462 is a member of the AKR18 family, which is involved in detoxification of the mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol (DON). Molecular docking analysis of Alphafold models highlights distinct variations in the active site architectures of these SDRs and AKRs, offering insights into their differing catalytic efficiencies toward patulin.","562.0"
"Growth, phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of some medicinal plants grown under organic farming condition","","Drought stress is one of the most significant climatic challenges, severely affecting the productivity of medicinal and aromatic plants. Kaolin, a mineral with highly effective reflective properties, has been identified as a useful tool for enhancing plant resilience to abiotic stresses. This study examined the effects of kaolin concentrations (0%, 2%, 4%, and 8%) on the growth, physiological, and phytochemical attributes of Thymus vulgaris L. under drought conditions (100%, 75%, and 50% of field capacity (FC)). The findings revealed that the best performance in growth parameters (plant diameter, height, leaf dimensions (length and width), fresh and dry weight, as well as chlorophyll concentration) was observed with the 4% kaolin foliar application under 100% field capacity conditions. The highest concentration of proline, malondialdehyhe, hydrogen peroxide and cell membrane damage was observed under drought stress (50% FC), However, foliar application of kaolin 8% led to reduced these levels compared to untreated plants grown under the same water deficit (50% FC). Foliar application of kaolin (8%) under water deficit (50% FC) also increased total phenolic concentration, total flavonoid concentration, antioxidant activity and essential oil percentage. Rosmarinic acid content in plants treated with kaolin (8%) under drought conditions (50% FC) increased 1.6 times compared to untreated plants. An investigation of changes in enzymatic and non-enzymatic systems showed that kaolin improves the antioxidant capacity of T. vulgaris under drought stress and increases its resistance. Notably, kaolin also facilitated faster restauration of physiological functions during stress recovery. In summary, kaolin foliar sprays alleviated the negative effects of water stress in T. vulgaris performance by modulating distinct physiological and biochemical responses. This suggests kaolin application can support the cultivation and production of T. vulgaris in low-yielding and arid lands.","563.0"
"Polyphenols and tannins in Indian pulses: Effect of soaking, germination and pressure cooking","","Polyphenols and tannins have implications for health and nutrition. There is limited information on their content in pulses, raw or post-processing. We estimated the concentrations of polyphenols and tannins in different cultivars of four pulses commonly consumed in India – Phaseolus aureus, Cajanus cajan, Lens esculenta and Cicer arietinum – and examined the effects of domestic processing. Means and standard deviations were calculated and results were analyzed by ANOVA. There were significant differences (P < 0.001) in the polyphenol and tannin contents of cultivars of the same pulse, with the exception of the tannin contents of pressure-cooked red gram cultivars (P = 0.3103). Processing reduced the concentrations of polyphenols by 19–59% and of tannins by 22–59%. A trend was observed in the degree to which processing reduced polyphenol and tannin contents (germination > pressure-cooking > soaking). Soaking, germination and pressure-cooking proved to be effective household strategies to reduce the levels of polyphenols and tannins in pulse-based foods, thereby enhancing the bioavailability of pulse protein. There is a need to determine the extent to which the remaining polyphenols and tannins are rendered unavailable by these processing techniques.","564.0"

Tea bags or tea leaves were purchased from local supermarkets and extracted in boiling water for 5 min. The resulting data showed considerable variability in both total phenols [80.5-134.9 mg/g of dry matter (DM) in black teas and 87-106.2 mg/g of DM in green teas] and catechins (5.6-47.5, 51.5-84.3, and 8.5-13.9 mg/g of DM in black, green, and fruit teas, respectively); this was most probably a result of differing agronomic conditions, leaf age, and storage during and after transport, as well as the degree of fermentation. Caffeine contents of black teas (22-28 mg/g of DM) were significantly higher than in less fermented green teas (11-20 mg/g of DM). The relative concentration of the five major tea catechins ranked EGCG > ECG > EC > EGC > C. The estimated U.K. dietary intakes of total tea catechins, calculated on the basis of an average tea consumption of three cups of tea (200 mL cup, 1% tea leaves w/v), were 61.5, 92.7, and 405.5 mg/day from fruit teas, black teas, and green teas, respectively. The coefficients of variation were 19.4, 88.6, and 17.3%, respectively, indicating the wide variation in these intakes. The calculated caffeine intake ranged between 92 and 146 mg/day. In addition, many individuals will consume much larger quantities of tea, of various strengths (as determined by the brewing conditions employed). This broad spread of U.K. daily intakes further emphasizes the need for additional research to relate intake and effect in various population groups.","566.0"
"Cocoa has more phenolic phytochemicals and a higher antioxidant capacity than teas and red wine","","Black tea, green tea, red wine, and cocoa are high in phenolic phytochemicals, among which theaflavin, epigallocatechin gallate, resveratrol, and procyanidin, respectively, have been extensively investigated due to their possible role as chemopreventive agents based on their antioxidant capacities. The present study compared the phenolic and flavonoid contents and total antioxidant capacities of cocoa, black tea, green tea, and red wine. Cocoa contained much higher levels of total phenolics (611 mg of gallic acid equivalents, GAE) and flavonoids (564 mg of epicatechin equivalents, ECE) per serving than black tea (124 mg of GAE and 34 mg of ECE, respectively), green tea (165 mg of GAE and 47 mg of ECE), and red wine (340 mg of GAE and 163 mg of ECE). Total antioxidant activities were measured using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays and are expressed as vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacities (VCEACs). Cocoa exhibited the highest antioxidant activity among the samples in ABTS and DPPH assays, with VCEACs of 1128 and 836 mg/serving, respectively. The relative total antioxidant capacities of the samples in both assays were as follows in decreasing order: cocoa > red wine > green tea > black tea. The total antioxidant capacities from ABTS and DPPH assays were highly correlated with phenolic content (r2 = 0.981 and 0.967, respectively) and flavonoid content (r2 = 0.949 and 0.915). These results suggest that cocoa is more beneficial to health than teas and red wine in terms of its higher antioxidant capacity.","567.0"

"Characterisation of polyphenols in green, oolong, and black teas, and in coffee, using cyclic voltammetry","","Phenolic compounds are important for their astringent taste and as antioxidants in health. Green, oolong and black tea and an instant coffee were each diluted 50 times in a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer and, along with phenolic standards, were analysed by cyclic voltammetry at a carbon electrode. Standards with a pyrogallol group (gallocatechins) were strong reducing agents and produced a peak at 90–120 mV, while those with a catechol or gallate group peaked at 180–220 mV. The response of green and oolong teas was dominated by epigallocatechin gallate, and levels determined by HPLC were consistent with the electrochemical response. Black tea behaved like a theaflavin extract, and coffee like 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, both with peaks at around 230 mV. The level of phenolics increased with water temperature from 20 to 100 °C, while lower levels were obtained for repeat infusions. The addition of milk (skim or full-fat alike) lowered the response more in the teas than in the coffee.","569.0"

"Antioxidant capacity of phenolic phytochemicals from various cultivars of plums","","Numerous health benefits have been attributed in the last decades to the regular consumption of fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, along with honey, in a balanced diet. In this context, the aim of the present review was to provide the literature with the most relevant studies focusing on the determination protocols of these polyphenols and other reducing agents in selected fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, prunus, apricot, peach, plum, sweet cherry), spices (oregano, cinnamon, clove, saffron, turmeric) and honey of different botanical origin (nectar or honeydew). In addition, the content and the extraction methods of these compounds, along with their metabolic pathway, have been critically evaluated and discussed. Results showed that all fruits, spices and honey exhibit a considerably high antioxidant activity, which is mainly owed to their phytochemical content.

Total anthocyanins of fruits ranged from 30.9 to 67.1 mg cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalent (CGE)/100 g. In 100 g of jam, total phenolics varied from 132.9 to 218.9 mg GAE, while antioxidant capacity ranged from 205.6 to 373.5 mg/100 g VCEAC. Jams had total anthocyanins of 5.4 to 30.4 mg CGE/100 g. On the basis of fresh fruit (100 g), the processing and heating during jam making generally decreased the contents of total phenolics, VCEAC, and total anthocyanins. Major losses occurred in anthocyanin content where overall retention varied from 89% to 21%. HPLC analysis of individual anthocyanins from cherry cv. Balaton to its jam showed that processing caused 90% decrease in anthocyanins. The results indicated that more than 73% total phenolics and more than 65% antioxidant capacity were retained after processing fruits into jams. Optimization of food processing would help to conserve the bioactive phenolic compounds in fruits.","572.0"
"Nondestructive determination of lignans and lignan glycosides in sesame seeds by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy","16786996.0","Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) contains abundant lignans including lipid-soluble lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and water-soluble lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) related to antioxidative activity. In this study, near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to develop a rapid and nondestructive method for the determination of lignan contents on intact sesame seeds. Ninety-three intact seeds were scanned in the reflectance mode of a scanning monochromator. This scanning procedure did not require the pulverization of samples, allowing each analysis to be completed within minutes. Reference values for lignan contents were obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Calibration equations for lignans (sesamin and sesamolin) and lignan glycosides (sesaminol triglucoside and sesaminol diglucoside) contents were developed using modified partial least squares regression with internal cross-validation (n = 63). The equations obtained had low standard errors of cross-validation and moderate R2 (coefficient of determination in calibration). The prediction of an external validation set (n = 30) showed significant correlation between reference values and NIRS predicted values based on the SEP (standard error of prediction), bias, and r2 (coefficient of determination in prediction). The models developed in this study had relatively higher values (more than 2.0) of SD/SEP(C) for all lignans and lignan glycosides except for sesaminol diglucoside, which had a minor amount, indicating good correlation between the reference and the NIRS estimate. The results showed that NIRS, a nondestructive screening method, could be used to rapidly determine lignan and lignan glycoside contents in the breeding programs for high quality sesame.","573.0"
"The impact of packaging materials on the antioxidant phytochemical stability of aqueous infusions of green tea (Camellia sinensis) and Yaupon Holly (Ilex vomitoria) during cold storage","21434687.0","Ready to drink (RTD) teas are a growing segment in the beverage category, brought about by improvements in the flavor of these products and healthy market trends driven by consumers. The presented results evaluated the antioxidant phytochemical stability of RTD teas from aqueous infusions of traditional green tea (Camellia sinensis) and a botanical tea from yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) as influenced by packaging materials during cold storage. Two common packaging materials for RTD products are glass and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and have been compared to a retortable pouch (RP), an emerging packaging material for various types of food since it is durable, inexpensive, lightweight, and easy to sterilize. Storage stability was then evaluated for each aqueous infusion prepared at 10 g/L at 90 °C for 10 min and evaluated at 3 °C in the absence of light over 12 weeks. Analyses included quantification and characterization of individual polyphenolics by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array and liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry as well as changes in total antioxidant capacity. For green tea, concentrations of the three major flavan-3-ols, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, and epicatechin gallate were better retained in glass bottles as compared to other packages over 12 weeks. In yaupon holly, chlorogenic acid and its isomers that were the predominant compounds were generally stable in each packaging material, and a 20.6-fold higher amount of saponin was found as compared to green tea, which caused higher stability of flavonol glycosides present in yaupon holly during storage. The antioxidant capacity of green tea was better retained in glass and PET versus RP, whereas no differences were again observed for yaupon holly. Results highlight the superiority of oxygen-impervious glass packaging, but viable alternatives may be utilizable for RTD teas with variable phytochemical compositions.","574.0"
"Dietary flaxseed supplementation ameliorates inflammation and oxidative tissue damage in experimental models of acute lung injury in mice","16702319.0","Flaxseed (FS) is a nutritional supplement with high concentrations of (n-3) fatty acids and lignans that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The use of FS in the prevention or treatment of acute lung disease is unknown. In this study, we evaluated diets with high FS content in experimental murine models of acute lung injury and inflammation. The kinetics of lignan accumulation in blood, following 10% FS supplementation, was determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mice were fed isocaloric control and 10% FS-supplemented diets for at least 3 wk and challenged by hyperoxia (80% oxygen), intratracheal instillation of lipopolysaccharide, or acid aspiration. Bronchoalveolar lavage was evaluated for white blood cells, neutrophils, and proteins after a 24 h postintratracheal challenge of hydrochloric acid or lipopolysaccharide, or after 6 d of hyperoxia. Lung lipid peroxidation was assessed by tissue malondialdehyde concentrations. The plasma concentrations of the FS lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, were stable after mice had eaten the diets for 2 wk. Following hyperoxia and acid aspiration, bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils decreased in FS-supplemented mice (P = 0.012 and P = 0.027, respectively), whereas overall alveolar white blood cell influx tended to be lower (P = 0.11). In contrast, neither lung injury nor inflammation was ameliorated by FS following lipopolysaccharide instillation. Lung malondialdehyde levels were lower in hyperoxic mice than in unchallenged mice (P = 0.0001), and decreased with FS treatment following acid aspiration (P = 0.011). Dietary FS decreased lung inflammation and lipid peroxidation, suggesting a protective role against pro-oxidant-induced tissue damage in vivo.","575.0"
"The extraction of beer polyphenols and their assay by HPLC","","Three types of solid waste are produced during beer fermentation: spent grain, hot trub, and residual yeast. While the first is used as livestock feed, the seconds has not yet found any real reapplication in the field of circular economy. The aim of this work is to study and characterize these two brewing wastes, i.e., hot trub and residual yeast, to evaluate their potential reuse in the agricultural field. Samples from top-fermented and bottom-fermented beers were chemically investigated. Initially, the safety was assessed via multi-detection analysis of 57 mycotoxins, and all samples were deemed safe. Subsequently, the chemical and elemental composition was examined via ICP-MS and microanalysis, along with phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity via HPLC and spectrophotometric determinations, to achieve a thorough characterization of these waste samples. The C/N ratio of residual yeast from top-fermented beer and hot trub of the bottom-fermented one were near the optimal one (10:1). This research marks an initial step towards repurposing brewery waste materials as fertilizers. The subsequent steps will involve the formulation and field trials.","576.0"
"Comparison of GC-MS and LC-MS methods for the analysis of antioxidant phenolic acids in herbs","17468851.0","Two methods were developed for the quantitative analysis of phenolic acids in herb extracts. The methods were based on liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The methods were compared in terms of their linearity, repeatability, selectivity, sensitivity and the speed of the analysis. The sensitivity was good for both methods, with limits of detection of <80 ng/ml for most of the compounds. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of the peak areas were on average 7.2% for the LC-TOFMS method and 1.4% for the GC-MS method. Both methods were found to be suitable for the determination of the target analytes, although GC-MS was better suited to the quantitative determination of compounds present at low concentrations.","577.0"

"Variation of the phenolic substances in onion","","Onion (Allium cepa L.) possesses strong antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties due to its rich content of flavonoids, phenolic compounds, vitamins, and minerals. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of thermosonication (TS) on enhancing the functional and bioactive properties of white onion juice. Three different treatments were applied: control (C-WOJ), thermal pasteurization (P-WOJ), and thermosonication (TS-WOJ). Using response surface methodology (RSM), the optimal TS conditions were determined as 45.45 °C, 12.90 min, and 67.67% amplitude. Under these conditions, total phenolic content (154.36 mg GAE/100 mL), total flavonoid content (19.62 mg CE/100 mL), and antioxidant activity (64.42%) significantly increased. TS also enhanced the levels of chlorogenic acid (355.71 μg/mL), catechin hydrate (123.86 μg/mL), and quercetin (153.13 μg/mL). Additionally, the TS group exhibited higher total amino acid content (15.64 mg/100 g), with notable increases in aspartic acid (3.82 mg/100 g) and glutamic acid (2.56 mg/100 g). Thermosonicated white onion juice demonstrated significant anticancer (inducing 11.9% apoptotic cell death in colon cancer cells), antihypertensive (ACE inhibition), and antidiabetic (α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition) effects. TS enhances the stability and bioavailability of bioactive components, offering a low-cost and effective alternative technology for the food industry.","579.0"

"Effect of storage on the content of polyphenols, vitamin C and the antioxidant activity of orange juices","","The effect of time and temperature on the content of vitamin C, total polyphenols and individual phenolic compounds as well as on the antioxidant activity of two commercial orange juices was studied. The polyphenol content was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu and HPLC methods. The two methods, SPE versus direct injection following a simple treatment of samples, were compared to assess two techniques of sample preparation. For antioxidant capacity determination, DPPH and FRAP assays were used. All analyses were carried out for fresh juices and after storage at 18, 28 and 38 °C for 2, 4 and 6 months. It was found that vitamin C and free and conjugated hydroxycinnamic acids were the most affected by both duration and temperature of storage. The decrease in the content of polyphenols and vitamin C upon storage was reflected by the decrease in the antioxidant capacity of orange juices. Small changes in flavanone content were observed, indicating high stability of these compounds upon storage.","581.0"
"Determination of isoflavones in soy and selected foods containing soy by extraction, saponification, and liquid chromatography: Collaborative study","11767157.0","Isoflavones are biologically active compounds occurring naturally in a variety of plants, with relatively high levels found in soybeans. Twelve laboratories participated in a collaborative study to determine the aglycon isoflavone content of 8 test samples of soy and foods containing soy. The analytical method for the determination of isoflavones incorporates a mild saponification step that reduces the number of analytes measured and permits quantitation versus commercially available, stable reference standards. Test samples were extracted at 65 degrees C with methanol-water (80 + 20), saponified with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with UV detection at 260 nm. Isoflavone results were reported as microg/aglycon/g or microg aglycon equivalents/g. The 8 test samples included 2 blind duplicates and 4 single test samples with total isoflavone concentrations ranging from approximately 50 to 3000 microg/g. Test samples of soy ingredients and products made with soy were distributed to collaborators with appropriate reference standards. Collaborators were asked to analyze test samples in duplicate on 2 separate days. The data were analyzed for individual isoflavone components, subtotals of daidzin-daidzein, glycitin-glycitein, and genistin-genistein, and total isoflavones. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability was 1.8-7.1%, and the RSD for reproducibility was 3.2-16.1% for total isoflavone values of 47-3099 microg/g.","582.0"
"Effects of phenolics in sorghum grain its bitterness, astringency and other sensory properties","","Despite the fact that condensed tannins are potentially important antioxidants, there is a general belief that tannins in sorghum confer objectionable sensory attributes. The objective of this study was to determine differences in the sensory attributes of sorghums containing different levels of total phenolic compounds. A trained sensory panel described and quantified the sensory attributes of different sorghums (condensed-tannin containing and tannin-free). All the sorghum cultivars were perceived as bitter and astringent. Bran infusions of tannin sorghums were perceived as darker, clearer, more bitter and more astringent than those of the tannin-free sorghums, while those of tannin-free sorghums were perceived as sweeter and cloudy. Sorghum whole-grain rice from the tannin sorghums which had relatively soft endosperm texture (PAN 3860 and Ex Nola 97 GH) was perceived as dark, hard, chewy, bitter and astringent, while that from tannin-free sorghums having relatively hard endosperm texture (Segaolane and Phofu) was perceived as soft, sweet and had a maize-flavour. Surprisingly, the bitterness and astringency, as well as other sensory attributes of NS 5511 (tannin sorghum), were perceived as similar to PAN 8564 (tannin-free sorghum) even though NS 5511 had more than twice the total phenol content of PAN 8564. This suggests not all condensed-tannin containing sorghums have objectionable sensory attributes.","583.0"

"Identification of metabolites of (-)-epicatechin gallate and their metabolic fate in the rat","12926915.0","After intravenous administration of (-)-epicatechin gallate to Wistar male rats, its biliary metabolites were examined. Deconjugated forms of (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites were prepared by beta-glucuronidase/sulfatase treatment and purified by HPLC. Five compounds were subjected to FAB-MS and NMR analyses. These metabolites were shown to be (-)-epicatechin gallate, 3'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, 4' '-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate, and 3',4' '-di-O-methyl-(-)-epicatechin gallate. After oral administration, five major metabolites excreted in rat urine were purified in their deconjugated forms and their chemical structures identified. They were degradation products from (-)-epicatechin gallate, pyrogallol, 5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 4-hydroxy-5-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)valeric acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, and m-coumaric acid. Time course analysis of the identified (-)-epicatechin gallate metabolites showed that (-)-epicatechin gallate and its conjugate appeared in the plasma with their highest levels 0.5 h after oral administration; their levels rapidly decreased, and then they disappeared by 6 h. The degradation products, mainly in their conjugated forms, emerged at 6 h, peaked at 24 h, and disappeared by 48 h. In urine samples, (-)-epicatechin gallate and its methylated metabolites were hardly detected and the degradation products began to be excreted in the 6-24 h period, peaked in the 24-48 h period, and then began to disappear. The most abundant metabolite in both the plasma and the urine was found to be the conjugated form of pyrogallol. On the basis of these results, a possible metabolic route of (-)-epicatechin gallate orally administered to the rat is proposed.","585.0"

"Phenolic acid contents in fruits of aubergine (Solanum Melongena L.)","","Eggplant is a nutritionally rich crop that has beneficial effects on human health. Wide diversity exists in eggplant in terms of biochemical content; however, extensive research work has not been undertaken to gain more in-depth knowledge on its antioxidant capacity to improve the quality of the existing popular cultivated varieties and develop/identify nutrient-rich germplasms. Therefore, a total of 57 genotypes were chosen for the study, and they were evaluated for various biochemical compounds. The biochemical traits taken were an average of three replications and these values were used for statistical analysis. The analysis of variance for five fruit quality parameters indicated a high variability among the eggplant genotypes, which signifies that at least one of the genotypes is statistically different from the rest. The total phenolics ranged from 39.63 to 312.65 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g with the highest being observed in Pusa Krishna. The flavonoid content ranged from 7.83 to 65.09 mg/100 g FW. The antioxidant assays, viz., cupric reducing antioxidant activity (CUPRAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), were evaluated which ranged from 51.48 to 200.36 mg GAE/100 g for CUPRAC and 35.36 to 214.01 mg GAE/100 g for FRAP. Principal component analysis (PCA) generated a total of five principal components, and the maximum variance of 90.72% was exhibited by the first three PCs. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) revealed similar results to the PCA by identifying three major clusters. Cluster 1 had a maximum number of genotypes grouped together, i.e., 48, followed by cluster 2 with six genotypes, viz., Pusa Krishna (G-32), G-5, Mayurbhanj Local, HABI-2, <i>Solanum gilo</i>, and <i>Solanum sisymbrifolium</i>, and cluster 3 had only three genotypes, namely, <i>Solanum insanum</i>, <i>Solanum khasianum</i>, and <i>Solanum xanthocarpum</i>.

"Rutin content in buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) food materials and products","","Buckwheat, a dicotyledonous pseudocereal from the Polygonaceae family, has emerged as a crop of scientific and industrial interest due to its exceptional phytochemical profile, adaptability to different environments, and minimal agronomic input requirements. This paper aims to highlight the proximate composition (carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber, lipids, starch, vitamins, and minerals) of the buckwheat principal species, <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i> Moench (common buckwheat) and <i>Fagopyrum tataricum</i> (L.) Gaertn (Tartary buckwheat). Other bioactive compounds, including flavonoids (e.g., rutin, quercetin), phenolic acids, and anthocyanins, were emphasized, together with their influence on human health. These constituents confer a broad range of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and hypoglycemic effects. Moreover, buckwheat is inherently gluten-free, making it a valuable alternative in formulations targeting gluten-sensitive populations.

"Aspalathin, a flavonoid in Aspalathus linearis (rooibos), is absorbed by pig intestine as a C-glycoside","19083477.0","Aspalathin, a dihydrochalcone and C-glycoside, is the most abundant flavonoid in rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which is well known as an herbal tea in many countries. Aspalathin appears to have in vitro antioxidative and antimutagenic effects. To understand the effects of aspalathin in the body, research on the absorption in the intestinal tract, metabolism in the body, and identification of circulating metabolites in vivo is required. We investigated the metabolism of aspalathin to identify the parent compound and related metabolites in urine and plasma after orally administering a rooibos extract (16.3% aspalathin by 96 g rooibos extract, which equates to 1.1 kg dried rooibos material), produced from unfermented rooibos plant material, to pigs over a period of 11 days (oral dosage, 157-167 mg aspalathin per kg body weight daily). On days 7 and 11 of the study and days 1 and 2 after termination, urine was collected in 24-hour fractions, and plasma samples were collected at various time points. To our knowledge, this is the first time aspalathin metabolites have been identified in vivo, by presenting evidence of the absorption of aspalathin. Six substances identified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were identified; these represent aspalathin and the metabolites methylated aspalathin, glucuronidated aspalathin glucuronidated and methylated aspalathin, a glucuronidated aglycone of aspalathin, as well as a metabolite of eriodictyol. The latter compound was methylated and contained 2 glucuronic acid moieties. This study showed that aspalathin can be absorbed by the intestine as C-glycoside as well as being cleaved in an aglycone and sugar moiety. The major metabolite in the enzymatically treated samples was methylated aspalathin. Between 0.1% and 0.9% of the administered dose of aspalathin could be detected in the urine on days 7 and 11 of the feeding study. No metabolites or aspalathin were found in plasma samples. The identification of the metabolites in vivo enables investigations to determine the biological potential of rooibos extracts.","598.0"
"Phenolic compounds, tocopherols and other minor components in virgin olive oils of some Tunisian varieties","","The phenols, α-tocopherols, fatty acids and oxidative stability of six monovarietal virgin olive oils (VOOs) were determined. Fourteen phenolic compounds were detected and quantified by solid phase extraction and reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography. Dialdehydic form of elenolic acid linked to tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones were the main components in all samples. Pinoresinol was the most abundant component in lignan fraction. The total phenol content of these monovarietal oils varied from 66.82 mg/kg in ""Neb Jmel"" oil to 662.74 mg/kg in ""El Hor"" oil. A wide range of α-tocopherol contents was also noticed; it varied from 141.94 mg/kg in ""Semni"" variety to 364.23 mg/kg in ""Jdallou"" variety. With regard to pigments, chlorophylls and carotenoids were found at variable concentrations: with median values of 11.33 and 3.10 mg/kg, respectively. Among the studied varieties, ""Oueslati"" and El Hor were characterized by the lowest levels of palmitic and linoleic acids and the highest values of oleic acid.","599.0"
"Thin-layer high-vacuum distillation to isolate volatile flavour compounds of cocoa powder","","The volatile fraction of commercial cocoa powders was isolated using thin-layer high-vacuum distillation (TLHVD) of Soxhlet extracts. Calculated and experimental recovery of the internal standard n-undecanoic acid methylester did agree, and a good reproducibility was found for the procedure. Around 70 volatile compounds were identified and semi-quantified using internal standard-based gas chromatography (GC), coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-olfactometry (GC-O). Dehydromevalonic acid lactone, (R)-(-)-pantolactone and two diastereomer solerols were identified for the first time after purification by micropreparative GC and re-analysis using GC-MS and chiral GC. Strong sensory contributions also came from acetic acid, 2/3-methyl butanoic acid, phenylacetaldehyde, furaneol, dihydroxymaltol, vanillin and phenylacetic acid.","600.0"
"Urinary total flavonoid excretion but not 4-pyridoxic acid or potassium can be used as a biomarker for the intake of fruits and vegetables","14747687.0","To gain better insight into the potential health effects of fruits and vegetables, reliable biomarkers of intake are needed. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of flavonoid excretion in both 24-h and morning urine samples to reflect a low intake and moderate changes in fruit and vegetable consumption. Furthermore, the urinary excretions of 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) and potassium were investigated as other potential biomarkers of fruit and vegetable intake. The study was designed as a 5-d randomized, controlled crossover study. On d 1-3, the men (n = 12) consumed a self-restricted flavonoid-free diet. On d 4, they were provided a strictly controlled diet containing no fruits or vegetables (basic diet). On d 5, they consumed the basic diet supplemented with 300 or 600 g of fruits and vegetables. The total excretion of flavonoids in 24-h urine samples increased linearly with increasing fruit and vegetable intakes (r(s) = 0.86, P < 1 x 10(-6)). The total excretion of flavonoids in morning urine also increased, but the association was weaker (r(s) = 0.59, P < 0.0001). Urinary 4-PA in 24-h and morning urine samples increased significantly only with the 600-g increase in fruit and vegetable intake, whereas the excretion of potassium in urine did not reflect the changes in fruit and vegetable intake. We conclude that the total excretion of flavonoids in 24-h urine may be used as a new biomarker for fruit and vegetable intake.","601.0"
"Relative bioavailability of the flavonoids quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin given simultaneously through diet","20125185.0","The bioavailability and urinary excretion of three dietary flavonoids, quercetin, hesperetin and naringenin, were investigated. Ten healthy men were asked to consume a 'juice mix' containing equal amounts of the three flavonoids, and their urine and plasma samples were collected. The resulting mean plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-48 h) and C(max) values for quercetin and hesperetin were similar, whereas the AUC(0-48 h) of naringenin and, thus, the relative bioavailability were higher after consumption of the same dose. The study consolidates a significantly lower urinary excretion of quercetin (1.5+/-1%) compared with hesperetin (14.2+/-9.1%) and naringenin (22.6+/-11.5%) and shows that this is not due to a lower bioavailability of quercetin, but rather reflects different clearance mechanisms.","602.0"
"Cultivar, storage conditions and ripening effects on physical and chemical qualities of red raspberry fruit","","The taste, aroma, and sensory characteristics of cherries are key factors influencing consumer acceptance. In this study, the sensory evaluation, biochemical characteristics, and their relationships with consumer satisfaction of several representative cherry cultivars were analyzed during cold storage to establish systematic quality evaluation parameters. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant differences in physiological quality and metabolic profiles among the tested cultivars. Specifically, 'Benitemari' demonstrated more contents of soluble solids and titratable acid, while 'Tieton' and 'Skeena' showed higher concentrations of volatile organic compounds and polyphenolics. Furthermore, hexanal and (E)-2-hexenal were identified as the dominant VOCs, while cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside was confirmed as a major phenolic component across the cultivars. Finally, the comprehensive score of the principal component model was significantly positively correlated with the scores of firmness, chewiness, sweetness, sourness, and taste and bitterness in the sensory evaluation. The results were expected to provide valuable guidance for standardizing the sweet cherry supply chain and cultivating high-quality sweet cherry cultivars.","603.0"
"Changes of physicochemical quality, phenolics and vitamin C content in hardy kiwifruit (Actinidia arguta and its hybrid) during storage","","A cold storage system is useful for maintaining the quality of hardy kiwifruit. However, extended cold storage periods inevitably result in cold stress, leading to lower fruit marketability; the severity of chilling injury depends on fruit types and cultivars. In this study, the impact of cold storage conditions on the physicochemical properties and antioxidant capacity of two phenotypically different hardy kiwifruit cultivars-'Cheongsan' (large type) and 'Daebo' (small type)-stored at low (L; 3 °C, relative humidity [RH]; 85-90%) and moderate-low (ML; 5 °C, RH; 85-90%) temperatures was determined. Significant differences in fruit firmness and titratable acidity between treatments L and ML were observed in both cultivars during the experimental storage period. Meanwhile, the browning and pitting rates of the 'Cheongsan' fruits in treatment L increased for 8 weeks compared with those of the 'Daebo' fruits in treatments L and ML; nonetheless, fruit decay was observed in the 'Daebo' fruits in treatment ML after 6 weeks. The total chlorophyll, carotenoid, flavonoid, and ascorbic acid concentrations as well as the antioxidant activities of both the cultivars significantly differed between treatments L and ML. After 2 weeks of storage, the 'Cheongsan' fruits in treatment L had lower antioxidant activities and ascorbic acid content than those in treatment ML. These results demonstrate that the quality attributes and antioxidant activity of hardy kiwifruit are influenced by the low-temperature storage conditions and the specific kiwifruit cultivars. Our findings suggest that optimal cold storage conditions, specific to each hardy kiwifruit cultivar, promise to maintain fruit quality, including their health-promoting compounds, during long-term storage.","604.0"
"Extraction and quantification of phytoestrogens in foods using automated solid-phase extraction and LC/MS/MS","17975893.0","Phytoestrogens are a group of polyphenolic plant metabolites that can induce biological responses. Their bioactivity is based on their similarity to 17beta-estradiol and their ability to bind to the beta-estrogen receptor. Although epidemiological data are inconclusive, phytoestrogens are considered to be beneficial for a variety of conditions, for example, hormone-related cancers like breast and prostate cancer. To investigate the biological effects of these compounds and to assess the exposure of larger cohorts or the general public, reliable data on the phytoestrogen content of food is necessary. Previously, food analysis for phytoestrogens was performed using either HPLC-UV or GC/MS. Here, we describe the development of the first generic method for the analysis of phytoestrogens in food, using automated solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The presented method shows a good reproducibility and can be easily adapted to other phytoestrogens if required.","605.0"
"Phytoestrogen content of beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils","18671400.0","Phytoestrogens are secondary plant metabolites that have received increasing attention for their bioactivity, in particular due to their structural and functional similarity to 17beta-estradiol.

Accurate information about dietary phytoestrogens is therefore important, but there are very limited data concerning food contents. In this study was analyzed a comprehensive selection of tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages, nuts, seeds, and oils for their phytoestrogen content using a newly developed sensitive method based on LC-MS incorporating (13)C 3-labeled standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analyzed, although the contents in gin and bitter (beer) were below the limit of quantification (1.5 microg/100 g). Lignans were the main type of phytoestrogens detected. Tea and coffee contained up to 20 microg/100 g phytoestrogens and beer (except bitter) contained up to 71 microg/100 g, mainly lignans. As these beverages are commonly consumed, they are a main source of dietary lignans. The results published here will contribute to databases of dietary phytoestrogen content and allow a more accurate determination of phytoestrogen exposure in free-living individuals.","606.0"

However, there is little information on isoflavone, lignan, and coumestrol content of cereals and cereal-based foods, leading to an underestimation of intake. This is the first study of phytoestrogens (isoflavones: biochanin A, daidzein, formononetin, genistein, glycitein; lignans: matairesinol, secoisplariciresinol; coumestrol) in a comprehensive selection of 101 cereals and cereal-based foods-including breads, breakfast cereals, biscuits, pasta and rice-consumed in the UK using a sensitive LCMS technique with 13C-labelled internal standards. Phytoestrogens were detected in all foods analyzed; bread contained the highest amount of phytoestrogens-many as isoflavones-with an average content of 375 +/- 67 microg/100 g wet weight (excluding soya-linseed bread with 12,000 microg/100 g). Most other foods contained less than 100 microg/100 g, many as lignans. Our study shows that all foods analyzed contained phytoestrogens, with the highest amount found in breads, making them one of the main sources of dietary phytoestrogens in the UK.

"Determination of flavanols, theogallin","","Fermentation processes, which occur under the influence of multiplying microorganisms, lead to the creation of products with beneficial health properties. Due to the growing interest of consumers in beverages with health-promoting properties, new raw materials and their processing methods are being intensively studied to obtain products with improved functional values. The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of fermentation using SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) on the chemical composition, polyphenolic profile, and biological activity of apple and pear juices. The fermentation process caused a decrease in the content of polyphenols in apple juice from 1568.8 to 1269.0 mg/L, while in pears, an increase was observed from 492.9 to 576.7 mg/L. Statistically significant changes were observed in the content of individual groups of polyphenolic compounds. The fermentation process also influenced the increase in the value of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anticholinergic activity. This indicates that fermentation can be an effective process in increasing the biological properties of fruit juices. This fact can be used in the prevention of lifestyle diseases and in the production of functional foods with targeted health-promoting properties.","609.0"

"Betalain and phenolic compositions for four beetroot (Beta vulgaris) cultivars","","Red beetroot (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.) is a nutritionally rich root vegetable. It is a potential alternative raw material for pestil, a traditional fruit-based snack. This study aimed to develop a healthy beetroot-based pestil using traditional boiling (95 °C) and novel pretreatment methods, including thermosonication and microwave processing, with and without additional concentration steps. The effects of these methods on heat treatment period, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) formation, and the physicochemical, sensorial, nutritional, and chemometric profiles of pestils were evaluated. The beetroot-based snack formulated in this study was hedonically acceptable (≥5/9) and rich in essential minerals (Ca, K, Na, P, Mg) and trace elements (Zn, Fe, Mn), as determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Total antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) ranged from 113.11 to 870.78 mg Trolox<sup>®</sup> equivalent/100 g dry matter (DM). Total phenolic, flavonoid, and betalain contents varied between 220.6-313.8 mg gallic acid equivalent/100 g DM, 365.08-517.46 mg rutin equivalent/100 g DM, and 314.40-488.66 mg/kg, respectively. Major flavonoids identified and quantified included epicatechin, rutin, isoquercitrin, taxifolin, and quercetin, while major phenolic acids identified were chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, o-salicylic acid, p-coumaric acid, and vanillin, using liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Reducing the soluble solids content of the pestil pulp from 40 to 20 Brix degrees, in combination with thermosonication and microwave treatments, significantly shortened the processing time by 10-67%. This approach also reduced the HMF content to the limit of quantification (LOQ). Pretreatment methods significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) affected the levels of minerals and bioactive compounds in the pestils. These findings highlight the importance of process optimization to improve overall safety and the nutritional quality of the pestil.","611.0"
"Oxidative metabolism of the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein in humans in vitro and in vivo","11410004.0","The soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein are found in high concentrations in human plasma and urine after soy consumption. However, in vitro and in vivo data regarding the oxidative metabolism of isoflavones in humans are scarce. Therefore, we have studied the oxidative metabolites of these compounds formed in human liver microsomes and excreted in urine of male and female humans ingesting soy products for 2 days. Human liver microsomes transformed the soy isoflavone daidzein to three monohydroxylated and three dihydroxylated metabolites according to GC/MS analysis. On the basis of a previous study with rat liver microsomes and with the help of reference substances, these metabolites were identified as 6,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,3',4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,4'-trihydroxyisoflavone, 7,8,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, and 6,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. Significant amounts of the same metabolites except 6,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone were also found in urine of female and male volunteers after soy intake. Genistein was metabolized by human liver microsomes to six hydroxylation products. The main metabolites were the three aromatic monohydroxylated products 5,6,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone, 5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and 5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. The aliphatic monohydroxylated metabolite 2,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone and two aromatic dihydroxylated metabolites, 5,7,8,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone and 5,6,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyisoflavone, were formed in trace amounts. The same hydroxylated genistein metabolites except the aliphatic hydroxylated one could also be detected in human urine samples. Methylated forms of the catechol metabolites, which were generated by incubations with catechol-O-methyltransferase in vitro could be detected only in trace amounts in the urine samples. This implies that this reaction does not play a major role in the biotransformation of the hydroxylated daidzein and genistein metabolites in vivo. Most of these oxidative metabolites are described as human in vivo metabolites for the first time. Their biological significance remains to be established.","612.0"

Antioxidant capacity was assessed by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay, and flavonoid glycoside composition was quantified by HPLC and identified by GC. Total phenolics and antioxidant capacity were higher in raw than in cooked leaf extracts. The ORAC values were strongly correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.926) in all leaf extracts. The major flavonoids isolated from the leaf extracts were kaempferol-3-O-glycosides and quercetin-3-O-glycosides. C. aconitifolius leaves contained more varieties of the flavonoid glycosides than C. chayamansa. Cooking reduced antioxidant activity and phenolic content and resulted in losses of some kaempferol glycoside and quercetin glycoside residues in leaf extracts.

In this work, MS spectra were recorded at different voltage, to obtain structural elucidations in addition to molecular mass informations. The different response of the compounds identified has been also evaluated. MS characteristics of cis- and trans-piceid were determined on the basis of the response obtained with the ESI interface. The method allowed both the identification and determination of 24 phenolic compounds in 22 different commercial Sicilian red wines by direct injection, without any prior purification of the sample. The data on the levels of all the phenolic compounds in the red Sicilian commercial wines showed that the wine samples from Merlot grapes generally had the highest phenolic compounds content.","614.0"
"Effect of the year and storage on ascorbic acid content and total polyphenol content in three apple varieties","","Insufficient fruit intake is a major contributor to the development of non-communicable diseases, as the global average of daily fruit consumption remains far below the recommended levels. Apples are among the most widely consumed fruits worldwide, making them an ideal target for nutritional enhancement. Enhancing the content of health-promoting compounds within apples offers a practical way to increase bioactive intake without requiring major dietary changes. This review evaluates which of the 41 biologically active compounds considered in this article can reach physiologically relevant intake levels at the current average daily consumption of cultivated and wild apples. Comparative analysis shows that wild apples consistently contain higher concentrations of phenolic compounds and organic acids than cultivated varieties, in some cases by more than tenfold. At the average daily fruit intake of 121.8 g, wild species provide effective doses of epicatechins, anthocyanins, chlorogenic acid, and malic acid. In contrast, cultivated apples reach this level only for chlorogenic acid. Notably, less than 50 g of wild apple is sufficient to supply physiologically relevant amounts of several polyphenols. These findings highlight the potential of wild apple species as donors of bioactive compounds and provide a framework for breeding future apple cultivars that combine consumer appeal with enhanced health benefits.","615.0"
"Hydroxylated stilbenes in selected American wines","","The wine industry represents a significant economic sector; however, it generates large volumes of waste that can be valorized due to the presence of bioactive compounds, particularly stilbenes. These naturally occurring stilbenes exhibit remarkable potential in the prevention and treatment of various diseases, including cardioprotection, neuroprotection, antidiabetic properties, anti-inflammatory activity, and cancer prevention and therapy. This review discusses biosynthesis, structures, extraction methods, and mechanisms of action of stilbenes, with a particular emphasis on cancer prevention and treatment. Evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies demonstrate that stilbenes modulate multiple molecular pathways by promoting apoptosis, inhibiting cell proliferation, and regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolism. However, the clinical application of stilbenes is limited by their low bioavailability. To overcome this, pharmaceutical formulations have been developed to enhance their stability and bioavailability, reduce side effects, and improve target interactions. These advances are expected to increase the therapeutic efficacy of stilbenes. Furthermore, information on the health benefits of less common stilbenes remains limited, highlighting the need for further research on these compounds.","616.0"

"Quantitative determination of isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol in rat plasma by liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and its application to the pharmacokin","17154349.0","A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the quantification of quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin in rat plasma. After being treated with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase, the analytes were extracted by liquid/liquid extraction with the internal standard (IS; baicalein). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Diamonsil C(18) column with a mobile phase consisting of 2% formic acid/methanol (10:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min, with a split of 200 microL to the mass spectrometer. Validation results indicated that the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 1 ng . mL(-1). The assay exhibited a linear range of 1-200 ng . mL(-1) and gave a correlation coefficient of 0.9980 or better for each analyte. Quality control samples (1, 5, 20 and 100 ng . mL(-1)) in six replicates from each of three different runs demonstrated an intra-assay precision (RSD) of 1.1-8.9%, an inter-assay precision of 1.6-10.8%, and an overall accuracy (bias) of <13.4%. The extraction recovery of each analyte and internal standard was 70-80%. In the present study, we have investigated the pharmacokinetic profiles of isorhamnetin after oral application in rats equipped with a jugular catheter. After oral dosing of isorhamnetin, the mean values (n = 10) of C(max) were 57.8, 64.8 and 75.2 ng . mL(-1) which were achieved at a T(max) of 8.0, 6.4 and 7.2 h for oral doses of 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg . kg(-1) body weight, respectively. The corresponding mean values for isorhamnetin area under the curver (AUC) from 0 to 60 h were 838.2, 1262.8, 1623.4 ng . h . mL(-1). Our results further demonstrated that the samples analyzed showed isorhamnetin could not be transformed into quercetin or kaempferol in rats, indicating that the demethylation of the 3'-oxymethyl group of isorhamnetin does not occur in Wistar rats.","620.0"
"Alkylresorcinol content and homologue composition in durum wheat (Triticum dururm) kernels and pasta products","16608224.0","The total alkylresorcinol (AR) content and relative homologue composition of 21 durum wheat (Triticum durum) kernel samples, as well as 5 pasta products and the corresponding flour mixtures, were determined. Durum wheat contained on average 455 microg/g ARs, and the average relative homologue composition was C17:0 (0.4%), C19:0 (14%), C21:0 (58%), C23:0 (21%), and C25:0 (6.5%). The homologue composition was found to be relatively consistent among samples, with durum wheat being different from common wheat by having a higher proportion of the longer homologues. No differences in content or homologue composition were observed in pasta products compared to flour ingredients, showing that alkylresorcinols are stable during pasta processing. The ratio of the homologues C17:0 to C21:0 was < or =0.02 for whole grain durum wheat products, which is different from those of common wheat (0.1) and rye (0.9).","621.0"
"Effect of high pressure processing on the quality of acidified Granny Smith apple","","The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the physicochemical, nutritional and microbial quality of acidified Granny Smith (GS) apple purée processed on industrial-scale high pressure system during 3weeks of refrigerated storage (5°C±1°C). Two commercially feasible pressure treatments (400 and 600MPa/5min/20°C) and a mild conventional pasteurization at 75°C/10min, with pasteurization values of P ₇₀°C ⁷.⁵ =8.15min, were conducted and their effect on total vitamin C (total Vit C), ascorbic acid (AA) and total phenolic content (TPP), and on instrumental quality parameters (color, viscosity, soluble solids, titratable acidity and pH) were comparatively studied. Inactivation of indigenous microorganisms (total aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts and moulds and yeasts) of the apple product was also studied and monitored during storage. Total Vit C and AA contents were unaffected by the 400MPa and the mild pasteurization treatment. TPP content was not changed during processing at 400MPa, but was affected by the 600MPa and also slightly by the pasteurization treatment. Experimental data on the loss of total Vit C during storage were described with a first-order reaction kinetic and times of half loss between 9.3 to 10.3days could be estimated for the three studied processes. Storage provoked loss of TPP content and color deterioration of pressurized GS puree samples, which was attributed to enzymatic browning reactions. Microbial counts were reduced by the different preservation techniques below the detection limit (50cfug⁻¹) and storage revealed no further growth. Industrial relevance: This is one of the first studies applying commercial industrial-scale high pressure equipment for the pasteurization of an acidified apple purée product. The pressures of 400 and 600MPa with 5min holding time at ambient temperature render economically feasible processes with high throughput and productivity. In the European Union the most important fruits in terms of production are apples. Apple purée is a largely consumed preserve in many households and beside apple juice or cider is one of the most important apple products in the market. In contrast to traditional apple purée preparation, high pressure processing or mild thermal treatments could imply new opportunities for the apple processing industry in developing more fresh-like, value-added apple products with reasonable shelf life.","622.0"
"Antioxidant Capacities and Phenolics Levels of French Wines from Different Varieties and Vintages","11453773.0","Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Levels of phenolics, major catechins [(+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4], phenolic acids (gallic acid and caffeic acid), caftaric acid, malvidin-3-glucoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-glucoside were quantified by HPLC with UV detection for 54 French varietal commercial wines taken from southern France to study the antioxidant capacity and the daily dietary intake of these compounds for the French population. The highest antioxidant capacity was obtained with red wines and ranged from 12.8 mmol/L (Grenache) to 25.2 mmol/L (Pinot Noir). For white wines, Chardonnay enriched in phenolics by special wine-making was found to have an antioxidant capacity of 13.8 mmol/L, comparable to red wine values. For red wines classified by vintages (1996-1999) antioxidant capacities were approximately 20 mmol/L and then decreased to 13.4 mmol/L for vintages 1995-1991. Sweet white wines have 1.7 times more antioxidant capacity (3.2 mmol/L) than dry white wines (1.91 mmol/L). On the basis of a still significant French wine consumption of 180 mL/day/person, the current daily intake of catechins (monomers and dimers B1, B2, B3, and B4) averaged 5 (dry white wine), 4.36 (sweet white wines), 7.70 (rosé wines), 31.98 (red wines), and 66.94 (dry white wine enriched in phenolic) mg/day/resident for the French population. Red wine, and particularly Pinot Noir, Egiodola, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot varieties, or Chardonnay enriched in phenolics during wine-making for white varieties contribute to a very significant catechin dietary intake.","623.0"
"Levels of stilbene oligomers and astilbin in French varietal wines and in grapes during noble rot development","11902955.0","Phenolics from grapes and wines can play a role against oxidation and development of atherosclerosis. Stilbenes have been shown to have cancer chemopreventive activity and to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage. A method for the direct determination of stilbene oligomers (viniferin and pallidol) as well as astilbin in different types of wine using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection is described. In a survey of 21 commercial wines from the south of France, levels of pallidol and viniferin are reported for the first time in different types of wines. Viniferin was found to be present only in red and botrytized sweet white wines with levels between 0.1 and 1.63 mg/L; pallidol was not found in dry and sweet white wines but only in wines made by maceration with stems, with levels between 0.38 and 2.22 mg/L. Highest levels of astilbin were found in Egiodola (15.13 mg/L), Merlot (11.61 mg/L), and Cabernet Sauvignon (8.24 mg/L) for red wines and in Sauvignon (5.04 mg/L) for white varietal wines. Astilbin levels are highest for recent vintages, but pallidol is not found in older vintages. During noble rot development in Sauvignon or Sémillon grapes from the Sauternes area, levels of trans-astringin, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, and pallidol are quite low (<0.5 mg/kg of grapes). Viniferin and astilbin levels become optimum at 2 and 30 mg/kg, respectively, during spot grape and speckle grape stages.","624.0"
"Development of a stable isotope dilution analysis with liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry detection for the quantitative analysis of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in foods and model systems","16881674.0","A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative determination of the di- and trihydroxybenzenes catechol (1), pyrogallol (2), 3-methylcatechol (3), 4-methylcatechol (4), and 4-ethylcatechol (5) in foods by means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed. With or without sample preparation involving phenylboronyl solid phase extraction, the method allowed the quantification of the target compounds in complex matrices such as coffee beverages with quantification limits of 9 nmol/L for 4-ethylcatechol, 24 nmol/L for catechol, 3-methyl-, and 4-methylcatechol, and 31 nmol/L for pyrogallol. Recovery rates for the analytes ranged from 97 to 103%. Application of the developed SIDA to various commercial food samples showed that quantitative analysis of the target compounds is possible within 30 min and gave first quantitative data on the amounts of di- and trihydroxybenzenes in coffee beverage, coffee powder, coffee surrogate, beer, malt, roasted cocoa powder, bread crust, potato crisps, fruits, and cigarette smoke and human urine. Model precursor studies revealed the carbohydrate/amino acid systems as well as the plant polyphenols catechin and epicatechin as precursors of catechol and 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, caffeic acid as a precursor of catechol and 4-ethylcatechol, and gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and gallic acid as precursors of pyrogallol.","625.0"
"The phenolic fraction of maize bran: evidence for lignin-heteroxylan association","11397446.0","Maize bran heteroxylan samples were extracted in various conditions of severity. Their ferulate and diferulate content was investigated by GC-MS of methyl ester-TMSi derivatives. When extracted by 0.5 M NaOH in mild conditions, the heteroxylan sample contained a low level of ferulic acid (0.032% by wt.) and the main diferulate surviving alkaline extraction was found to be the 8-8' diferulate. On peroxidase treatment, this sample nevertheless produced a firm and brittle gel without any change in the diferulate profile. Typical lignin structures, mainly comprising syringyl units interconnected through beta-O-4, beta-1 and beta-beta interunit bonds, were evidenced in the maize bran sample. More importantly, these lignin structures were found to be tightly associated with the alkali-extracted heteroxylans. Thioacidolysis revealed the occurrence of 0.1-0.5% (by wt.) lignin structures in heteroxylan fractions extracted in mild or severe conditions, before and after purification of the polysaccharides. The gelling potential of the heteroxylan fractions was not only dependent on their ferulate level, but also influenced by associated lignin structures. These results argue for the occurrence of covalent linkages between heteroxylan chains and lignin structures which could participate in the peroxidase-driven gelation of feruloylated polysaccharides. They demonstrate the role of low lignin levels in the organization of native or reconstructed polysaccharide networks.","626.0"
"Anti-inflammatory properties of a pomegranate extract and its metabolite urolithin-A in a colitis rat model and the effect of colon inflammation on phenolic metabolism","19616930.0","Whether the beneficial effects of pomegranate are due to the ellagitannins or to their microbiota-derived urolithins is not known. Our objectives were to evaluate the effects of pomegranate intake and its main microbiota-derived metabolite urolithin-A (UROA) on colon inflammation and to assess whether UROA is the main anti-inflammatory compound. In addition, the effect of the inflammation on the phenolic metabolism was also explored. Male Fisher rats were fed with 250 mg kg(-1) day(-1) pomegranate extract (PE) or 15 mg kg(-1) day(-1) UROA for 25 days. Dextran sodium sulfate (5%) (DSS) was administered for the five last days and then rats were euthanized. DSS is a well-known model of inflammatory bowel disease. Colon tissue damage, microbiota changes, antioxidant status, prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), nitric oxide production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), gene expression (microarrays and RT-PCR) and polyphenol metabolism (LC-MS-MS) were evaluated. Both PE and UROA decreased inflammation markers (iNOS, cycloxygenase-2, PTGES and PGE(2) in colonic mucosa) and modulated favorably the gut microbiota. The G(1) to S cell cycle pathway was up-regulated in both groups. UROA group showed various down-regulated pathways, including that of the inflammatory response. PE, but not UROA, decreased oxidative stress in plasma and colon mucosa. Only UROA preserved colonic architecture. The normal formation of urolithins in PE-fed rats was prevented during inflammation. Our results suggest that UROA could be the most active anti-inflammatory compound derived from pomegranate ingestion in healthy subjects, whereas in colon inflammation, the effects could be due to the nonmetabolized ellagitannin-related fraction.","627.0"
"Spectrophotometric determination of tannins in tea and beer samples with iron(III) and 1,10-phenanthroline as reagents","2757233.0","A simple and accurate spectrophotometric method is proposed for the determination of tannins in tea and beer samples based on the reduction of iron(III) to iron(II) by tannins at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The iron(II) was then reacted with 1,10-phenanthroline at pH 4.4 to form a coloured complex. Background correction could be effected by precipitating the tannins in the sample solution twice with gelatin and kaolin. Absorbance measurements were made at 540 nm and the calibration graph was linear from 0 to 5.5 micrograms ml-1 of tannic acid with a slope of 0.213 A p.p.m.-1. The precision for the determination of tannins in a tea sample containing 9.45% of tannins was 1.8%. Most of the ingredients commonly found in tea and beer samples do not interfere with the determination. Several tea and beer samples were analysed for their tannin content using the proposed method.","628.0"
"Secoiridoids, tocopherols, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils extracted from destoned fruits","15713026.0","The effect of olive stone removal before processing on the degradation level, secoiridoid and tocopherol contents, and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied. EVOOs were extracted from olives of the Leccino, Moraiolo, Frantoio, Pendolino, Taggiasca, and Colombaia varieties both in the presence and in the absence of the stones. The degradation level of EVOOs was evaluated by acidity, peroxide number, and spectroscopic indices K(232) and K(270), according to EU regulation. The secoiridoid compounds typical of EVOO, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and tocopherols were analyzed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the xanthine oxidase/xanthine system, generating superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, and by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl test. Results showed that EVOOs obtained from both stoned and destoned olives had a very low degradation level, which was not affected by destoning. Destoning lowered slightly the alpha-tocopherol content in EVOOs but increased the total secoiridoid content and the antioxidant activity of EVOOs (up to 3.5-fold). However, these effects were variety-dependent and negligible in some conditions. It was concluded that a better knowledge of the reactions occurring during olive processing, and particularly on the involvement of endogenous pulp and stone enzymes, is essential to predict the effect of destoning on EVOO quality.","629.0"
"Effect of storage on secoiridoid and tocopherol contents and antioxidant activity of monovarietal extra virgin olive oils","16608222.0","The degradation of secoiridoid, tocopherol, and antioxidant activity in extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs) was studied during 8 months of storage in closed bottles in the dark, at 40 and 25 degrees C. Picual, Arbequina, Taggiasca, and Colombaia monovarietal EVOOs possessing quite different fatty acid and antioxidant contents were used. The secoiridoid aglycones, namely, the oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, and alpha-tocopherol decreased following pseudo-first-order kinetics. In all EVOOs oleuropein derivatives were less stable than the corresponding ligstroside derivatives and alpha-tocopherol. Accordingly, overall antioxidant activity decreased following pseudo-first-order kinetics, with rate constants ranging from 0.85 x 10(-)(3) to 4.1 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) at 40 degrees C and from 0.8 x 10(-)(3) to 1.5 x 10(-)(3) days(-)(1) at 25 degrees C. According to both the antioxidant activity and the hydrolysis and oxidation indices established by EU regulation to assess EVOO quality, Colombaia oil was the least stable, followed by Taggiasca, Arbequina, and Picual oils. Despite antioxidant degradation, EVOOs with high antioxidant contents were still ""excellent"" after 240 days of storage at 40 degrees C. These data led to the conclusion that the beneficial properties of EVOOs due to antioxidant activity can be maintained throughout their commercial lives.","630.0"
"Phenolic compounds in white grapes grown in New York","","Grapevine trunk diseases, such as Esca, Botryosphaeria dieback, and Eutypa dieback, are caused by various Ascomycota and Basidiomycota fungi that colonize wood and form internal lesions. Basidiomycota fungi, such as Fomitiporia species, are associated only with the trunk disease Esca, and are wood-decay fungi. Variation in the extent of lesion development among the fungal pathogens reflects a combination of fungal virulence and host susceptibility. To evaluate factors that may affect lesion development, we compared in vitro wood-decay abilities and tolerance of host secondary metabolites (cell-wall and soluble phenolic compounds) of four fungi that cause trunk diseases: Eutypa lata (Eutypa dieback), Fomitiporia polymorpha (Esca), and Diplodia seriata and Neofusicoccum parvum (Botryosphaeria dieback). Fungi were grown on autoclaved blocks of Vitis vinifera 'Merlot' wood for six months, to examine fungal colonization of wood cells and percentages of wood components remaining after decay. Fungi were also grown on medium amended with starch, pectin, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, tannic acid, gallic acid, magnesium sulfate, or grape wood powder, to determine cell wall-degrading enzyme activity and impacts on fungal growth. Lastly, to determine tolerance of phenolic compounds, fungi were grown in medium amended with piceid, rutin, epicatechin, or gallic acid. Our novel findings for F. polymorpha include its preferential degradation of hemicellulose and pectin (and detection of corresponding enzymatic activities), but no degradation of lignin, in spite of growth in lignin-amended media and detection of laccase, lignin peroxidase, and peroxidase activities. Together, these findings suggest F. polymorpha has characteristics of both brown-rot and white-rot fungi. The type of wood decay caused by D. seriata and N. parvum, based on their degradation of pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin (and detection of corresponding enzymatic activities), is characteristic of a soft rot, similar to that of E. lata. Unique among these three Ascomycetes was induction of N. parvum growth by piceid, rutin, epicatechin, and gallic acid, and efficient metabolism and/or detoxification of these phenolic compounds by N. parvum. As all four fungi metabolize components of the wood as substrate, and also can metabolize/detoxify host-defense compounds, a clearer understanding of their roles as wood-decay fungi might further research on managing the chronic wood infections.","631.0"

"Physicochemical characteristics of various peach cultivars","","Loquat (<i>Eriobotrya japonica</i>) is an important subtropical evergreen fruit tree of the Rosaceae family that possesses significant edible and economic value. The NAC transcription factor family, as plant-specific regulatory factors, not only participated in plant growth and development but also played crucial roles in fruit quality formation. Through genome-wide analysis, this study identified 117 <i>NAC</i> family members in loquat, which were phylogenetically classified into 14 distinct subfamilies. Chromosomal localization revealed that 114 genes were unevenly distributed across 17 chromosomes, while the remaining 3 were located in genomic scaffold regions. Collinearity analysis indicated that loquat <i>NAC</i> genes primarily underwent purifying selection and showed high homology with <i>NAC</i> genes from other Rosaceae species. Cis-acting element prediction analysis suggested these genes were extensively involved in various biological processes, including abiotic stress responses, hormone signal transduction, and growth regulation. Expression pattern analysis based on transcriptome data further uncovered differential expression characteristics of <i>NAC</i> genes across different loquat cultivars and fruit developmental stages. Notably, correlation analysis identified several <i>NAC</i> candidate genes that were significantly associated with fruit sugar-acid content. This study provided the first comprehensive and systematic characterization of the <i>NAC</i> gene family in loquat, establishing an important foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which NAC transcription factors regulate loquat fruit flavor quality.","635.0"

Average concentrations of major phenolics and vitamin C in six apple cultivars were as follows (mg/100 g of fresh weight of apples): quercetin glycosides, 13.20; procyanidin B(2), 9.35; chlorogenic acid, 9.02; epicatechin, 8.65; phloretin glycosides, 5.59; vitamin C, 12.80. A highly linear relationship (r (2) > 0.97) was attained between concentrations and total antioxidant capacity of phenolics and vitamin C. Relative VCEAC values of these compounds were in the order quercetin (3.06) > epicatechin (2.67) > procyanidin B(2) (2.36) > phloretin (1.63) > vitamin C (1.00) > chlorogenic acid (0.97).

"Localization of condensed tannins in apple fruit peel, pulp, and seeds","","Histolocalization and quantification of secondary metabolites established the occurrence of alkaloids, phenols and acetogenins in various plant organs of A. muricata at different stages of plant growth. Annona muricata L. possesses broad assemblage of ethno-pharmaceutical and therapeutic upsides ascribed to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Currently, the bioactivity is characterized by the production of acetogenins (ACGs), and also by the biosynthesis of alkaloids, primarily benzylisoquinolines derived from tyrosine and phenolic compounds. As a result of high variability of metabolite production in A. muricata, the present study evaluated the histochemical analysis of various plant parts at different developmental stages of growth. Presences of phytometabolites were determined using in-situ histochemical localization of alkaloids, phenolic compounds and acetogenins, while its estimation employing spectroscopic quantification techniques to understand structure, development, time-course deposition, content and distribution of secondary phytoconstituents. Study revealed distinct presence of secondary metabolites in cells and tissues of all plant organs in various intensities and patterns. Alkaloids and acetogenins occurred mostly in secretory cavities or idioblast cells while sparsely associated with other cells or tissues. Phenolic compounds emerged widely, with no confined distribution patterns occurring in storage cells and tissues. Quantitative analysis revealed highest accumulation of alkaloids, phenols and acetogenins in mature root-barks, mature unripe fruit rind and mature leaf respectively. Secondary metabolites generally occurred in young stages at low concentrations as compared to matured growth stages of plant parts. Such in-situ histochemical and biochemical approach will help in identifying the cells and tissues responsible for synthesis, storage and biological effects of potential secondary metabolites which could be further used for culturing and enhancing its production with biotechnological aids.","644.0"
"Urinary excretion of the main anthocyanin in lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, and its metabolites","19351112.0","In vitro trials have indicated various potential health effects of lingonberries ( Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Most of these studies have been performed with berry extract or juice, and the detailed chemical structures of active compounds in these products have not been elucidated. Lingonberry contains cyanidin-3-galactoside as its main anthocyanin. Absorption and metabolism of the compound is not fully understood, and no studies of anthocyanin metabolism have been performed with lingonberries. The aim of this study was to investigate the urinary excretion of cyanidin-3-galactoside and its metabolites in young and healthy subjects receiving a breakfast containing 300 g of lingonberries. A fast, selective, and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (uHPLC-MS/MS) method was optimized for the analysis of the anthocyanin metabolites in urine. Both intact cyanidin-3-galactoside and its methylated and glucuronidated metabolites were identified from urine samples. The two metabolites represented >50% of cyanidin excreted in urine. Maximal excretion appeared between 4 and 8 h after the meal. Also, the compounds were absorbed more slowly than reported previously in several studies.","645.0"
"Antioxidant properties of two apple cultivars during long-term storage","","<i>Chaenomeles japonica</i> (<i>Chaenomeles japonica</i> Thunb. Lindl. ex Spach.) is gaining increasing attention due to its high nutritional value and potential for industrial use. The development of new breeding clones (potential new cultivars) with improved morphological and chemical properties is essential for enhancing its commercial cultivation. In this study, the impact of ozone in its gaseous form and cold storage on the morphological and chemical properties of newly selected Polish clones of <i>Chaenomeles japonica</i> was determined. Breeding clone '3b/1' produced the largest fruits, with a significantly higher average weight of 99.8 g compared to other clones. Fruits of clones '3b/1' and '7d/8' had the greatest tolerance to mechanical damage, requiring the highest force and energy for puncture and showing the most extensive deformation. The highest ascorbic acid content was recorded in clone '4c/1' (117.3 mg·100 g<sup>-1</sup>), while clone '3b/1' had the highest total phenolic content, reaching 373.92 mg GAE·100 g<sup>-1</sup>. A 15 min ozone treatment led to an average increase of 5.3% in both ascorbic acid and total phenolic content. In contrast, cold storage for 60 days caused a reduction of approximately 29.66% of ascorbic acid. Clone '3b/1' appears to be the potential new Polish cultivar and an introduction for cultivation due to its large fruit size, their high mechanical tolerance and relatively favorable chemical composition.","646.0"
"Genetic and agronomic variation in arabinoxylan and ferulic acid contents of durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) grain and its milling fractions","","Total arabinoxylan (AXt), water-extractable arabinoxylan (WeAX) and ferulic acid (FA) from five cultivars of durum wheat (Triticum durum L.), grown under four different agronomic conditions were measured. Among the varieties analysed, AXt, WeAX and FA contents ranged between 4.07%-6.02%, 0.37%-0.56% and 0.784 mg/g-7.98 mg/g, respectively. High genetic and agronomic variability was detected for AXt, WeAX and FA. AXt and FA increased sharply in milling products for extraction rates above 60%. FA was quantified in durum wheat milling fractions. High concentrations of FA esterified to cell-wall arabinoxylans were found in the aleurone layer (69% of total FA), germ and seedcoat (26.6% of total FA). Only trace amounts were detected in the starchy endosperm (1.4% of total FA). A highly significant correlation appeared between AXt and FA contents.","647.0"

The content of total polyphenols (g/100g) was 0.23 +/- 0.03; 0.22 +/- 0.03 and 0.68 +/- 0.1 in peeled fruits and 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.47 +/- 0.04 and 1.2 +/- 0.12 in peels of peaches, pears and apples, respectively. Caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids and the total radical-trapping antioxidative potential (TRAP) values in peeled apples and their peels were significantly higher than in peaches and pears, respectively. Contrarary, no significant differences in the content of dietary fiber among the studied fruits were found. The content of all studied indices in peels was significantly higher than peeled fruits (p < 0.05 ). A good correlation between the total polyphenols and the TRAP values was found in all fruits. Diets supplemented with apples and to a less extent with peaches and pears have improved lipid metabolism and increased the plasma antioxidant potential especially in rats fed with added cholesterol. The highest content of biologically active compounds and the best results in the experiment on rats makes apple preferable for dietary prevention of atherosclerosis and other diseases.","649.0"
"Flavonoids in Pigmented Orange Juice and Second-Pressure Extracts","11087509.0","Flavanone glycosides (FGs) and polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) have been studied in pigmented orange (Citrus sinensis) juices and second-pressure extracts (SPEs) by high-performance liquid chromatography and diode array detector. Detection was performed simultaneously at two different wavelengths: 278 nm (for determination of FGs) and 325 nm (for determination of PMFs). Qualitative distribution patterns of FGs and PMFs in juices and SPEs were similar, although the quantitative results are quite different. An increased narirutin/hesperidin ratio after centrifugation and the presence of high amounts of PMFs in SPEs, which remain unchanged after centrifugation, were observed. Therefore, a simple and affordable procedure to distinguish an orange juice from SPEs was proposed.","650.0"
"Structural identification of two metabolites of catechins and their kinetics in human urine and blood after tea ingestion","","Tea is a popular beverage consumed worldwide. The metabolic fate of its major constituents, catechins, however, is not well-known. In this study, two catechin metabolites were detected in the urine and plasma of human volunteers after ingestion of green tea. These metabolites were identified by LC/ESI-MS and NMR as (-)-5-(3',4', 5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3', 4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6). The renal excretion of M4 and M6 had a 3 h lag time and peaked 7.5-13.5 h after ingestion of a single dose of green tea, while (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin peaked at 2 h. M4 and M6 were two major tea metabolites with urinary cumulative excretions as high as 8-25 times the levels of EGC and (-)-epicatechin in some of our subjects, and accounted for 6-39% of the amounts of ingested EGC and (-)-epicatechin. Both the metabolites appeared to be produced by intestinal microorganisms, with EGC and (-)-epicatechin as the precursors of M4 and M6, respectively. Repeated ingestion of green tea produced a slight accumulative effect of the metabolites. They were also detected in the plasma, exhibiting kinetics similar to those of the urinary metabolites, and in the feces. Study on these metabolites may help us further understand the cancer chemopreventive actions and other beneficial effects of tea.","651.0"
"Analysis of urinary metabolites of tea catechins by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry","11409941.0","Tea has been proposed to have beneficial health effects which have been attributed to the polyphenolic compounds known as catechins. The bioavailability and biotransformation of these compounds, however, are not clearly understood. In this study, we used liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-MS) to determine urinary glucuronidated and sulfated tea catechins and their metabolites (including methylated and ring-fission metabolites) based on the detection of deprotonated molecular ions and aglycone fragment ions. The compound resolution was achieved both chromatographically and mass spectroscopically. After green tea administration, the major conjugates appeared in human, mouse, and rat urine samples were identified as monoglucuronides and monosulfates of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin. We also found O-methyl-EGC-O-glucuronides and -O-sulfates and O-methyl-epicatechin-O-sulfates in human urine. (-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), the ring-fission metabolites of EGC and (-)-epicatechin, respectively, were also predominantly in monoglucuronide and monosulfate forms in the urine. In comparison to rats, the urinary metabolite profiles of tea catechins in mice resemble more closely to those in humans. This is the first report describing direct simultaneous analysis of multiple tea catechin conjugates in urine samples. This method will allow more thorough investigations of the biotransformation of tea polyphenols.","652.0"

The HPLC separation was carried out on a Waters Nova Pak C(18) column using acetonitrile and water as mobile phase after the sample of rat serum was cleaned up with solid-phase extraction. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in the negative ion mode and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) method was developed to determine the active components. Three flavonoids of hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin were identified in the serum by comparing their retention times and three independent SRM precursor/product ion transitions with those of corresponding reference standards. The concentrations of naringin, hesperidin and neohesperidin in rat serum determined by SRM measurement were 16.3, 11.9 and 14.3 ng/ml, respectively, after orally administrating the decoction of B. falcatum L. and F. aurantii. This method was validated in terms of recovery, linearity, accuracy and precision (intra- and interday variation). The recoveries from spiked control samples were 93.0, 89.3 and 91.2% for hesperidin, neohesperidin and naringin, respectively. Linearity in rat serum was observed over the range of 2.0-50.0 ng/ml. Percent bias (accuracy) and precision were well within the acceptable range and the relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of the measured rat serum samples was less than 10% (n=5).","653.0"
"Identification of nobiletin metabolites in mouse urine","16521176.0","Nobiletin, a major component of citrus polymethoxyflavones, has many potential significant health benefits. While the biological activities of nobiletin have been widely reported, its in vitro and in vivo metabolic fate has been rarely studied. To explore the biotransformation mechanism of nobiletin we conducted an investigation into its metabolic profile in mouse urine, by various analytical techniques. Due to sample amount limitations for isolating and characterizing an individual metabolite, two possible nobiletin metabolites were prepared in a similar multi-step organic synthetic route: 3'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (3'-demethylnobiletin) and 4'-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,3'-pentamethoxyflavone (4'-demethylnobiletin). Normal phase (silica gel) and C(18) reverse phase chromatography, as well as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry, were employed in the separation of 3'-demethylnobiletin and 4'-demethylnobiletin, however, without success due to the structural similarities of these mono-demethylated nobiletins. Using a chiral packed column eluted under supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) conditions, a clear separation was achieved. Thus, by comparing the SFC profiles of metabolite mixtures with the synthesized standard compounds, the major nobiletin metabolite of mouse urine is identified as 4'-demethylnobiletin, whereas 3'-demethylnobiletin is a minor metabolite. In this study, the concentration of 4'-demethylnobiletin in mouse urine is 28.9 microg/mL.","654.0"
"Polyphenolic profiles and antioxidant activities of heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. cordiformis) and Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.)","17032006.0","The polyphenolic compositions of three heartnut (Juglans ailanthifolia var. cordiformis) varieties (Imshu, Campbell CW1, and Campbell CW3) were examined and compared with those of two Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) varieties (Combe and Lake). The nuts were defatted, extracted, and separated into three different fractions, the free phenolic acid (FPA), acid-hydrolyzable phenolic acid (AHPA), and bound phenolic acid (BPA) fractions. The total phenolic contents (TPCs) in both FPA and AHPA of the Persian walnuts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of the heartnuts, but not in the BPA (P = 0.20). LC-ESI-MS(n)() studies revealed that except for the FPA fraction, the major polyphenolics in both heartnut and Persian walnut were ellagic acid and valoneic acid dilactone. Persian walnuts contained an average of 0.29 and 1.31 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the 80% methanol extractable fractions FPA and AHPA, respectively. Heartnuts contained an average of 0.16 and 0.60 mg of ellagic acid/g nut in the respective fractions. Bound ellagic acid in the residue was 0.93 and 0.70 mg/g of nut in the Persian walnut and in the heartnut, respectively. Valoneic acid dilactone was tentatively identified and quantified as milligrams of ellagic acid equivalent per gram of nut. These components were found to contribute to the strong total antioxidant activities measured using ferric reducing antioxidant power and photochemiluminescence methods.","655.0"
"Separation and determination of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside oligomers and their hydrolysates in the flaxseed extract by high-performance liquid chromatography","18272161.0","Flaxseed contains the largest amount of lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) oligomers and is the richest dietary source of SDG. SDG oligomers in the flaxseed extract are often hydrolyzed to break the ester linkages for the release of SDG and the glycosidic bonds for the release of secoisolariciresinol (SECO). The hydrolysates of SDG oligomers are complicated because of the production of esters in an alcohol-containing medium. In this study, a new gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed to be suitable for the separation and determination of: (1) SDG oligomers extracted from the defatted flaxseed powder by a 70% aqueous methanol solution; (2) SDG oligomers and their alkaline hydrolysates, including SDG, p-coumaric acid glucoside and its methyl ester, ferulic acid glucoside and its methyl ester in an alkaline hydrolytic solution; and (3) the succedent acid hydrolysates, including secoisolariciresinol monoglucoside (SMG), SECO, anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (anhydro-SECO), p-coumaric acid and its methyl ester, ferulic acid and its methyl ester, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) and its degradation product in an acid hydrolytic solution. The content of SDG oligomers in a defatted flaxseed powder was found to be 38.5 mg/g on a dry matter basis, corresponding to a SDG content of 15.4 mg/g, which was determined after alkaline hydrolysis. Furthermore, this study presented a major reaction pathway for the hydrolysis of SDG oligomers.","656.0"
"Estimation of black tea quality by analysis of chemical composition and colour difference of tea infusion","","The high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) was optimized for the simultaneous determination of 11 compounds, belonging to polyphenols (gallic acid and seven catechins) and methylxanthines (caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline). The results obtained for all the validation parameters of the HPLC-DAD method showed that the method is sensitive enough for routine analysis with basic chromatographic equipment, thus it has a significant potential to be highly applicable in common laboratory practice. The method was used in the analysis of 60 green tea infusions originating from four tea-producing countries. The dataset contributes to enhancing current data on green tea. The analysis of green tea extracts revealed significant differences depending on the origin of the samples. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was applied to test the accuracy of identification of the origin of the tea samples, based on the chemical composition of tea with a focus on polyphenolic compounds and methylxanthines analysed in this study.

"Daidzein and genistein content of fruits and nuts","11002128.0","Dietary phytoestrogens such as the isoflavones daidzein and genistein are thought to protect against chronic diseases that are common in Western societies, such as cancer, osteoporosis, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, there are concerns regarding the deleterious effects of hormone-like compounds, especially with respect to the development of infants. However, there is little information regarding the phytoestrogen content of foods, and therefore epidemiologic investigations of phytoestrogens are limited. As part of a study quantifying the consumption of phytoestrogens, the objective of this work was to assess the daidzein and genistein content of fruits and nuts commonly eaten in Europe. Eighty different fruits and nuts were sampled, prepared for eating, and freeze-dried. Daidzein and genistein were extracted from the dried foods, and the two isoflavones were quantified after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. Completeness of extraction and any procedural losses of the isoflavones were accounted for using synthetic daidzin (7-O-glucosyl-4'-hydroxyisoflavone) and genistin (7-O-glucosyl-4'5-dihydroxyisoflavone) as internal standards. Of the 80 foods assayed, 43 contained no detectable daidzein or genistein, at a limit of quantification of 1 microg/kg dry weight of food. Nine foods contained more than 100 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram wet weight, and 28 contained less than this amount. Currants and raisins were the richest sources of the isoflavones, containing 2,250 microg and 1,840 microg of the two isoflavones combined per kilogram of wet weight of food. Although fruits and nuts are not as rich in isoflavone phytoestrogens as are soy and other legumes, this is the first documentation of levels of daidzein and genistein occurring in these foods.","659.0"
"Extraction and quantification of lignan phytoestrogens in food and human samples","11078589.0","Dietary phytoestrogens have a number of biological effects, including endocrine disruption, antioxidant potential, and protein tyrosine kinase inhibition. Secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin are lignan phytoestrogens found in foodstuffs, especially flaxseed. Normally they are glycosidically linked to carbohydrates and in the large intestine are deconjugated from the carbohydrate portion by bacteria. The aglycone lignans can be further modified to form the mammalian phytoestrogens enterodiol, enterolactone, and enterofuran, which are absorbed into the body and excreted in urine. To assess the health implications of phytoestrogens in general populations, knowledge of the quantity in the foods eaten is necessary. This article describes a simple preparative procedure for the assay of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in foodstuffs after hydrolytic removal of any conjugated carbohydrate. The difficulties in the practical application of the assay procedure are illustrated and discussed. Analytical results indicating the concentration of secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, and shonanin in a number of foodstuffs are presented. Also, the mass spectral data of a putative mammalian phytoestrogen, called enterofuran, identified in urine are presented.","660.0"
"Composition of polyphenols in fresh tea leaves and associations of their oxygen-radical-absorbing capacity with antiproliferative actions in fibroblast cells","","The polyphenols in venous parts of the tea plant used in manufacture of tea products (young leaves, old leaves, and stem) were analyzed by HPLC. The young leaves (apical bud and the two youngest leaves) were found to be richer (2.7-fold) in polyphenols than old leaves (from the tenth to the fifth leaf). Also, the tea polyphenols were found to be higher (1.4-fold) in summer than in spring. Ten different types of commercial tea (manufactured tea), including unfermented, semifermented, and fermented tea, were analyzed for their polyphenol compounds, and it was found that both yields of solids in tea water extracts (TWEs) and the amount of (-)epigallocatechin 3-gallate (EGCG) in these products varied with different tea leaves and processing methods. Longjing tea (unfermented green tea) contained the highest concentration of EGCG and polyphenols, whereas Assam black tea (most fermented) contained the least. Longjing TWEs showed strong inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis in A-431 tumor cells. We also found that green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and EGCG strongly inhibited tumor cell DNA synthesis and peroxyl-radical generation. The evidence suggests that the strong antioxidative and antiproliferative activities of Longjing TWEs and GTPs are mainly due to the higher contents of tea polyphenols. EGCG (the major component of GTPs) showed strong inhibitory action on the growth of immortalized cells (NIH3T3) and tumor cells (S-180II) but almost no effect on the growth of normal cells (C3H10T1/2).","661.0"

The contents of catechins, gallic acid, and methylxanthines have been measured in infusions of a range of green tea, oolong tea, and pu-erh tea products sold and consumed in the China, Japan, and Taiwan. When 15 Chinese green tea and 13 Japanese green tea products were analyzed by the HPLC method, the mean levels of the total catechins, (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate, (+)-catechin, and caffeine were found to be very similar in these two groups, but other minor catechins such as (-)-epigallocatechin, (-)-epicatechin, and (-)-gallocatechin 3-gallate were found to be higher in Japanese green tea products, whereas (-)-epicatechin 3-gallate, gallic acid, theophylline, and theobromine were found to be higher in Chinese green tea products. Oolong tea products possessed lower levels of catechins, whereas pu-erh tea products contained negligible amounts of these constituents. The new HPLC method is rapid, reliable, and reproducible and should be highly recommended to tea industries for routine analysis of commercial tea samples.","662.0"

"Antioxidant properties of commercial soft and hard winter wheats (Triticum aestivum L.) and their milling fractions","","The total phenolic content (TPC), total antioxidant activity (TAA), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging capacity, inhibition of coupled oxidation in a β-carotene-linoleate model system, iron(II) chelation activity and inhibition of copper-induced oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein (hLDL) cholesterol of 80% ethanolic extracts of soft and hard winter wheat samples and their milling fractions, namely flour, germ, bran and shorts, were investigated. Soft wheat extracts examined demonstrated higher TPC and TAA compared to those of hard wheat extracts. The germ fraction possessed the highest TPC, followed by bran, shorts, whole grain and flour for both wheat types examined. The TAA of both wheat types showed similar results except that shorts performed better than bran in this assay. Free radical scavenging properties of whole grain and milling fractions of both soft and hard wheat samples were examined against DPPH radical. The germ and flour fractions demonstrated the highest and lowest DPPH radical scavenging activity, respectively, among wheat fractions. Wheat extracts were also efficient in preventing bleaching of β-carotene, which is also known to be free radical mediated. In the iron(II) chelation assay the flour extracts demonstrated excellent activity, while the germ extracts showed a weak activity. The trends were similar in both soft and hard wheat for the iron(II) chelation assay. Wheat extracts also inhibited copper-induced oxidation of hLDL. In LDL oxidation assay, wheat extracts performed better than the reference antioxidant, ferulic acid.

Phenolics extracted belonged to free, soluble esters and insoluble-bound fractions. Soluble esters of phenolics and insoluble-bound phenolics were extracted into diethyl ether after alkaline hydrolysis of samples. The content of phenolics was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent and expressed as ferulic acid equivalents (FAE). The antioxidant activity of phenolic fractions was evaluated using Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, reducing power, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, inhibition of oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and DNA, Rancimat, inhibition of photochemilumenescence, and iron(II) chelation activity. The bound phenolic content in the bran fraction was 11.3 +/- 0.13 and 12.2 +/- 0.15 mg FAE/g defatted material for hard and soft wheats, respectively. The corresponding values for flour were 0.33 +/- 0.01 and 0.46 +/- 0.02 mg FAE/g defatted sample. The bound phenolic content of hard and soft whole wheats was 2.1 (+/-0.004 or +/-0.005) mg FAE/g defatted material. The free phenolic content ranged from 0.14 +/- 0.004 to 0.98 +/- 0.05 mg FAE/g defatted milling fractions of hard and soft wheats examined. The contribution of bound phenolics to the total phenolic content was significantly higher than that of free and esterified fractions. In wheat, phenolic compounds were concentrated mainly in the bran tissues. In the numerous in vitro antioxidant assays carried out, the bound phenolic fraction demonstrated a significantly higher antioxidant capacity than free and esterified phenolics. Thus, inclusion of bound phenolics in studies related to quantification and antioxidant activity evaluation of grains and cereals is essential.","668.0"

Human urine metabolome modifications after single cocoa intake were explored in a randomized, crossed, and controlled trial. After overnight fasting, 10 subjects consumed randomly either a single dose of cocoa powder with milk or water, or milk without cocoa. Urine samples were collected before the ingestion and at 0-6, 6-12, and 12-24-h after test-meals consumption. Samples were analyzed by HPLC-q-ToF, followed by multivariate data analysis. Results revealed an important effect on urinary metabolome during the 24 h after cocoa powder intake. These changes were not influenced by matrix as no global differences were found between cocoa powder consumption with milk or with water. Overall, 27 metabolites related to cocoa-phytochemicals, including alkaloid derivatives, polyphenol metabolites (both host and microbial metabolites) and processing-derived products such as diketopiperazines, were identified as the main contributors to the urinary modifications after cocoa powder intake. These results confirm that metabolomics will contribute to better characterization of the urinary metabolome in order to further explore the metabolism of phytochemicals and its relation with human health.","669.0"
"Anthocyanin composition of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) and cabbage (B. oleracea L. var. capitata) and its stability in relation to thermal treatments","","Violet cauliflower and red cabbage were analysed for their anthocyanin profiles before and after thermal treatments. Anthocyanins are well-noted as healthy compounds due to their antioxidant properties. Samples were analysed for total anthocyanin content by using a spectrophotometric differential pH method. An MS-based method, combining high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was developed, aimed to separate, identify and quantify the main anthocyanin forms. The procedure involves a rapid and efficient pre-treatment of the samples by solid-phase extraction, followed by selective determination of all compounds in a single run analysis using HPLC-MS/MS. Structural information for the identification of compounds was obtained from their fragmentation patterns (MS/MS spectra). The compounds were separated by HPLC and detected in the multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM), which provides a high level of selectivity for targeting the analytes in vegetables. Cauliflower and red cabbage showed differences in their anthocyanin profiles: cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside was absent in cauliflower, while it was well represented in red cabbage, together with the characteristic anthocyanin of Brassica genus, cyanidin-3-sophoroside-5-glucoside. The p-coumaryl and feruloyl esterified forms of cyanidin-3-sophoroside-5-glucoside were predominant in cauliflower, while the sinapyl one was mostly present in red cabbage. Besides, the stability of cauliflower's anthocyanin profile was evaluated in relation to thermal pre-treatments. All thermal treatments, except microwave heating, drastically reduced total cauliflower anthocyanin content. The amount of individual anthocyanins was expressed as the percentage with respect to total anthocyanin amount, spectrophotometrically measured. Significant individual changes were observed after different thermal treatment with an isomer formation.","670.0"
"Thermal Treatment of Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) Increases the Antioxidant Content and the Inhibitory Effect on Human Neutrophil Burst","20187646.0","The aim of this study was to compare the amount and activity of phytonutrients in raw, grilled, and boiled eggplant fruit using chemical measures and a biological assay of oxidative bursts in human neutrophils. The thermally treated samples showed various changes in their chemical composition (dry matter, soluble solids, acidity, and the amount of alcohol insoluble substances) due to the cooking processes and were much richer in the main phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic and caffeic acids, which are known to be antioxidants. Consequently, their free radical scavenging activity was significantly higher, especially that of superoxide anion. The biological assay of oxidative bursts from human neutrophils in the presence of N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine confirmed the greater activity of extracts of the cooked eggplants with respect to raw eggplants. Successive extract dilutions showed a significant activity up to 1.25 microg/mL after cooking, while raw fruits resulted in an activity up to 10.00 microg/mL. These results showed that the thermal treatment commonly used before consumption can increase the content and biological activity of antioxidant compounds of eggplants.","671.0"
"A metabolite profiling approach to identify biomarkers of flavonoid intake in humans","19812218.0","Flavonoids are phytochemicals that are widespread in the human diet. Despite limitations in their bioavailability, experimental and epidemiological data suggest health benefits of flavonoid consumption. Valid biomarkers of flavonoid intake may be useful for estimating exposure in a range of settings. However, to date, few useful flavonoid biomarkers have been identified. In this study, we used a metabolite profiling approach to examine the aromatic and phenolic profile of plasma and urine of healthy men after oral consumption of 200 mg of the pure flavonoids, quercetin, (-)-epicatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate, which represent major flavonoid constituents in the diet. Following enzymatic hydrolysis, 71 aromatic compounds were quantified in plasma and urine at 2 and 5 h, respectively, after flavonoid ingestion. Plasma concentrations of different aromatic compounds ranged widely, from 0.01 to 10 micromol/L, with variation among volunteers. None of the aromatic compounds was significantly elevated in plasma 2 h after consumption of either flavonoid compared with water placebo. This indicates that flavonoid-derived aromatic compounds are not responsible for the acute physiological effects reported within 2 h in previous human intervention studies involving flavonoids or flavonoid-rich food consumption. These effects are more likely due to absorption of the intact flavonoid. Our urine analysis suggested that urinary 4-ethylphenol, benzoic acid, and 4-ethylbenzoic acid may be potential biomarkers of quercetin intake and 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, 4-O-methylgallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, and gallic acid may be potential markers of epigallocatechin gallate intake. Potential biomarkers of (-)-epicatechin were not identified. These urinary biomarkers may provide an accurate indication of flavonoid exposure.","672.0"
"Flavonoid quantification in onion by spectrophotometric and high performance liquid chromatography analysis","","Onion solid wastes (OSW) are a promising source of natural antioxidants with potential applications in food preservation. This study optimized pressurized liquid extraction parameters-ethanol concentration, liquid-to-solid ratio, temperature, and time-using response surface methodology to maximize the recovery of total polyphenols, total anthocyanins, and antioxidant activity. The optimal extracts yielded 37.02 mg GAE/g dw for total polyphenols and 592.73 µg CyE/g dw for total anthocyanins. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using the FRAP assay and the DPPH method. HPLC-DAD analysis identified quercetin, spiraeoside, and protocatechuic acid as major polyphenolic compounds. The optimal extract was encapsulated via spray drying using gum arabic as the wall material. Parameters such as encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, and process yield were evaluated. The encapsulated extract was incorporated into mayonnaise, and its effect on oxidative stability was monitored over 14 days. Results demonstrated significant antioxidant protection, comparable to synthetic preservatives such as potassium sorbate and butylated hydroxytoluene. This study highlights the potential of OSW-derived antioxidants as sustainable, natural additives for food systems.","673.0"
"Quercetin in onion (Allium cepa L.) after heat-treatment simulating home preparation","","Quercetin content in onion (Allium cepa L.), represented mainly by 3,4'-O-quercetin diglucoside (3,4'-Qdg) and 4'-O-quercetin glucoside (4'-Qmg), was examined in five cultivars before and after three cooking treatments (sauteing, baking, and boiling). Baking and sauteing produced a 7-25% gain in quercetin concentration, while boiling produced an 18% decrease in quercetin concentration. Ratios of 3,4'-Qdg to 4'-Qmg in tissues ranged from 1:1.3 and 1:1.7, and combined the two conjugates represented 89-90% of total flavonol content in treatment and raw control means indicating heat stability of the flavonols. Changes in flavonol concentrations as a result of cooking method were consistent across all five cultivars.","674.0"
"Nutrients and antioxidant molecules in yellow plums (Prunus domestica L.) from conventional and organic productions: a comparative study","14709018.0","Yellow plums (Prunus domestica L) conventionally and organically grown in the same farm were selected to study the influence of different agronomic practices on antioxidant vitamins (ascorbic acid, vitamin E, beta-carotene) and phenolics (total polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonols) concentration. Conventional plums were grown on tilled soil. Three organic cultivations were performed: tilled soil, soil covered with trifolium, and soil covered with natural meadow. Differences in macronutrients were marginal, whereas antioxidant vitamins and phenolic compounds concentration markedly differed among cultivations. Ascorbic acid, alpha-, gamma-tocopherols, and beta-carotene were higher in organic plums grown on soil covered with natural meadow. The highest phenolic acids content was detected in plums grown on soil covered with trifolium. Total polyphenols content was higher in conventional plums. Quercetin was higher in conventional plums, but myrecitin and kaempferol were higher in organic plums. Under the same cultivar and climate conditions, the type of soil management turned out of primary importance in influencing the concentration of health-promoting compounds.","675.0"
"Identification and determination of polyphenols in tea by liquid chromatography with multichannel electrochemical detection","","Tea, after water, is the most frequently consumed beverage in the world. The fermentation of tea leaves has a pivotal role in its quality and is usually monitored using the laboratory analytical instruments and olfactory perception of tea tasters. Developing electronic sensing platforms (ESPs), in terms of an electronic nose (e-nose), electronic tongue (e-tongue), and electronic eye (e-eye) equipped with progressive data processing algorithms, not only can accurately accelerate the consumer-based sensory quality assessment of tea, but also can define new standards for this bioactive product, to meet worldwide market demand. Using the complex data sets from electronic signals integrated with multivariate statistics can, thus, contribute to quality prediction and discrimination. The latest achievements and available solutions, to solve future problems and for easy and accurate real-time analysis of the sensory-chemical properties of tea and its products, are reviewed using bio-mimicking ESPs. These advanced sensing technologies, which measure the aroma, taste, and color profiles and input the data into mathematical classification algorithms, can discriminate different teas based on their price, geographical origins, harvest, fermentation, storage times, quality grades, and adulteration ratio. Although voltammetric and fluorescent sensor arrays are emerging for designing e-tongue systems, potentiometric electrodes are more often employed to monitor the taste profiles of tea. The use of a feature-level fusion strategy can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of prediction models, accompanied by the pattern recognition associations between the sensory properties and biochemical profiles of tea.","676.0"

"Effect of germination on legume phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity","","This work has studied the effects of varying germination conditions for beans, lentils and peas, at semi-pilot scale, on bioactive compounds such as flavonoid and non-flavonoid phenolic compounds. It has also evaluated the free radical scavenging activity of these samples. The legumes studied contain different hydroxybenzoic acids and aldehydes, hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives, flavonol glycosides, and flavan-3-ols and procyanidins. The results obtained indicate that germination modifies the quantitative and qualitative phenolic composition of legumes, and the changes depend on the type of legume and the germination conditions. These changes influence the functional properties of the legumes as consequence of the variation in antioxidant activity. Peas and beans undergo a significant increase in antioxidant activity after germination, whereas lentils show a decrease.","678.0"
"Phase II-Inducing, Polyphenols Content and Antioxidant Capacity of Corn (Zea mays L.) from Phenotypes of White, Blue, Red and Purple Colors Processed into Masa and Tortillas","21327968.0","White, blue, red and purple corns (Zea mays L.) were lime-cooked to obtain masa for tortillas. The total phenolics and anthocyanins content, antioxidant activity expressed as total reducing power (TRP), peroxyl radical bleaching (PRAC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and quinone reductase (QR) induction in the murine hepatoma (Hepa 1 c1c7 cell line) as a biological marker for phase II detoxification enzymes were investigated. Among the extracts prepared from raw corn varieties the highest concentration of total phenolics, anthocyanins, antioxidant index and induction of QR-inducing activity were found in the Veracruz 42 (Ver 42) genotype. The nixtamalization process (masa) reduced total phenolics, anthocyanins and antioxidant activities and the ability for QR induction when was compared to raw grain. Processing masa into tortillas also negatively affected total phenolics, anthocyanin concentration, antioxidant activities, and QR induction in the colored corn varieties. The blue variety and its corresponding masa and tortillas did not induce QR. Ver 42 genotype and their products (masa and tortilla) showed the greatest antioxidant activity and capacity to induce QR.","679.0"
"Polyphenolic compounds of plums (Prunus domestica)","","Plum vinegar represents a functional food product valued for its potential health benefits, largely attributed to its polyphenolic content. This study investigates the quality parameters of vinegars produced from five Romanian plum varieties (Centenar, Agent, Andreea, Anna Spath and Romanian Vanata), focusing on their physicochemical and phenolic profiles. Analyses included pH, total acidity, colorimetric evaluation, total polyphenolic content (TPC), antioxidant activity, and ATR-FTIR and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy. The vinegars exhibited pH values ranging from 3.2 to 3.7 and TPC values between 250 and 350 mg GAE/L during fermentation, with higher concentrations (up to 400 mg GAE/L) recorded post-aging. These findings support the potential of Romanian plum varieties as valuable raw materials for producing high-quality, polyphenol-rich fruit vinegars.","680.0"
"Analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography diode-array detection, time-of-flight mass spectrometry and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry","19222029.0","High-performance liquid chromatography/diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD), time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC/TOFMS) and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC/QIT-MS) were used for separation, identification and structural analysis of lignans in Schisandra chinensis and rat plasma after oral administration of the herbal extract. Six lignans in Schisandra chinensis extract were identified unambiguously by comparing the retention time, their characteristic ultraviolet (UV) absorption and accurate mass measurement. A formula database of known lignans in Schisandra chinensis was established, against which the other 15 lignans were identified effectively based on the accurate extract masses and formulae acquired by HPLC/TOFMS. In order to distinguish the isomers, multi-stage mass spectrometry (ion trap mass spectrometry, MSn) was also used. The fragmentation behavior of the lignans in the ion trap mass spectrometer was studied by the six lignan standards, and their fragmentation rules in MSn spectra were summarized. These deduced fragmentation rules of lignans were successfully implemented in distinguishing the three groups of isomers in Schisandra chinensis by HPLC/QIT-MS. By using the three different analytical techniques, 21 lignans in Schisandra chinensis were identified within 30 min. After oral administration of the extract, 11 lignans in rat plasma were detected and identified by comparing their retention time, characteristic UV absorption and accurate mass measurement of peaks in HPLC/TOFMS chromatograms of the herbal extract. Finally, HPLC/TOFMS fingerprints of Schisandra chinensis in vitro and rat plasma in vivo were established. It is concluded that a rapid and effective method based on three analytical techniques for identification of chemical components was established, which is useful for rapid identification of multiple components in Schisandra chinensis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, it can provide help for further pharmacology and action mechanism study of lignans in Schisandra chinensis.","681.0"

"A Simplified Method to Quantify Isoflavones in Commercial Soybean Diets and Human Urine after Legume Consumption","9162309.0","Fermentation may enhance the nutritional properties of foods by increasing metabolite bioactivity or bioavailability. This study explored the effect of fermentation on isoflavone bioavailability and metabolism. Isoflavone metabolites were tracked in foods and biospecimens of healthy adults after fermented soybean (FS) or non-fermented soybean (NFS) consumption in a randomized, controlled, crossover intervention study. The change in soybean isoflavones caused by fermentation resulted in faster absorption and higher bioavailability after consumption of FS. Although the urinary level of total isoflavone metabolites was similar after the consumption of the two diets, urinary genistein 7-O-sulfate was derived as a discriminant metabolite for the FS diet by partial least squares discriminant analysis. This study suggests that an isoflavone conjugate profile might be a more appropriate marker than total isoflavone levels for discriminating between the consumption of FS and NFS diets.","683.0"
"Chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant properties of potato tubers as related to nitrogen fertilisation","","Sweet potatoes (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i>) are highly profitable, contribute to food security, and their leaves rich in phytonutrients. This study examined the optimal leaf harvesting stage by harvesting newly formed leaves (leaves 1 to 5) to achieve the highest concentration of carotenoids, phenolic compounds, antioxidant properties and mineral content. Leaves of five purple-fleshed sweet potato genotypes '2019-11-2' and '2019-1-1', 'Purple-purple', and from the USA '08-21P' and '16-283P' were harvested based on tuber life cycle [vegetative 8 weeks after planting (VS-8WAP), tuber initiation (TIS-12WAP), and tuber maturation phases (TMS-16WAP)]. At the 8WAP stage, leaves of genotype '2019-11-2' had the highest concentrations of cyanidin-caffeoyl-sophoroside-glucoside (17.64 mg/kg), cyanidin-caffeoyl-feruloyl-sophoroside-glucoside (41.51 mg/kg), peonidin-caffeoyl-hydroxybenzoyl-sophoriside-glucoside (45.25 mg/kg), and peonidin caffeoyl-feruloyl-sophoriside-glucoside (24.47 mg/kg), as well as antioxidant scavenging activity. In contrast, 'Purple-purple' harvested at TIS-12WAP showed the highest concentration of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. Zeaxanthin, lutein, all trans-β-carotene, and cis-β-carotene are the most abundant carotenoids in genotype '08-21P' at VS-8WAP. As a result, local genotypes '2019-11-2' harvested at 8WAP and 'Purple-purple' harvested at 12WAP are potential sources of anthocyanins and caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. Conversely, USA's genotype '08-21P' at the VS-8WAP stage is an excellent source of carotenoids. The leaves of USA's '08-21P' genotype and the local '2019-11-2' genotype at TMS-16WAP exhibited the highest content of Fe and Mn, respectively. The study identified the optimal leaf stage for consumption of leaves and for use as a functional ingredient.","684.0"
"Flavonoid aglycons in foods of plant origin I. Vegetables","","The gut microbiota metabolizes flavonoids, amino acids, dietary fiber, and other components of foods to produce a variety of gut microbiota-derived metabolites. Flavonoids are the largest group of polyphenols, and approximately 7000 flavonoids have been identified. A variety of phenolic acids are produced from flavonoids and amino acids through metabolic processes by the gut microbiota. Furthermore, these phenolic acids are easily absorbed. Phenolic acids generally represent phenolic compounds with one carboxylic acid group. Gut microbiota-derived phenolic acids have antiviral effects against several viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. Furthermore, phenolic acids influence the immune system by inhibiting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α. In the nervous systems, phenolic acids may have protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, phenolic acids can improve levels of blood glucose, cholesterols, and triglycerides. Phenolic acids also improve cardiovascular functions, such as blood pressure and atherosclerotic lesions. This review focuses on the current knowledge of the effects of phenolic acids produced from food-derived flavonoids and amino acids by the gut microbiota on health and disease.","685.0"
"Flavonoid aglycons in foods of plant origin. II. Fresh and dried fruits","","The health-promoting activity of radish microgreens after consumption depends on their bioaccessibility and bioavailability. In this study, we compared the composition of phenolic compounds, their cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory activities in cell lines, and antioxidant properties of the undigested radish microgreens with their fractions obtained after simulated in vitro digestion in the stomach, as well as in the small and large intestine. The results have demonstrated higher levels of total phenolics (by 70.35%) and total hydroxycinnamic acids (3.5 times increase), an increase in scavenging efficiency toward ABTS<sup>•+</sup> and superoxide anion radicals, and an increase in the reduction potential (FRAP method) in the gastric bioaccessible fraction. In contrast, small intestinal digestion negatively affected phenolic content (a reduction of 53.30-75.63%), except for total hydroxycinnamic acids (3-fold increase). Incubation of the non-bioavailable fraction with bacterial enzymes led to further degradation. Undigested microgreens had no negative impact on Caco-2, HT-29, and SH-SY5Y cells' metabolism at 0.05-2 mg/mL, while all digested samples at 1 mg/mL revealed their cytotoxic potential. All samples used at a non-cytotoxic concentration showed protective activity against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and corticosterone-induced oxidative stress generation as well as reduced proinflammatory cytokines production.

"Polyphenol contents and antioxidant properties of beer","","This study examined the effects of malt roasting degree on the chemical composition, aroma profile, antioxidant activity, and sensory attributes of brewed beer. Roasting increased carbohydrate content, diastatic power, and Maillard products such as melanoidins and Amadori compounds, contributing to deeper color and enhanced antioxidant activity. Aroma profiling with an electronic nose revealed that roasting shifted key volatile classes, including esters, terpenes, pyrazines, and sulfur compounds. Light malt beer retained fruity esters (for example, ethyl hexanoate and cis-3-hexenyl acetate), whereas dark malt beer was enriched in Maillard-derived pyrazines and aldehydes (for example, 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, furfural, maltol) that impart roasted and caramelized notes. Liquid malt beer showed the greatest loss of monoterpenes (for example, γ-terpinene), indicating thermal degradation. These changes aligned with antioxidant capacity, as melanoidin- and pyrazine-rich profiles enhanced radical scavenging. Overall, roasting modulated sensory and antioxidant properties through Maillard-derived transformations, underscoring their impact on beer quality.","688.0"
"Seasonal variations of rosmarinic and carnosic acids in rosemary extracts. Analysis of their in vitro antiradical activity","","<i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i> L. compounds, especially its main polyphenolic compounds, <i>carnosic acid</i> (CA) and <i>rosmarinic acid (RA</i>), influence various facets of cancer biology, making them valuable assets in the ongoing fight against cancer. These two secondary metabolites exhibit formidable antioxidant properties that are a pivotal contributor against the development of cancer. Their antitumor effect has been related to diverse mechanisms. In the case of CA, it has the capacity to induce cell death of cancer cells through the rise in ROS levels within the cells, the inhibition of protein kinase AKT, the activation of autophagy-related genes (ATG) and the disrupt mitochondrial membrane potential. Regarding RA, its antitumor actions encompass apoptosis induction through caspase activation, the inhibition of cell proliferation by interrupting cell cycle progression and epigenetic regulation, antioxidative stress-induced DNA damage, and interference with angiogenesis to curtail tumor growth. To understand the molecular interaction between <i>rosemary</i> compounds (CA and RA) and a protein that is involved in cancer and inflammation, S100A8, we have performed a series of molecular docking analyses using the available three-dimensional structures (PDBID: 1IRJ, 1MR8, and 4GGF).

"Chemical composition and flavor of Ecuadorian cocoa liquor","12033823.0","The contribution of the chemical composition to the flavor of cocoa liquor from an Ecuadorian selfed population of clone EET 95 was investigated. Polyphenols, purine alkaloids, organic acids, and sugars were quantified, and the key sensory characteristics of cocoa were scored by a trained panel. Despite the short bean fermentation (2 days) commonly used for Arriba cocoa, acetic acid content was closely correlated to liquor pH, demonstrating its essential role in cocoa liquor acidification. Polyphenols were positively correlated to astringency, bitterness, and the green note and negatively correlated to the fruity character. Alkaloid and polyphenol levels fluctuated significantly within the selfed progeny and tended to be lower than those of the heterozygous clone EET 95 (inbreeding effect). These results support the idea that polyphenols might be essential to the overall perception of cocoa liquor characteristics and indicate that the composition and the sensory quality of cocoa liquor are the result of both a genotypic contribution and the conditions of fermentation and roasting.","690.0"
"Influence of sample preparation on assay of phenolic acids from eggplant","16390175.0","Sample preparation is often overlooked and is frequently considered as ""a means to an end"". This systematic study with a phenolic-enriched substrate, eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), was undertaken to evaluate the substantial variations in the extraction techniques, solvents, and parameters as described in the published literature. Direct comparison of over 10 extraction procedures or conditions was performed to show the importance and influence of sample preparation on the assay of phenolic compounds. Chlorogenic acid (CA) was the most abundant phenolic acid accounting for >75% of the total phenolic acids content extracted from the eggplant sample. Optimum extraction of CA and total phenolics (TP) from Black Bell cultivar of eggplant were obtained when extractions were performed with a mixture of MeOH/H2O at a ratio of 80:20% v/v using a pressurized liquid extractor (PLE) at 100 degrees C. The amount of CA and TP extracted from eggplant by the previously reported procedures using a wrist shaker, rotary shaker, stirring, sonication, or reflux with different extraction solvents (acetone or varying composition of MeOH/H2O solvent mixtures) varied significantly between 5 and 95% as compared to PLE. The predominant phenolic acids in the free phenolic acid fraction of Black Beauty cultivar of eggplant were CA isomers. However, caffeic acid isomers were the major phenolic acids extracted from the base-hydrolyzed fraction.

Systematic sequential hydrolysis of a model Black bean (Eclipse variety) showed an insignificant amount of free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and water (85:15,%v/v) containing 10% acetic acid. The majority of phenolic acids were extracted from the base hydrolyzed fraction, and further sequential acid hydrolysis of the same extract did not yield any additional amounts of phenolic acid. Therefore all bean samples were ground and hydrolyzed with base in the presence of ascorbic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and the free phenolic acids were extracted with ethyl acetate and analyzed by HPLC. Ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid and sinapic acid were detected and quantified in all varieties. However, caffeic acid was detected in measurable amount only in two Black bean varieties (T-39 and Eclipse). The average phenolic acid content of dry bean sample was determined to be 31.2 mg/100 g. Total phenolic acid content among all samples varied between 19.1 and 48.3 mg/100 g of bean samples. Ferulic acid was the most abundant phenolic acid present in all samples, whereas intermediate levels of p-coumaric acid and sinapic acid were extracted from all bean samples.

"A systematic approach for extraction of phenolic compounds using parsley (Petroselinum crispum) flakes as a model substrate","","The impact of extraction methodology and polarity of extraction solvents on the assay of phenolic compounds was investigated using parsley (Petroselinum crispum) flakes as a model substrate. This systematic study was undertaken to address substantial variations in the extraction procedures, solvents and conditions as described in the recent literature. Five different extraction procedures [shaking, vortex mixing, sonication, stirring and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE)] and three different solvents (methanol, ethanol and acetone), with five different solvent to water ratios per solvent, were used for extraction. Extracts were analyzed for phenolic content by high-performance liquid chromatography and Folin-Ciocalteu assays. The yields of phenolic compounds extracted with a pressurized liquid extractor were comparable to or better than those of four classical extraction procedures. Optimum extraction efficiency with PLE was obtained when extractions were performed with four extraction cycles using ethanol-water (50:50, v/v). The amount of apiin (4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone 7-apiosylglucoside) and malonylapiin (apigenin malonylapiosylglucoside) isolated from parsley varied with the composition of extraction solvent. Apiin extractability was found to be a maximum when the solvent (ethanol, methanol or acetone) to water ratio was 30:70 (v/v), whereas higher amounts of malonylapiin were isolated with a reverse solvent to water ratio (70:30, v/v). Malonylapiin was not detected when parsley samples were extracted with organic solvent to water ratios of 10:90 (v/v) and 30:70 (v/v).","693.0"
"Chemical composition and antioxidant properties of mature and baby artichokes (Cynara scolymus L.), raw and cooked","","Artichoke is a traditionally consumed vegetable in many countries. In the past decade, the immature (baby) variety has been successfully introduced in the international food markets. The aim of this study is to compare the chemical composition and antioxidant properties of mature and baby artichokes, in raw state and after cooking. For this purpose, the proximate chemical analysis was estimated, and aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts were obtained to determine the contents of total polyphenols, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and cynarin. Proximate analysis revealed that cooking increased proteins and lipids in baby artichokes (p<0.05). The total phenolics content was similar in mature and baby artichokes and increased after cooking (p<0.05). Cooked baby artichokes exhibited the highest total phenolics, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and cynarin contents, as well as free radical scavenging capacity, measured as DPPH. Our results show that baby artichokes exhibit higher scavenging capacity than mature artichokes, and thus they constitute a particularly interesting source of putative antioxidant polyphenols, a quality that is improved by the application of thermal treatment.","694.0"
"Antioxidant actions and phenolic and vitamin C contents of common Mauritian exotic fruits","","Star fruit (<i>Averrhoa carambola</i>), a popular fruit in many parts of the world, is considered to have many beneficial nutritional and medicinal effects. However, harmful nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effects have also been described. In this review, we have discussed the reported beneficial effects of star fruit, explored the potential mechanisms for such beneficial effects, and outline factors that may affect the safe level of consumption. The beneficial effects include the following: antioxidant (mediated via L-ascorbic acid, epicatechin, and gallic acid), hypoglycemic (mediated via high fiber levels and 2-dodecyl-6-methoxycyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione), hypotensive (mediated via apigenin), hypocholesterolemic (mediated via micronized fiber), anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, antitumor effects, and immune-boosting effects. The presence of chronic kidney disease, gastroenteropathies, chronic pancreatitis, dehydration, consumption on an empty stomach, and higher concentration of oxalate in fruit/juice consumed predisposes to toxicity. The level of ingestion at which the beneficial effects transition to nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity is still to be accurately ascertained. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of star fruit ingested and the severity of toxicity is not certain and warrants further study.","695.0"
"Characterization of the antioxidant functions of flavonoids and proanthocyanidins in Mauritian black teas","","Tea drinking is associated with an improved antioxidant status in vivo which may contribute to the lowering of the risk of certain types of cancer, coronary heart disease and stroke. The polyphenolic bioactive composition and the antioxidant properties of Mauritian commercial black and fresh tea leaves were evaluated. Hot water infusates contained high levels of total phenols, total proanthocyanidins and total flavonoids. The concentrations of individual compounds, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epicatechin 3-gallate, epigallocatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin 3-gallate, gallic acid, and procyanidin dimers B1 and B2 were high. The ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays were used to assess the antioxidant potential of tea infusates with the following order of potency: Ouvagalia tea > Buccaneer's choice > Black Label > Red Label > Extra > Corson > Chartreuse > La Flora > 3-Pavillons. Linear regression analyses indicated high correlation coefficient with total proanthocyanidin (TEAC r = 0.96 and FRAP r = 0.95) and total phenol contents (TEAC r = 0.90 and FRAP r = 0.92) in infusates. Catechins and gallic acid significantly contributed to the overall antioxidant capacity of black tea extracts. In general, the fresh tea leaves had high levels of total phenols, total flavonoids, total proanthocyanidin and exhibited greater antioxidant potentials when compared with black teas. Thus Mauritian black teas and fresh tea leaves can be rich sources of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidants, which may be highly relevant to the maintenance of normal health and disease management, an observation that has led to the commencement of a clinical trial study to assess cardiovascular health in Mauritius.","696.0"
"Resveratrol in raw and baked blueberries and bilberries","13129286.0","Resveratrol in the fruits of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.), the lowbush ""wild"" blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), the rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade), and the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) were measured using a new assay based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-MS/MS assay provided lower limits of detection than previous methods for resveratrol measurement, 90 fmol of trans-resveratrol injected on-column, and a linear standard curve spanning >3 orders of magnitude. The recoveries of resveratrol from blueberries spiked with 1.8, 3.6, or 36 ng/g were 91.5 +/- 4.5, 95.6 +/- 6.5, and 88.0 +/- 3.6%, respectively. trans-Resveratrol but not cis-resveratrol was detected in both blueberry and bilberry samples. The highest levels of trans-resvertatrol in these specimens were 140.0 +/- 29.9 pmol/g in highbush blueberries from Michigan and 71.0 +/- 15.0 pmol/g in bilberries from Poland. However, considerable regional variation was observed; highbush blueberries from British Columbia contained no detectable resveratrol. Because blueberries and bilberries are often consumed after cooking, the effect of baking on resveratrol content was investigated. After 18 min of heating at 190 degrees C, between 17 and 46% of the resveratrol had degraded in the various Vaccinium species. Therefore, the resveratrol content of baked or heat-processed blueberries or bilberries should be expected to be lower than in the raw fruit. Although blueberries and bilberries were found to contain resveratrol, the level of this chemoprotective compound in these fruits was <10% that reported for grapes. Furthermore, cooking or heat processing of these berries will contribute to the degradation of resveratrol.","697.0"
"LC/MS/MS quantitation assay for pharmacokinetics of naringenin and double peaks phenomenon in rats plasma","16289985.0","A highly sensitive and specific electrospray ionization (ESI) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for quantitation of naringenin (NAR) and an explanation for the double peaks phenomenon was developed and validated. NAR was extracted from rat plasma and tissues along with the internal standard (IS), hesperidin, with ethyl acetate. The analytes were analyzed in the multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode as the precursor/product ion pair of m/z 273.4/151.3 for NAR and m/z 611.5/303.3 for the IS. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 5-2500 ng/mL. The lower limit quantification was 5 ng/mL, available for plasma pharmacokinetics of NAR in rats. Accuracy in within- and between-run precisions showed good reproducibility. When NAR was administered orally, only little and predominantly its glucuronidation were into circulation in the plasma. There existed double peaks phenomenon in plasma concentration-time curve leading to the relatively slow elimination of NAR in plasma. The results showed that there was a linear relationship between the AUC of total NAR and dosages. And the double peaks are mainly due to enterohepatic circulation.","698.0"

UV-visible spectrometry was a valuable tool for the identification of the class of the phenolic compound, whereas MS and MS-MS fragmentation data were useful for further structural characterization. Distinct similarities were found in the relative distribution of conjugated forms of phenolic compounds among the four currants. Phenolic acids were found mainly as hexose esters. Flavonol glycosides and anthocyanin pigments were mainly found as 3-O-rutinosides and second as 3-O-glucosides. However, cyanidin 3-O-sambubioside and quercetin hexoside-malonate were notable phenolic compounds in red currant. Flavonol hexoside-malonates were identified and quantified in the berries of currants for the first time.","699.0"
"Identification and quantification of phenolic compounds in berries of Fragaria and Rubus species (family Rosaceae)","15453684.0","High-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometric detection was used to study soluble and insoluble forms of phenolic compounds in strawberries, raspberries (red and yellow cultivated and red wild), arctic bramble, and cloudberries. Hydroxycinnamic acids were present as free forms in cloudberries and mainly as sugar esters in the other berries. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the typical flavonol glycoside in all of the berries studied. The composition of the predominant anthocyanins can be used to distinguish the studied red Rubus species from each other since cyanidin was glycosylated typically with 3-sophorose (56%) in cultivated red raspberry, with 3-sophorose (30%) and 3-glucose (27%) in wild red raspberry, and with 3-rutinose (80%) in arctic bramble. Ellagic acid was present as free and glycosylated forms and as ellagitannins of varying degrees of polymerization. Comparable levels of ellagitannins were obtained by the analysis of soluble ellagitannins as gallic acid equivalents and by the analysis of ellagic acid equivalents released by acid hydrolysis of the extracts.","700.0"
"Antioxidant in mango (Mangifera indica L.) pulp","","This work was carried out to investigate the pulp composition of four mango cultivars (Haden, Tommy Atkins and Ubá) at the ripening stage in relation to three components with antioxidant potential (total phenolics, carotenoids and ascorbic acid). Total phenolic compound content was estimated by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and total carotenoid content by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. The contents of beta-carotene and total vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid) were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography. Differences were found among the four mango cultivars in all the components analyzed. The content of phenolic compounds ranged from 48.40 (Haden) to 208.70 mg/100 g (Ubá); total carotenoid from 1.91 (Haden) to 2.63 mg/100 g (Palmer); beta-carotene from 661.27 (Palmer) to 2,220 microg/100 g (Ubá) and total ascorbic acid ranged from 9.79 (Tommy Atkins) to 77.71 mg/100 g (Ubá).

"Natural occurrence of free anthocyanin aglycones in beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)","","The application of an improved method of extraction and purification has allowed the characterization of anthocyanins and free anthocyanidins in beans, Phaseolus vulgaris L. using LC-MS determination. HPLC analysis of the final extract showed the existence of seven compounds when 520 nm was the selected wavelength. Major peaks were identified, according to their retention times and UV-Vis spectra, as cyanidin and pelargonidin monoglucosides when they were compared to those of the in-house library. Taking into account mass spectrometric data, together with elution time and spectral features, it was possible to identify peaks corresponding to cyanidin and pelargonidin diglucosides. As far as we know, these anthocyanins have not been detected in P. vulgaris L. before. The last three peaks in the chromatograms were thought to be acylated anthocyanins, due to their smaller polarity. However, MS spectra showed signals at m/z 287, 301 and 271, which would be in accordance with molecular ions corresponding to anthocyanidins: cyanidin, peonidin and pelargonidin, respectively. Moreover, these compounds had the same retention times and UV-Vis spectral features as those of aglycones arising from acid hydrolysis of the final extract. These results demonstrate, for the first time, the presence, in natural form, of free aglycones in vegetable samples. Until now, the bibliographical data have indicated that, in nature, this type of compound is only found in heteroside forms.","702.0"
"Antioxidant activity of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)","","Although the impact of postharvest trans-2-hexenal (E2H) application in maintaining the quality of horticultural products has been widely studied, its effect on fresh common beans and the preservation mechanism remain unexplored. In this study, the impacts of E2H on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell wall metabolisms, and lignin biosynthesis in common beans were investigated. Fresh common beans fumigated with E2H (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 μL L<sup>-1</sup>) were stored at 20 ± 1 °C for 12 days. Results showed that 1.0 μL L<sup>-1</sup> E2H remarkedly repressed the decline of chlorophyll content to delay the yellowing, maintained ROS homeostasis, modulated cell wall metabolism-related enzyme activities to regulate cell wall components, and inhibited lignin biosynthesis-related enzyme activities to reduce lignin accumulation, thereby alleviating softening and lignification in common beans. These findings indicated that E2H could improve antioxidant activity, delay softening, and attenuate lignification to mitigate the quality deterioration in common beans.","703.0"
"Determination of proanthocyanidins and catechins in beer and barley by high-performance liquid chromatography with dual-electrode electrochemical detection","8067536.0","A method was developed to determine the flavanols prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin B3, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin by high-performance liquid chromatography, using dual-channel electrochemical detection. This method was especially suited to the direct analysis of beer samples and to analysis of acetone extracts of barley samples, and was capable of determining proanthocyanidins and catechins at levels of 0.1-5.0 mg l-1. The use of dual-channel electrochemical detection also enabled unambiguous peak identification by measurement of collection efficiencies. This method offered improved sensitivity and selectivity compared with ultraviolet detection, and sample preparation procedures were greatly simplified.

The ECs were characterized with regard to the physical parameters, amount of total solids, total solids on filtrate, lipids, caffeine, trigonelline, and chlorogenic acids by HPLC, and sensory descriptive analysis related to foam appearance, taste, and mouthfeel. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate the EC samples. Arabica and Robusta samples were separated successfully by principal component 1 (55.3% of variance) including physicochemical and sensory parameters related to foam and taste of ECs. Torrefacto and Robusta Natural EC samples were separated by principal component 2 (20.7% of total variance) including mouthfeel and other attributes of color foam.

"Antioxidant activity of barley and malt: relationship with phenolic content","","This study examined the effects of malt roasting degree on the chemical composition, aroma profile, antioxidant activity, and sensory attributes of brewed beer. Roasting increased carbohydrate content, diastatic power, and Maillard products such as melanoidins and Amadori compounds, contributing to deeper color and enhanced antioxidant activity. Aroma profiling with an electronic nose revealed that roasting shifted key volatile classes, including esters, terpenes, pyrazines, and sulfur compounds. Light malt beer retained fruity esters (for example, ethyl hexanoate and cis-3-hexenyl acetate), whereas dark malt beer was enriched in Maillard-derived pyrazines and aldehydes (for example, 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, furfural, maltol) that impart roasted and caramelized notes. Liquid malt beer showed the greatest loss of monoterpenes (for example, γ-terpinene), indicating thermal degradation. These changes aligned with antioxidant capacity, as melanoidin- and pyrazine-rich profiles enhanced radical scavenging. Overall, roasting modulated sensory and antioxidant properties through Maillard-derived transformations, underscoring their impact on beer quality.","710.0"
"Domestic processing of onion bulbs (Allium cepa) and asparagus spears (Asparagus officinalis): effect on flavonol content and antioxidant status","11453754.0","Two commonly consumed plant foods, onion bulbs and asparagus spears, were subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping, maceration, and boiling. The impact of these processes on flavonol content was assessed. Further, the consequences of these processes on the antioxidant capacity of the tissues were evaluated with the beta-carotene bleaching method. Chopping significantly affected rutin content in asparagus, yielding an 18.5% decrease in 60 min; but in onions, quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside (Q(DG)) and quercetin 4'-glucoside (Q(MG)) were virtually unaffected by chopping. Boiling for 60 min had more severe effects, as it caused overall flavonol losses of 20.6 and 43.9% in onions and asparagus, respectively. Chopping of tissues did not considerably influence the antioxidant capacity, but boiling did provoke notable changes.","711.0"
"The effect of polyphenolic composition as related to antioxidant capacity in white wines","","Polyphenols, a diverse group of phytochemicals, are an indispensable component of the antioxidant defense system, given their capacity to neutralize free radicals and modulate redox reactions. This review examines the chemical diversity and antioxidant potential of polyphenols derived from viticultural byproducts, including grape skins, seeds, pomace, and stems. These biomass sources provide a sustainable reservoir of bioactive compounds with potential applications in the development of functional and biobased materials. This review also addresses the methodological challenges inherent to this field, such as the variability of extraction procedures and test conditions. This study critically examines the influence of the structural characteristics of polyphenols, including the number, nature, and distribution of hydroxyl groups as well as molecular size, on antioxidant activity. Additionally, innovative extraction techniques that enhance yield and bioactivity are presented and evaluated. Besides conventional monomeric and oligomeric polyphenolic compounds, lignins, a class of high-molecular-weight polyphenols of industrial importance and stability in oxidative environments, are addressed. The results underscore the necessity for standardized multiassay approaches to precisely assess antioxidant capacity and facilitate targeted polyphenol application in diverse fields. Future research should address the intricate interplay between biomass composition, extraction parameters, and polyphenol functionality to tailor their utilization.","712.0"
"Free and conjugated phenolic acids and aldehydes in potato tubers","","Multiple sensorial, technological, and nutritional challenges must be overcome when developing plant-based fermented dairy alternatives (PBFDA) to mimic their dairy counterparts. The elimination of plant-derived off-flavors (green, earthy, bitter, astringent) and the degradation of antinutrients are crucial quality factors highlighted by the industry for their effect on consumer acceptance. The adaptation of plant-derived lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species into plant niches is relevant when developing starter cultures for PBFDA products due to their evolutionary acquired ability to degrade plant-based undesirable compounds (off-flavors and antinutrients). Some plant-isolated species, such as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Limosilactobacillus fermentum, have been associated with the degradation of phytates, phenolic compounds, oxalates, and raffinose-family oligosaccharides (RFOs), whereas some animal-isolated species, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus strains, can metabolize phytates, RFOs, saponins, phenolic compounds, and oxalates. Some proteolytic LAB strains, such as Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, have been characterized to degrade phytates, protease inhibitors, and oxalates. Other species have also been described regarding their abilities to biotransform phytic acid, RFOs, saponins, phenolic compounds, protease inhibitors, oxalates, and volatile off-flavor compounds (hexanal, nonanal, pentanal, and benzaldehyde). In addition, we performed a blast analysis considering antinutrient metabolic genes (42 genes) to up to 5 strains of all qualified presumption of safety-listed LAB species (55 species, 240 strains), finding out potential genotypical capabilities of LAB species that have not conventionally been used as starter cultures such as Lactiplantibacillus pentosus, Lactiplantibacillus paraplantarum, and Lactobacillus diolivorans for plant-based fermentations. This review provides a detailed understanding of genes and enzymes from LAB that target specific compounds in plant-based materials for plant-based fermented food applications.","713.0"
"Determination of chlorogenic acid in potato tubers","","Potato peel represents a major by-product of the potato-processing industry and a promising source of bioactive compounds with potential health benefits. This study investigates the biochemical and nutritional composition of peels from five purple and two red potato cultivars, with particular attention to their phytochemical profiles and antioxidant properties. Total phenolic content, carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids were quantified using UV-visible spectrophotometry. The phytochemical composition was further characterized via High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with a Diode-Array Detector (HPLC-DAD). Antioxidant and radical-scavenging capacities of the extracts were assessed through Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. Significant variability was observed across cultivars for all measured parameters. While all samples were rich in carbohydrates and proteins, they shared a common phenolic profile dominated by chlorogenic acid and its derivatives, as well as caffeic acid. Anthocyanin composition, however, was highly cultivar-specific. Notably, all extracts demonstrated strong antioxidant and antiradical activities, in agreement with their high total phenolic content. These findings highlight the potential of red and purple potato peels as valuable sources of functional ingredients for food and nutraceutical applications.","714.0"

"Phenolic profile and antioxidant activity of the Algerian ripe date palm fruit (Phoenix dactylifera)","","Date fruit (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> L.) is a highly nutritious and therapeutic food with substantial potential to improve human health. This review emphasizes the nutritional and therapeutic traits of date fruit, focusing on its role as a functional food and dietary supplement. Rich in essential nutrients, antioxidants, and bioactive moieties, date fruit has been shown to provide numerous health benefits. These include managing metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, liver toxicity, kidney toxicity, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Studies exhibit that regular date consumption can contribute to the prevention of chronic illnesses and promote overall health and well-being. However, while research on individual bioactive compounds has been extensive, the full biological effects of the fruit, particularly in synergistic contexts, are not yet fully understood. This review consolidates and critically evaluates recent in vitro, in vivo, and clinical findings on date fruit's bioactive substances, particularly flavonoids, phenolic acids, and dietary fiber, and their role in modulating metabolic disease. Unlike previous studies, this review highlights the specific models and effective dosages: for example, animal studies using 300-1000 mg/kg/day of date extracts showed improvements in lipid profiles and antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, CAT, GST), while in vitro assays at 60-600 μg/mL demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanisms via NF-κB inhibition and cytokine downregulation (IL-6, COX-2, TNF-α). Furthermore, HPLC-ESI-MS profiling showed cultivar-specific differences in polyphenol content and antioxidant potential. The paper also explores lesser-studied effects such as neuroprotection, immunomodulation, and antitumor activity. By integrating dosage-specific mechanistic insights and model-based outcomes, this review offers a more targeted framework for developing functional foods and nutraceuticals from date fruit and highlights the urgent need for further clinical trials to validate these findings and optimize therapeutic applications.","718.0"

In addition, the enterohepatic recirculation of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) was assessed in a linked-rat model. Multiple plasma and urine samples were collected and concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were determined using an electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method. After i.v. administration, plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) declined with a rapid elimination half-life (T(1/2), 0.13 h), followed by sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after drug administration. These plasma concentrations resulted in a significant prolongation of the terminal elimination half-life of RES(AGL) (T(1/2TER), 1.31 h). RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) also displayed sudden increases in plasma concentrations 4 to 8 h after oral administration, with T(1/2TER) of 1.48 and 1.58 h, respectively. RES(AGL) bioavailability was 38% and its exposure was approximately 46-fold lower than that of RES(GLU) (AUC(inf), 7.1 versus 324.7 micromol.h/l). Enterohepatic recirculation was confirmed in the linked-rat model since significant plasma concentrations of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) were observed in bile-recipient rats at 4 to 8 h. The percentages of the exposures of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) that were due to enterohepatic recirculation were 24.7 and 24.0%, respectively. The fraction of drug excreted in the urine over a period of 12 h was negligible. These results confirm that RES(AGL) is bioavailable and undergoes extensive first-pass glucuronidation, and that enterohepatic recirculation contributes significantly to the exposure of RES(AGL) and RES(GLU) in rats.","720.0"

The individual phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C (ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid), and individual carotenoids were characterized and quantified. Five hydroxycinnamic derivatives and 23 flavonoids were characterized and quantified from the pericarp of sweet pepper by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Identification was carried out by their UV spectra, chromatographic comparisons with authentic markers, identification of hydrolysis products, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Hydroxycinnamic derivatives, O-glycosides of quercetin, luteolin, and chrysoeriol, and a large number of C-glycosyl flavones have been characterized. Some of these compounds were found for the first time in nature. Clear differences in the individual and total phenolic content were detected between the different maturity stages. Immature green pepper had a very high phenolic content while green, immature red, and red ripe peppers showed a 4-5-fold reduction. Ascorbic acid was the main form of vitamin C, and its content increased as the pepper reached maturity. The red ripe stage had a relevant impact on the carotenoids content. Thus, immature green peppers showed the highest content of polyphenols, while red ripe fruits had the highest content of vitamin C and provitamin A.","722.0"
"Absorption, metabolism, and excretion of cider dihydrochalcones in healthy humans and subjects with an ileostomy","19199586.0","The phloretin-O-glycosides, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside and phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside, are thought to be unique to apples and apple products. To investigate the metabolism and bioavailability of these compounds, nine healthy and five ileostomy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Thatchers Redstreak apple cider containing 46 micromol of phloretin-O-glycosides. Over the ensuing 24 h period, plasma, urine, and ileal fluid were collected prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The sole metabolite present in quantifiable amounts in plasma was phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, which reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 73 nmol/L and 0.6 h after ingestion (T(max)) with the healthy subjects, and statistically similar values were obtained with the ileostomy volunteers. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide was also detected in urine along with two additional phloretin-O-glucuronides and a phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate. The quantity of phloretin metabolites excreted in urine represented 5.0 + or - 0.9% of intake in healthy volunteers and 5.5 + or - 0.6% in ileostomy volunteers. The similarity in the excretion levels of the two groups and the rapid plasma T(max) indicate absorption of the dihydrochalcones in the small intestine. Of the two major phloretin-O-glycosides in cider, only phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside was recovered in ileal fluid in quantities corresponding to 22% of intake. The absence of phloretin-2'-O-glucoside in ileal fluid suggests that it is more readily absorbed than phloretin-2'-O-(2''-O-xylosyl)glucoside. Phloretin-2'-O-glucuronide, two other phloretin-O-glucuronides, one phloretin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfate, two phloretin-O-sulfates, and the aglycone phloretin were also detected in the ileal fluid. This implies that the wall of the small intestine contains beta-glycosidase, sulfuryltransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activities and that, as well as being absorbed, sizable amounts of the phloretin metabolites that are formed efflux back into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract. The overall recovery of the dihydrochalcones and their metabolites in the ileal fluid was equivalent to 38.6% of intake.","723.0"
"Characterization of flavonoids in different cultivars of onion (Allium cepa L.)","","Twelve cultivars of different colored onions (white, golden, and red) were evaluated for fresh bulb yields and for flavonoid contents. The fresh bulb yields ranged from 3.1 to 6.7 kg m(-2) as found in golden cultivars ""Santana"" and ""Castillo"" respectively. The flavonoids, extracted with methanol/water/acetic acid (50:42:8, v:v:v) from fresh bulbs and characterized by HPLC with a DAD detector, were mainly made up of quercetin and isorhamnetin in the form of aglycones and glycosides. The highest amount of free quercetin was detected in the fresh bulbs of ""Tropea rossa tonda"" (557.8 mg kg(-1)) whereas that of total flavonoids was found in ""Dorata Density"" (979.1 mg kg(-1)). The golden cultivar ""Castillo"" resulted in the highest bulb and flavonoid yields (6.7 kg m(-2) and 5.2 g m(-2) respectively)","724.0"
"Effect of irrigation and lactic acid bacteria inoculants on the phenolic fraction, fermentation and sensory characteristics of olive (Olea europaea L. cv. Ascolana tenera) fruits","","Plant productivity, phenolic profile and natural fermentation, with and without lactic acid bacteria inoculants, were investigated in olive fruit of Ascolana tenera growing under different irrigation regimes. A rainfed control and two treatments receiving a water depth equivalent to 33 and 66% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) from the pit hardening stage and a treatment with 66% of ETc during the entire season (25 May-4 October), were tested. Olive vigour increased with irrigation, which also induced a fresh yield enhancement, mainly due to the increase in fruit size. The differences between treatments were less evident for fruit number per tree and pulp/stone ratio. The phenolic content increased in water deficit-stressed olives and differences were detected in the concentrations of individual phenolic compounds. Olive oil content and fatty acids composition appeared scarcely affected by irrigation. Values of pH, acidity, sugars, phenolic composition and microbial population were monitored during olive fermentation. Extracts of freshly harvested olive fruits exhibited significantly higher phenolic content than extracts of processed olives. The interaction of irrigation and fermentation appeared to have a significant effect on the chemical and sensory characteristics of the end product. The bitter taste of olive fruit was positively correlated with the level of total phenolics, but negatively correlated with the overall acceptability for direct consumption. The fermentation process was accelerated in the presence of lactic acid bacteria inoculants, indicating the potential use of these microorganisms as quality control markers in table olives during processing.","725.0"
"Changes in physicochemical properties of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) during long-term storage","","Five different bean varieties (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) from Kenya, which were obtained either freshly collected or after having been stored for 5 years in tropical conditions (30-40 degrees C, > 75% RH), were compared for their cooking characteristics. Beans under storage were susceptible to the hard-to-cook (HTC) defect, and the bean cooking time was up to 12 times that of the fresh beans, limiting their acceptability. A study was undertaken to investigate changes in nutritionally relevant physicochemical properties of beans during storage. Chemical analysis showed that storage resulted in a decrease in pH and an increase in titratable acidity in all varieties. Total polyphenol, non-tannin polyphenol, tannin, and lignin contents were determined; storage-induced HTC beans contained lower levels of total polyphenols (especially, non-tannin polyphenols) than the fresh beans but higher levels of tannins in all cultivars. Significant increases in lignin and lignified protein were also detected and accompanied by increases in cooking time. A reduction in phytic acid was also observed. These results are discussed in relation to the mechanisms which may underlie the development of the HTC defect.","726.0"
"Baby-leaf and multi-leaf of green and red lettuces are suitable raw materials for the fresh-cut industry","","The contamination of water used in post-harvest handling and processing operations of fresh and frozen fruit, vegetables and herbs (ffFVHs) is a global concern. The most relevant microbial hazards associated with this water are: <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> spp., human pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> and enteric viruses, which have been linked to multiple outbreaks associated with ffFVHs in the European Union (EU). Contamination (i.e. the accumulation of microbiological hazards) of the process water during post-harvest handling and processing operations is affected by several factors including: the type and contamination of the FVHs being processed, duration of the operation and transfer of microorganisms from the product to the water and vice versa, etc. For food business operators (FBOp), it is important to maintain the microbiological quality of the process water to assure the safety of ffFVHs. Good manufacturing practices (GMP) and good hygienic practices (GHP) related to a water management plan and the implementation of a water management system are critical to maintain the microbiological quality of the process water. Identified hygienic practices include technical maintenance of infrastructure, training of staff and cooling of post-harvest process water. Intervention strategies (e.g. use of water disinfection treatments and water replenishment) have been suggested to maintain the microbiological quality of process water. Chlorine-based disinfectants and peroxyacetic acid have been reported as common water disinfection treatments. However, given current practices in the EU, evidence of their efficacy under industrial conditions is only available for chlorine-based disinfectants. The use of water disinfection treatments must be undertaken following an appropriate water management strategy including validation, operational monitoring and verification. During operational monitoring, real-time information on process parameters related to the process and product, as well as the water and water disinfection treatment(s) are necessary. More specific guidance for FBOp on the validation, operational monitoring and verification is needed.","727.0"
"Phenolic compounds, lycopene and antioxidant activity in commercial varieties of tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum)","","Nine commercial varieties of tomato (Rambo, Senior, Ramillete, Liso, Pera, Canario, Durina, Daniella and Remate) produced in Spain were analysed for their lycopene content, content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity. The phenolic compounds were characterised as flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin) and hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic, ferulic and p-coumaric acids). Antioxidant activity was measured using the DPPH and ABTS assays. The concentrations of lycopene and the various phenolic compounds as well as the antioxidant activity were significantly influenced by the tomato variety. Quercetin, the most abundant flavonoid, was found in concentrations ranging between 7.19 and 43.59 mg kg(−1) fresh weight, while naringenin levels were lower than 12.55 mg kg(−1). The most abundant hydroxycinnamic acid was chlorogenic acid, with values ranging from 14 to 32 mg kg(−1) fresh weight, followed by caffeic acid, while p-coumaric and ferulic acids showed similar concentrations lower than 5 mg kg(−1). The highest content of lycopene was found in Ramillete, Pera and Durina (>50 mg kg(−1) fresh weight), while the concentration in the other varieties was between 50 and 30 mg kg(−1), with the exception of Liso (less than 20 mg kg(−1)). The antioxidant activity of tomato extracts varied with the tomato variety and the assay method used. Individual compounds found to be significantly related to antioxidant capacity were lycopene and ferulic and caffeic acids, but not quercetin and chlorogenic acid.","728.0"
"Nutritional composition of commonly cultivated potato varieties","","Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for human health, but its widespread deficiency remains a major public health concern worldwide. Biofortification of staple crops, such as sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), offers a sustainable strategy to improve dietary Se intake. This study systematically evaluated the capacity for natural Se accumulation in 12 major local sweet potato varieties in Guangxi, China. In addition, the effects of different Se application methods and dosages, soil application (10 L/hm<sup>2</sup> and 20 L/hm<sup>2</sup>), foliar spraying (1.5 L/hm<sup>2</sup> and 3.0 L/hm<sup>2</sup>), and combined soil and foliar application, were investigated on yield and quality parameters in two representative varieties: Guiziweishu 1 (high Se accumulator) and Fushu 404 (low Se accumulator). Significant genotypic variation in Se accumulation was observed, with Guiziweishu 1 exhibiting the highest tuber Se content (0.0139 mg/kg), while Fushu 404 had the lowest (0.0030 mg/kg). However, none of the varieties met the local standard for Se-rich agricultural products (0.02-0.20 mg/kg), highlighting the need for exogenous Se supplementation. Field trials demonstrated that all Se application treatments significantly increased tuber Se content, with foliar and combined soil+foliar applications showing the greatest effectiveness. In Guiziweishu 1, all Se treatments except T1 achieved the Se-rich standard, whereas in Fushu 404, only T4 and T6 reached this threshold. Yield improvements were also observed, with the combined soil+foliar treatment (T6) resulting in the highest increases in both fresh yield (24.22% for Guiziweishu 1, 13.06% for Fushu 404) and dry tuber yield (36.52% and 25.77%, respectively), relative to the control group. Se application further enhanced starch and anthocyanin content in Guiziweishu 1, whereas the effects were less pronounced in Fushu 404. These findings underscore the importance of varietal selection and optimized agronomic practices for effective Se biofortification in sweet potato, providing a theoretical and practical basis for developing Se-riched sweet potato cultivation and contributing to improved crop quality, yield, and public health in Se-deficient regions.","729.0"
"Phenolic compounds in raw and cooked rice (Oryza sativa L.) and their inhibitory effect on the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme","","Whole rice has been widely studied due to the abundance of bioactive compounds in its pericarp. Some of the beneficial effects of these compounds on human health have been attributed to their antioxidant and other biological activities, such as enzyme inhibition. In this work, we evaluated the contents of total, soluble and insoluble phenolic compounds of 6 red and 10 non-pigmented genotypes of whole rice as well as their inhibitory effect on the activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). The effects of cooking on phenolics and their inhibitory activities were also investigated. Red genotypes showed high content of phenolics, mainly soluble compounds, at an average of 409.7 mg ferulic acid eq./100 g, whereas overall lower average levels (99.4 mg ferulic acid eq./100 g) at an approximate soluble/insoluble compound ratio of 1:1 were observed in non-pigmented rice. Pigmented rice displayed a greater inhibitory effect on ACE than non-pigmented rice. In fact, a significant correlation between the content of soluble phenolics and ACE inhibition was observed (r = 0.8985, p < 0.05). In addition to significantly reducing the levels of total phenolics and ACE inhibition, cooking altered the soluble/insoluble compound ratio, especially among red rice genotypes.","730.0"
"A new LC/MS/MS rapid and sensitive method for the determination of green tea catechins and their metabolites in biological samples","","A new rapid and sensitive method has been developed, using liquid chromatography in tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) to identify green tea catechin metabolites in plasma and urine after oral intake of a green tea extract. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC)-glucuronide, (-)-epicatechin (EC)-glucuronide, and EC-sulfate were identified in plasma, whereas in urine only the conjugated catechins were detected (EGC-glucuronide, EGC-sulfate, EC-glucuronide, and EC-sulfate). Standard calibration curves prepared in plasma were found to be linear in the range of 10.9-1379.3 nmol/L for EGCG, EGC, ECG, and EC. The accuracy and precision of this assay showed a coefficient of variation of <15%. The method allowed the detection and quantification limits (for 20 microL injection) from 1.1 to 2.6 nmol/L and 3.8-8.7 nmol/L, respectively, in plasma and 0.8-1.8 nmol/L and 2.6-6.0 nmol/L, respectively, in urine. This method can be applied for future clinical and epidemiological studies, allowing the identification of the active metabolites that will reach the target tissues.","731.0"
"Absorption and pharmacokinetics of grapefruit flavanones in beagles","17391560.0","The present study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three different grapefruit flavanone forms in dog plasma and demonstrated their absorption after an oral intake of a grapefruit extract; pharmacokinetic parameters of these forms were also determined. Ten healthy beagles were administered 70 mg citrus flavonoids as a grapefruit extract contained in capsules, while two additional dogs were used as controls and given an excipient. The grapefruit flavanone naringin, along with its metabolites naringenin and naringenin glucuronide, was detected in dog plasma. Blood samples were collected between 0 and 24 h after administration of the extract. Naringin reached its maximun plasma concentration at around 80 min, whereas naringenin and naringenin glucuronide reached their maximun plasma concentrations at around 20 and 30 min, respectively. Maximum plasma concentrations of naringin, naringenin and naringenin glucuronide (medians and ranges) were 0.24 (0.05-2.08), 0.021 (0.001-0.3) and 0.09 (0.034-0.12) micromol/l, respectively. The areas under the curves were 23.16 l (14.04-70.62) min x micromol/for nariningin, 1.78 (0.09-4.95) min x micromol/l for naringenin and 22.5 (2.74-99.23) min x micromol/l for naringenin glucuronide.

"Absorption and pharmacokinetics of green tea catechins in beagles","18205995.0","The present study evaluates for the first time in dogs, the kinetics of green tea catechins and their metabolic forms in plasma and urine. Ten beagles were administered 173 mg (12.35 mg/kg body weight) of catechins as a green tea extract, in capsules. Blood samples were collected during 24 h after intake and urine samples were collected during the following periods of time: 0-2, 2-6, 6-8 and 8-24 h. Two catechins with a galloyl moiety and three conjugated metabolites were detected in plasma. Most of the detected forms in plasma reached their maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) at around 1 h. Median Cmax for ( - )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), ( - )-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), ( - )-epigallocatechin glucuronide (EGC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin glucuronide (EC-glucuronide), ( - )-epicatechin sulphate (EC-sulphate) were 0.3 (range 0.1-1.9), 0.1 (range 0-0.4), 0.8 (range 0.2-3.9), 0.2 (range 0.1-1.7) and 1 (range 0.3-3.4) micromol/l, respectively.

In urine, catechins were present as conjugated forms, suggesting bile excretion of EGCG and ECG. Green tea catechins are absorbed following an oral administration and EGC-glucuronide is the metabolic form that remains in the organism for a longer period of time, suggesting that this compound could suffer an enterohepatic cycle.","733.0"
"Metabolism of the olive oil phenols hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosyl acetate by human hepatoma HepG2 cells","16366672.0","To study the potential hepatic metabolism of olive oil phenols, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were incubated for 2 and 18 h with hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, and hydroxytyrosyl acetate, three phenolic constituents of olive oil. After incubation, culture media and cell lysates were hydrolyzed with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase and analyzed by LC-MS. In vitro methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation of pure phenols were also performed. Methylated and glucuronidated forms of hydroxytyrosol were detected at 18 h of incubation, together with methylglucuronidated metabolites. Hydroxytyrosyl acetate was largely converted into free hydroxytyrosol and subsequently metabolized, yet small amounts of glucuronidated hydroxytyrosyl acetate were detected. Tyrosol was poorly metabolized, with <10% of the phenol glucuronidated after 18 h. Minor amounts of free or conjugated phenols were detected in cell lysates. No sulfated metabolites were found. In conclusion, olive oil phenols can be metabolized by the liver as suggested by the results obtained using HepG2 cells as a hepatic model system.","734.0"
"Antioxidant activity of the main phenolic compounds isolated from hot pepper fruit (Capsicum annuum L.)","15740069.0","Four cultivars (Bronowicka Ostra, Cyklon, Tornado, and Tajfun) of pepper fruit Capsicum annuum L. were studied for phenolics contents and antioxidant activity. Two fractions of phenolics, flavonoids (with phenolic acids) and capsaicinoids, were isolated from the pericarp of pepper fruit at two growth stages (green and red) and were studied for their antioxidant capacity. Both fractions from red fruits had higher activities than those from green fruits. A comparison of the capsaicinoid fraction with the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction from red fruit with respect to their antioxidant activity gave similar results. Phenolic compounds were separated and quantified by LC and HPLC. Contents of nine compounds were determined in the flavonoid and phenolic acid fraction: trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside, trans-p-ferulyl alcohol-4-O-[6-(2-methyl-3-hydroxypropionyl] glucopyranoside, luteolin 6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, apigenin 6-C-beta-d-glucopyranoside-8-C-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, lutoeolin 7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-beta-d-glucopyranoside], quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and luteolin 7-O-[2-(beta-d-apiofuranosyl)-4-(beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-6-malonyl]-beta-d-glucopyranoside. The main compounds of this fraction isolated from red pepper were sinapoyl and feruloyl glycosides, and the main compound from green pepper was quercetin-3-O-l-rhamnoside. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were the main components of the capsaicinoid fraction. A high correlation was found between the content of these compounds and the antioxidant activity of both fractions. Their antioxidant activities were elucidated by heat-induced oxidation in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system and the antiradical activity by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) decoloration test. The highest antioxidant activity in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid system was found for trans-p-sinapoyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside, which was lower than the activity of free sinapic acid. Quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside had the highest antiradical activity in the DPPH system, which was comparable to the activity of quercetin. The activities of capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin were similar to that of trans-p-feruloyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside in the DPPH model system.","735.0"

"Evaluation of a numerical method to predict the polyphenols content in monovarietal olive oils","","Three monovarietal virgin olive oils obtained from olives grown under biological agricultural system, in Portugal, with different ripening stages, were studied in what concerns the parameters usually related with oxidation status (total polyphenols, tocopherols, chlorophylls and carotenoids, peroxide values, oxidative stability, specific extinction coefficients K232 and K270 and titratable acidity). A total of 18 samples were analyzed: seven from Cv. Cobrancosa (maturation indices 1-7), five from Cv. Madural (maturation indices 3-7) and six from Cv. Verdeal Transmontana (maturation indices 1-6). Oxidative stability and polyphenols profile presented high correlation coefficients. Given this high correlation, a numerical method was developed and evaluated to predict total polyphenols contents in olive oil. The method is based on the kinetic equation of the oxidation process in the presence of antioxidants and on Rancimat profiles. Total polyphenols contents obtained with this method were similar to those obtained by the Folin-Ciocalteau method.","737.0"
"Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry for simultaneous analysis of chlorogenic acids and their metabolites in human plasma","","A method using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous analysis of nine chlorogenic acids (CGAs), three isomers each of caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs), feruloylquinic acids (FQAs) and dicaffeoylquinic acids (dCQAs), and their two metabolites, caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA), in human plasma. In simultaneous multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) measurements using ESI-MS/MS with a negative ion mode, a deprotonated molecular ion derived from each of the 11 molecules was used as a precursor ion while three diagnostic product ions characteristic for each were selected for the qualitative analysis. To obtain maximal intensities for all diagnostic product ions, the collision energy was optimized for each one. LC separation was achieved under conditions of a reversed-phase Inertsil ODS-2 column combined with a gradient elution system using 50mM acetic acid with 3% acetonitrile aqueous solution and 50 mM acetic acid with 100% acetonitrile. In the quantitative analysis, one of the three diagnostic product ions for each of the 11 molecules was selected. Application of simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS MRM measurements to analyze the 11 standards spiked into blank human plasma indicated that all diagnostic product ions were detected without any interference, and that the sensitivity, linearity and recovery of this method were acceptable. When using this method to analyze those 11 molecules in the plasma after oral ingestion of 250 ml of a drink containing a green coffee bean extract (300 mg CGAs), all 11 molecules were identified and CQAs, FQAs and FA were quantified. CQAs, FQAs and dCQAs in human plasma were detected for the first time. This method should be useful to understand the biological and pharmacological effects of CGAs, such as improvement of human hypertension.","738.0"
"Identification and quantification of the conjugated metabolites derived from orally administered hesperidin in rat plasma","15479036.0","Hesperidin is a biologically effective flavonoid. Several studies have reported that dietary hesperidin was converted to conjugated metabolites, such as hesperetin-glucuronides and sulfoglucuronides, during absorption and metabolism. However, the chemical structures of the conjugated metabolites, especially the sites of glucuronidation and sulfoglucuronidation in plasma, were unconfirmed. Therefore, the concentrations of the metabolites conjugated at various sites in plasma could not be individually quantified. In the present study, we identified the chemical structures and concentrations of the major conjugated metabolites in rat plasma after oral administration of hesperidin. Two hesperetin-glucuronides were prepared and identified as hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Using these authentic compounds, the concentrations of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide in rat plasma were individually determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In rat plasma, hesperetin-glucuronides were primarily comprised of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. The concentration of hesperetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide was slightly higher than that of hesperetin-3'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Furthermore, not only hesperetin conjugates but also homoeriodictyol conjugates were observed in rat plasma.

"Comparative assessment of distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins in rabbit and rat ocular tissues","16635490.0","Anthocyanins (ACs) are phenolic compounds that are distributed widely in fruits and vegetables. Although consumption of these compounds has been shown to improve visual function, the distribution of ACs in ocular tissue has not been examined in detail. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate the ocular distribution of blackcurrant anthocyanins (BCAs) in rats and rabbits after oral, intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Identification and quantification of ACs were carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-visible detection, respectively. BCAs were identified in the plasma and whole eye after oral and i.p. administration in rats. No other peaks were detected in either plasma or ocular tissues after administration when the absorbance of the eluate was monitored at 520 nm. This finding indicates that intact forms of ACs were present in rats after administration of BCA. In rats given i.p. administration, the concentration of total ACs in the whole eye and some ocular tissues was higher than that measured in plasma. These results suggested that ACs detected in the ocular tissues were not due to residual blood. Following i.v. administration in rabbits, four ACs were identified in the plasma and several ocular tissues including the aqueous humor, cornea, sclera, choroid, ciliary body, iris and retina. A small amount of ACs was also detected in the vitreous and lens. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BCAs were absorbed and distributed in ocular tissues as intact forms. Our data show clearly that intact forms of BCAs pass thorough the blood-aqueous barrier and blood-retinal barrier in both rats and rabbits.","740.0"
"Ingested delphinidin-3-rutinoside is primarily excreted to urine as the intact form and to bile as the methylated form in rats","","Many reports have described the bioavailability of anthocyanins; however, most of these reports investigated only the amount of anthocyanins excreted in urine. In the present study, we calculated the pharmacokinetic bioavailability of anthocyanins in rats by measuring the plasma concentration of delphinidin-3-rutinoside that had been administered orally or intravenously. Delphinidin-3-rutinoside was primarily absorbed in the blood and excreted into urine as unmetabolized forms with a T(max) of 26.3 min and a C(max) of 0.285 +/- 0.071 micromol/L. We detected small amounts of the metabolite 4'-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside in the plasma, but we detected neither anthocyanidin (aglycone) nor glucuro- or sulfoconjugates. For the 8 h period after intake, delphinidin-3-rutinoside and 4'-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside were excreted to urine at 795 +/- 375 and 12.3 +/- 2.91 nmol, respectively. Relative to intravenous injection, oral administration of delphinidin-3-rutinoside resulted in complete bioavailability (0.49 +/- 0.06%). Analysis of delphinidin-3-rutinoside plasma concentrations in bile cannulated rats revealed that, for the 8-h period after intake, the intact delphinidin-3-rutinoside excretion ratio in bile was 11% of the excretion ratio of 4'-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside, 1.91 +/- 0.35 nmol versus 17.4 +/- 8.67 nmol, respectively. Setting the bile duct cannulation in a Bollman-type cage, however, significantly increased the bioavailability of orally administered delphinidin-3-rutinoside (18.14 +/- 6.24%). This effect appears to stem immobilization stress by reducing gastrointestinal motility. The cumulative excretion of delphinidin-3-rutinoside and 4'-O-methyl-delphinidin-3-rutinoside in urine and bile was 2.67 +/- 1.24% (w/w) of the dose ingested. Studies report that several metabolites are formed after oral ingestion of anthocyanins. Examples include glucuronyl from cyanidin-3-glucoside and both glucuronyl and sulfate conjugates from pelargonidin-3-glucoside. Our results indicate that delphinidin-3-rutinoside might be metabolized differently from cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-glucoside.","741.0"

Free phenolic acids were extracted with a mixture of methanol and 10% acetic acid. Bound phenolic acids were liberated using first alkaline and then acid hydrolysis followed by extraction with diethyl ether/ethyl acetate (1:1). All fractions were quantified separately by HPLC. After HPLC quantification, results of alkali and acid hydrolysates were calculated to represent total phenolic acids. Ellagic acid was quantified separately after long (20 h) acid hydrolysis. The methods developed were effective for the determination of phenolic acids in plant foods. DAD response was linear for all phenolic acids within the ranges evaluated, with correlation coefficients exceeding 0.999. Coefficients of variation for 4-8 sample replicates were consistently below 10%. Recovery tests of phenolic acids were performed for every hydrolysis condition using several samples.

Avenanthramides were determined in three oat products. Free phenolic acids, alk(en)ylresorcinols, and avenanthramides were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, 100% methanol, and 80% methanol, respectively, and quantified by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were quantified by HPLC analysis after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The highest contents of total phenolic acids were in brans of wheat (4527 mg/kg) and rye (4190 mg/kg) and in whole-grain flours of these grains (1342 and 1366 mg/kg, respectively). In other products, the contents varied from 111 mg/kg (white wheat bread) to 765 mg/kg (whole-grain rye bread). Common phenolic acids found in the grain products were ferulic acid (most abundant), ferulic acid dehydrodimers, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid. The grain products were found to contain either none or only low amounts of free phenolic acids. The content of avenanthramides in oat flakes (26-27 mg/kg) was about double that found in oat bran (13 mg/kg). The highest contents of alk(en)ylresorcinols were observed in brans of rye (4108 mg/kg) and wheat (3225 mg/kg). In addition, whole-grain rye products (rye bread, rye flour, and whole-wheat flour) contained considerable levels of alk(en)ylresorcinols (524, 927, and 759 mg/kg, respectively).","744.0"
"Phenolic acids in berries, fruits, and beverages","16968082.0","The contents of soluble and total phenolic acids were analyzed in samples of 29 berries and berry products, 24 fruits and fruit peels, and 12 beverages. Variation of phenolic acids in berries was also studied. Soluble phenolic acids were extracted with methanolic acetic acid, and a tentative quantification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The total phenolic acid content was determined by HPLC after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. The content of total phenolic acids as aglycones in the above samples varied from 0 (pear cider) to 103 mg/100 g fresh weight (rowanberry).

"Phenolic acids in potatoes , vegetables , and some of their products","","The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and contents of soluble and total phenolic acids in a wide range of vegetables consumed in Finland. The determinations were performed from the pooled samples (14 potato and 45 other vegetable samples). Soluble phenolic acids were extracted with methanolic acetic acid and a tentative quantification was performed by HPLC. The contents of total phenolic acids were determined by HPLC after alkaline and acid hydrolyses. Chlorogenic acid derivatives were the most dominant soluble phenolic acids, while caffeic acid was the most dominant phenolic acid aglycone in the samples studied. Highest contents of soluble phenolic acids were found in raw and cooked potato peels: 23-45 mg/100 g fresh weight calculated as aglycones. In addition, pot-grown lettuces, Chinese cabbage, broccoli, carrot, aubergine, Jerusalem artichoke, peanut and most of the boiled and peeled potato tubers contained more than 5 mg/100 g of soluble phenolic acids calculated as aglycones. Among the best vegetable sources of total phenolic acids were potatoes, with contents varying from 7.9 mg/100 g (cooked and peeled Rosamunda variety) to 52 mg/100 g (cooked peel of Van Gogh variety), and red cabbage, carrot, aubergine, Jerusalem artichoke, broccoli, pot-grown lettuce, spinach, radish and red beet, with contents from 11 mg/100 g (spinach) to 52 mg/100 g (pot-grown lettuce Lollo Rosso).

"Absorption of red clover isoflavones in human subjects: results from a pilot study","20067656.0","In addition to soya-derived preparations, red clover-based dietary supplements have gained considerable interest as an alternative isoflavone (IF) source. While metabolism and bioavailability of the main IF from both sources have already been investigated, studies are still lacking on the biokinetic behaviour of IF, which are present in red clover in minor amounts. In the present pilot study, in which seven volunteers ingested a single dose of a commercial red clover dietary supplement, we focused on the absorption of three such IF, irilone (IRI), prunetin (PRUN) and pseudobaptigenin (PBAP). The compounds were measured as aglycones after enzymatic hydrolysis. A single intake of an amount of as low as 3.8 mg IRI (out of 38.8 mg IF in total) resulted in an IRI plasma concentration of 0.35 (sd 0.16) mum at 6.5 h post-ingestion. Compared to the plasma concentrations found for daidzein (0.39 mum) and genistein (0.06 mum), expected to be the main IF metabolites in plasma, the present findings indicate that IRI might possess a relatively high bioavailability. Furthermore, PRUN and PBAP were detected in human plasma for the first time.","747.0"
"Liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometric characterization of flavonol glycosides in tomato extracts and human plasma","10353226.0","Flavonoids continue to attract wide attention as possible very useful agents for combating free radical pathologies, i.e. the pathological states associated with free radical overproduction. Commonly used methods for the analysis of plant flavonoids include high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). On the other hand, the soft-ionization approach based on electrospray ionization (ESI-MS) permits highly selective analysis of complex matrices. In this work, we examined firstly the ESI-MS behaviour of representative aglycones and glycosides of flavonols, flavones and isoflavones with the aim of suggesting a possible relationship between structure and mass spectra. Using HPLC coupled to a diode array detector (DAD) for on-line UV spectra acquisition, and in parallel to ESI-MS for mass spectra (LC/DAD-ESI-MS), we have developed methodology to observe flavonols directly in tomato puree extract. In this way, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides in tomato extracts and to characterize a flavonol trisaccharide. For the first time, using LC/ESI-MS, it has been possible to detect intact flavonol glycosides in plasma of healthy volunteers and to provide further evidence on the absorption of flavonoid glycosides after consumption of common vegetables like tomatoes.","748.0"
"Isotope Dilution Gas Chromatographic-Mass Spectrometric Method for the Determination of Isoflavonoids, Coumestrol, and Lignans in Food Samples","8789715.0","We present a method for the quantitative determination of the phytoestrogens formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein, genistein, and coumestrol and simultaneously the lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and matairesinol in plant-derived foods. These compounds are measured by isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode (ID/GC/MS/SIM) using synthesized deuterated internal standards for the correction of losses during the procedure. A three-step hydrolysis--a rehydration with distilled H2O, followed by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis--has been applied in order to convert the diphenolic glycosides into their respective aglycones. Purification and separation are carried out in two ion-exchange chromatographic steps followed by derivatization and GC-MS. The within-assay imprecision values vary 3.1-9.6% and the between-assay imprecision 7.0-21.2%. The mean recovery of authentic standards processed through the whole procedure varied from 95.5 to 105.5%. Values for some different food samples are presented.

"Lignan and isoflavonoid concentrations in tea and coffee","9505801.0","Tea is a beverage consumed widely throughout the world. The existence in tea of chemopreventing compounds possessing antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and antioxidative properties has been reported. High intakes of tea and foods containing flavonoids have recently been shown to be negatively correlated to the occurrence of CHD. However, tea may contain other compounds with similar activities. Using a new gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric method we measured lignans and isoflavonoids in samples of twenty commercial teas (black, green and red varieties) and, for comparison, six coffees. Both unbrewed and brewed tea were investigated. The analysis of the teas yielded relatively high levels of the lignans secoisolariciresinol (5.6-28.9 mg/kg; 15.9-81.9 mumol/kg) and matairesinol (0.56-4.13 mg/kg; 1.6-11.5 mumol/kg) but only low levels of isoflavonoids. Because the plant lignans, as well as their mammalian metabolites enterolactone and enterodiol, have antioxidative properties and these mammalian lignans occur in high concentrations in plasma, we hypothesize that lignan polyphenols may contribute to the protective effect of tea on CHD.","750.0"
"Effect of two cooking procedures on phytochemical compounds, total antioxidant capacity and colour of selected frozen vegetables","","The effect of boiling and steaming on content of phytochemicals (carotenoids, chlorophylls, polyphenols and ascorbic acid) all evaluated by HPLC, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) measured by means of TEAC and FRAP assays and colour (L∗, a∗, b∗, C, H°) of three frozen vegetables (carrot, cauliflower and spinach) was evaluated. Steaming increased the content of polyphenols in all vegetables and limited the depletion of carotenoids in spinach. Accordingly, TAC remained unvaried or increased both for steamed carrot and spinach. Boiling had a more marked effect on nutritional pattern of frozen vegetables in comparison with steaming, leading to a general loss of phytochemical compounds and TAC for all vegetables. Ascorbic acid was detected only in cauliflower and decreased after both treatments. Colour of frozen vegetables was only slightly influenced by cooking, probably due to blanching pre-treatment. Slight decrements of redness (a∗) for carrot in relation with loss of carotenoids and greenness (−a∗) for steamed spinach, due to a significant loss of total chlorophylls, were observed. Steaming increased TAC and bioaccessibility of polyphenols in all frozen vegetables while boiling led to a general loss of carotenoids and phenolic compounds and a TAC decrease.","751.0"
"Survey of the Free and Conjugated Myricetin and Quercetin Content of Red Wines of Different Geographical Origins","10554248.0","Gradient reversed-phase HPLC was used to obtain quantitative estimates of the levels of free and conjugated myricetin and quercetin in 65 red wines from Italy, Chile, France, California, Australia, Bulgaria, Spain, Romania, New Zealand, Brazil, Morocco, and Hungary. The concentrations of total flavonols ranged from 4.6 to 41.6 mg L(-1). High total flavonol levels appear to be associated with the use of thick-skinned grape varieties, such as Cabernet Sauvignon, with a high skin:volume ratio, which were left to ripen fully in sunny conditions before harvest and which were extracted efficiently by modern methods of vinification. Some Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon wines contained up to 40 mg of total flavonols L(-1), which was higher than the levels detected in Cabernet Sauvignon from France, California, and Australia. The flavonol content of 1989 and 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon from Bulgaria was <6 mg L(-1). Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Pinot Noir all contained consistently higher concentrations of flavonols than their counterparts from different geographical regions.","752.0"
"Phenolic content and antioxidant activity of olive extracts","","Olive leaves are a valuable source of natural bioactive compounds, particularly poly-phenols and flavonoids, recognized for their potent antioxidant and health-promoting properties. The extraction of these high-value products has gained increasing attention due to their relevance in food sustainability and the circular economy. However, the concentration and profile of these compounds vary substantially depending on the ol-ive variety and the extraction method applied. This study evaluated the influence of extraction method and olive variety on the phenolic composition and antioxidant po-tential of olive leaf extracts from nine cultivars cultivated in Morocco. Two conven-tional extraction techniques, maceration and Soxhlet extraction, were compared for their efficiency in recovering extraction yield, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and total condensed tannins, along with antioxidant activity measured by DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays. Analyses of variance indicated that varie-tal differences were the predominant source of variation in phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity, whereas the extraction method mainly influenced yield. Soxhlet extraction enhanced phenolic recovery and antioxidant potential, while maceration favored flavonoid extraction. These findings highlight the potential of olive leaf ex-tracts derived from Manzanilla, Haouzia, Picual, and Moroccan Picholine varieties using Soxhlet as sustainable natural antioxidants for functional, cosmetic, and phar-maceutical uses.","753.0"
"Effect of different cooking regimes on rhubarb polyphenols","","Polyphenolic components, such as anthraquinones and stilbenes, from species of the genus Rheum have been shown to have a range of bioactivities relevant to human health. This paper outlines the polyphenolic composition of edible petioles of garden rhubarb (Rheum rhapontigen) and describes the effects of common cooking methods on total polyphenolic content, anthocyanin content and total antioxidant capacity. Most cooking regimes (fast stewing, slow stewing and baking) except blanching increased total polyphenol content and overall antioxidant capacity, compared to the raw material. The patterns of anthocyanin content and total polyphenol content between the different cooking regimes suggested a balance between two processes; cooking facilitated the release of polyphenol compounds from the rhubarb but also caused breakdown of the released compounds. Baking and slow stewing offered the best maintenance of colour through preservation of anthocyanin and the highest antioxidant capacity. Baking for 20min provided well-cooked rhubarb with the highest antioxidant capacity and the highest anthocyanin content, which is important for the aesthetic quality of the dish. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) analysis putatively identified over 40 polyphenol components in raw rhubarb, including anthraquinone, stilbene, anthocyanin and flavonol derivatives. Baking caused selective effects on the stability of the different polyphenol components. Initially, the yield of all components increased but there was a drastic decline in the relative stability of anthraquinone aglycones with increasing cooking time and initial evidence for the turnover of other anthraquinone derivatives was obtained.","754.0"
"Anthocyanin glycosides from berry fruit are absorbed and excreted unmetabolized by both humans and rats","14705874.0","Anthocyanins, the red/blue pigments found in plants, are polyphenolic compounds consumed by humans and are part of a normal diet. Recent studies have shown that anthocyanins have substantial bioactivity including antioxidant activity and therefore may have beneficial effects on human health. Anthocyanins are a group of over 500 compounds of diverse structures containing different core phenolic aglycons and conjugated with sugars in a variety of glycosylation patterns. In this study, we have investigated the bioabsorption of 15 anthocyanins with structures containing different aglycons and conjugated sugars extracted from blueberry, boysenberry, black raspberry, and blackcurrant in both humans and rats. Intact and unmetabolized anthocyanins were detected in urine of rats and humans following dosing for all molecular structures investigated, thus demonstrating that anthocyanins with diverse molecular structure and from different dietary sources are bioavailable at diet relevant dosage rates. In addition, the relative concentrations of anthocyanins detected in urine following dosing varied, indicating that differences in bioavailability are due to variations in chemical structure. Our results suggest that the nature of the sugar conjugate and the phenolic aglycon are both important determinants of anthocyanin absorption and excretion in rats and humans.","755.0"

Concentrated extracts of barley were injected onto a high-performance gel filtration column (Superdex 75 HR), and were eluted with methanol. This procedure resolved the dimeric proanthocyanidins (prodelphinidin B3 and procyanidin B3), as well as the trimeric procyanidin C2 and three other trimeric prodelphinidins. The separated flavanoid peaks were collected and their contents were estimated by UV spectrophotometry, reaction with p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde, and reversed phase HPLC with electrochemical detection. This method produced proanthocyanidins in sufficient amounts to calibrate a system for direct injection chromatographic analysis of beers and barley extracts. The method described may be optimized for the isolation of dimeric proanthocyanidins only, in which case the preparation can take as little as 3 h; alternatively, by extending the chromatographic separation to 9 h, the four major trimeric proanthocyanidins of barley can be recovered also in a chromatographically pure state.","759.0"
"The role of flavanoid polyphenols in beer stability","","Treatment of different beers with polyvinylpolypyrollidone (PVPP) at 100 g/hl was shown to remove polyphenols and simultaneously to diminish the endogenous reducing capacities by 9-38%. Polyphenols contributed up to 60% of the endogenous reducing capacities of the untreated beers. Additions (100-200 mg/L) of various simple flavanols to PVPP-treated beer were shown to restore reducing capacity, but simple flavanols accounted for only about 25% of the reducing capacity of untreated beer. Experiments were conducted to determine whether the colloidal stabilization of lager beers by treatment with PVPP also affected flavor stability. When lager beer was treated on a pilot scale with varying dosages of PVPP, the resulting improvements in colloidal stability were not accompanied by obvious changes in flavor stability during forced aging. Different amounts of prodelphinidin B3, procyanidin B3, and (+)-catechin were added to samples of a PVPP-stabilized lager beer that were then force-aged. The simple flavanols were rapidly oxidized during aging and became potent initiators of chill haze but accounted for only about 20% of the haze formed in unstabilized beer. No significant effects, either of PVPP treatment or of flavanol additions on the development of staling indicators were detected.","760.0"

"Comparison of the polyphenol profiles of apple fruit cultivars by correspondance analysis","","Fleshy fruits of angiosperms are organs specialized for promoting seed dispersal by attracting herbivores and enticing them to consume the organ and the seeds it contains. Ripening can be broadly defined as the processes serving as a plant strategy to make the fleshy fruit appealing to animals, consisting of a coordinated series of changes in color, texture, aroma, and flavor that result from an intricate interplay of genetically and epigenetically programmed events. The ripening of fruits can be categorized into two types: climacteric, which is characterized by a rapid increase in respiration rate typically accompanied by a burst of ethylene production, and non-climacteric, in which this pronounced peak in respiration is absent. Here we review current knowledge of transcriptomic changes taking place in apple (Malus × domestica, climacteric) and grapevine (Vitis vinifera, non-climacteric) fruit during ripening, with the aim of highlighting specific and common hormonal and molecular events governing the process in the two species. With this perspective, we found that specific NAC transcription factor members participate in ripening initiation in grape and are involved in restoring normal physiological ripening progression in impaired fruit ripening in apple. These elements suggest the existence of a common regulatory mechanism operated by NAC transcription factors and auxin in the two species.","762.0"
"Comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity","16819902.0","The antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. In vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (Clostridium perfringens and Escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia sp., and Shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. The dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. These findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by HPLC, against L. monocytogenes. In particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that not all oils classified as ""olive oil"" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.","763.0"
"Resveratrol - occurrence in wine originating from Czech vineyard regions and effect on human health","","The aim of this paper was to analyze selected physicochemical properties and the pro-health potential of wines produced in southeastern Poland, in the Subcarpathian region, and commercial Carlo Rossi wines enhanced with cowslip (<i>Primula veris</i> L.). This study used ultra-performance reverse-phase liquid chromatography (UPLC)-PDA-MS/MS to perform most of the analysis, including the polyphenolic compounds and saponin content in wines enriched by <i>Primula veris</i> L. The initial anthocyanin content in Subcarpathian (Regional) red wine samples increased four times to the level of 1956.85 mg/L after a 10% addition of <i>Primula veris</i> L. flowers. For white wines, a five-fold increase in flavonol content was found in Subcarpathian (Regional) and wine samples, and an almost 25-fold increase in flavonol content was found in Carlo Rossi (Commercial) wine samples at the lowest (2.5%) <i>Primula veris</i> L. flower addition. Qualitative analysis of the regional white wines with a 10% <i>Primula veris</i> L. flower enhancement demonstrated the highest kaempferol content (197.75 mg/L) and a high quercetin content (31.35 mg/L). Thanks to wine enrichment in triterpenoid saponins and in polyphenolic compounds from <i>Primula veris</i> L. flowers, which are effectively extracted to wine under mild conditions, both white and red wines can constitute a highly pro-health component of diets, which is valuable in preventing chronic heart failure.","764.0"
"Formation and identification of 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin in humans","11353745.0","The possible beneficial effects of tea consumption have attracted a great deal of attention. Many of the biological effects have been attributed to tea catechins, but the metabolic fate of these compounds is not clear. In the present study, a major metabolite observed in human blood and urine samples after green tea administration was identified as a O-methylated derivative of (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) by comparison with products from chemical and enzymatic O-methylation of EGC. The structure of this metabolite was elucidated as 4'-O-methyl-(-)-epigallocatechin (4'-O-MeEGC) by (1)H and (13)C NMR and heteronuclear multiple bond connectivity experiment. The human plasma level of 4'-O-MeEGC reached its peak value within the first 2 h following tea ingestion. Its maximum concentration was 4 to 6 times higher than that of EGC. The half-lives of EGC and 4'-O-MeEGC in the blood were 1.02 +/- 0.07 and 4.39 +/- 1.14 h, respectively. The amount of 4'-O-MeEGC excreted in urine was about 3 times higher than that of EGC, and 88% of 4'-O-MeEGC was excreted in urine within 8 h.

The half-lives of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG were 4.1 +/- 0.8 and 2.7 +/- 0.9 h, respectively. The cumulative urinary excretion of 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG during a 24 h period was 140.3 +/- 48.6 microg, about 5-fold higher than that of EGCG, but the excreted 4',4' '-DiMeEGCG and EGCG in urine only accounted for about 0.1% of ingested EGCG. (-)-5-(3',4',5'-Trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4) and (-)-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6), along with another possible ring-fission metabolite, (-)-5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were detected in human urine after green tea ingestion. The cumulative excretion of M4, M6', and M6 during a 24 h period ranged from 75 microg to 1.2 mg, 0.6 to 6 mg, and 0.6 to 10 mg, respectively. The combined excretion of all three ring-fission metabolites accounted for 1.5-16% of ingested catechins. M4, M6', and M6 were all observed after the ingestion of pure EGCG or EGC by human subjects, whereas only M6 was produced after EC ingestion. These metabolites as well as monomethylated EGCG were detected in mice and rats after tea or EGCG administration, and the tissue levels reflected the rather low bioavailability of EGCG in rats. The presently characterized methylated EGCG metabolites and ring-fission products exist in substantial quantities and may contribute to the biological activities of tea.","766.0"
"Urinary and plasma levels of resveratrol and quercetin in humans, mice, and rats after ingestion of pure compounds and grape juice","14969553.0","The present study investigates the bioavailability of resveratrol and quercetin in humans, mice, and rats after oral ingestion of grape juice preparations or pure aglycones. Oral administration of resveratrol and quercetin to humans yielded detectable levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their derivatives in the plasma and urine. Urinary levels of resveratrol, quercetin, and their metabolites were observed in human subjects receiving 600 and 1200 mL of grape juice, whereas quercetin metabolites were identified in urine samples even after receiving 200 mL of grape juice. The cumulative amounts of resveratrol and quercetin excreted in the urine of mice receiving concentrated grape juice for 4 days were 2.3 and 0.7% of the ingested doses, respectively. After i.g. administration of resveratrol to rats (2 mg/kg), up to 1.2 microM resveratrol was observed in the plasma. The study demonstrates that the glycoside forms of resveratrol and quercetin in grape juice are absorbed to a lesser extent than the aglycones.","767.0"
"Effects of genotype, location and baking on the phenolic content and some antioxidant properties of cereal species","","In order to assess the effect of genotype, location and their interaction on total phenolic content (TPC) of chemical extracts, the whole grains of durum and soft wheat, oat, barley and triticale were evaluated. Data showed differences in phenolic content of chemical extracts among cereal species and the analysis of variance confirmed the key role of location. Besides TPC and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values assessed by chemical extraction were compared with those obtained with an in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction. Differences were found between methanolic and enzymatic extracts, and data confirmed that enzymatic technique enhanced extraction of antioxidants but pointed out lesser differences among cereal types. The breads obtained by flours enriched with different levels of bran were also evaluated. Chemical extracts highlighted the increasing levels of antioxidants according to bran enrichments, without pointing out changes caused by baking. The enzymatic extraction instead did not show differences regarding to bran enrichments, but documented a loss in antioxidant properties of breads in respect to corresponding flours. On the other hand the scarce differences between flours and corresponding breads did not allow asserting that baking modified the TPC and TEAC, independently of the extraction methods used. Indeed, during baking process, also the observed phenolic acids profile variations did not vary the antioxidant properties of breads.","768.0"
"Urinary flavonoids and phenolic acids as biomarkers of intake for polyphenol-rich foods","16870009.0","Estimation of dietary intake of polyphenols is difficult, due to limited availability of food composition data and bias inherent to dietary assessment methods. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between the intake of polyphenol-rich foods and the urinary excretion of several phenolic compounds and therefore explore whether these phenolic compounds could be used as a biomarker of intake. Fifty-three participants of the SU.VI.MAX study (a randomised primary-prevention trial evaluating the effect of daily antioxidant supplementation on chronic diseases) collected a 24 h urine and a spot urine sample and filled a dietary record during a 2 d period. Thirteen polyphenols and metabolites, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, m-coumaric acid, gallic acid, 4-O-methylgallic acid, quercetin, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin, phloretin, enterolactone and enterodiol, were measured using HPLC-electrospray ionisation-MS-MS. In spot samples apple consumption was positively correlated to phloretin, grapefruit consumption to naringenin, orange to hesperetin, citrus fruit consumption to both naringenin and hesperetin, with r coefficients ranging from 0.31 to 0.57 (P < 0.05). The combination of fruits and/or fruit juices was positively correlated to gallic acid and 4-O-methylgallic acid, isorhamnetin, kaempferol, hesperetin, naringenin and phloretin (r 0.24-0.44, P < 0.05). Coffee consumption was positively correlated to caffeic and chlorogenic acids (r 0.29 and 0.63, P < 0.05 respectively). Black tea and wine consumption were positively correlated with gallic and 4-O-methylgallic acids (r 0.37-0.54, P < 0.001). The present results suggest that several polyphenols measured in a spot urine sample can be used as biomarkers of polyphenol-rich food intake.","769.0"

"Absorption, metabolism, and antioxidant effects of pomegranate (Punica granatum l.) polyphenols after ingestion of a standardized extract in healthy human volunteers","17090147.0","The intake of polyphenols has been demonstrated to have health-promoting and disease-preventive effects. The pomegranate (Punica granatum L.), which is rich in several polyphenols, has been used for centuries in ancient cultures for its medicinal purposes. The potential health benefits of pomegranate polyphenols have been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies and in vivo experiments. This study investigated the absorption and antioxidant effects of a standardized extract from pomegranate in healthy human volunteers after the acute consumption of 800 mg of extract. Results indicate that ellagic acid (EA) from the extract is bioavailable, with an observed C(max) of 33 ng/mL at t(max) of 1 h. The plasma metabolites urolithin A, urolithin B, hydroxyl-urolithin A, urolithin A-glucuronide, and dimethyl ellagic acid-glucuronide were identified by HPLC-MS. The antioxidant capacity measured with the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay was increased with a maximum effect of 32% after 0.5 h, whereas the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was not affected. The inflammation marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not significantly affected after 4 h after the consumption of the extract. Overall, this study demonstrated the absorbability of EA from a pomegranate extract high in ellagitannin content and its ex vivo antioxidant effects.","771.0"
"Flavonoid (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin) content of edible tropical plants","11410016.0","Studies were conducted on the flavonoids (myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin) contents of 62 edible tropical plants. The highest total flavonoids content was in onion leaves (1497.5 mg/kg quercetin, 391.0 mg/kg luteolin, and 832.0 mg/kg kaempferol), followed by Semambu leaves (2041.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1663.0 mg/kg), black tea (1491.0 mg/kg), papaya shoots (1264.0 mg/kg), and guava (1128.5 mg/kg). The major flavonoid in these plant extracts is quercetin, followed by myricetin and kaempferol. Luteolin could be detected only in broccoli (74.5 mg/kg dry weight), green chili (33.0 mg/kg), bird chili (1035.0 mg/kg), onion leaves (391.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (202.0 mg/kg), belimbi leaves (464.5 mg/kg), French bean (11.0 mg/kg), carrot (37.5 mg/kg), white radish (9.0 mg/kg), local celery (80.5 mg/kg), limau purut leaves (30.5 mg/kg), and dried asam gelugur (107.5 mg/kg). Apigenin was found only in Chinese cabbage (187.0 mg/kg), bell pepper (272.0 mg/kg), garlic (217.0 mg/kg), belimbi fruit (458.0 mg/kg), French peas (176.0 mg/kg), snake gourd (42.4 mg/kg), guava (579.0 mg/kg), wolfberry leaves (547.0 mg/kg), local celery (338.5 mg/kg), daun turi (39.5 mg/kg), and kadok (34.5 mg/kg). In vegetables, quercetin glycosides predominate, but glycosides of kaempferol, luteolin, and apigenin are also present.

"Effects of different cooking methods on nutritional and physicochemical characteristics of selected vegetables","18069785.0","The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of three common cooking practices (i.e., boiling, steaming, and frying) on phytochemical contents (i.e., polyphenols, carotenoids, glucosinolates, and ascorbic acid), total antioxidant capacities (TAC), as measured by three different analytical assays [Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] and physicochemical parameters of three vegetables (carrots, courgettes, and broccoli). Water-cooking treatments better preserved the antioxidant compounds, particularly carotenoids, in all vegetables analyzed and ascorbic acid in carrots and courgettes. Steamed vegetables maintained a better texture quality than boiled ones, whereas boiled vegetables showed limited discoloration. Fried vegetables showed the lowest degree of softening, even though antioxidant compounds were less retained. An overall increase of TEAC, FRAP, and TRAP values was observed in all cooked vegetables, probably because of matrix softening and increased extractability of compounds, which could be partially converted into more antioxidant chemical species. Our findings defy the notion that processed vegetables offer lower nutritional quality and also suggest that for each vegetable a cooking method would be preferred to preserve the nutritional and physicochemical qualities.","773.0"
"Flavonol content varies among black currant cultivars","11453762.0","Flavonoids and related plant compounds in fruits and vegetables are of particular importance as they have been found to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity. The HPLC-based quantitative procedure, with improved extraction and hydrolysis, was used to analyze the content of the flavonols quercetin, myricetin, and kaempferol in 10 black currant cultivars from organic farms and in 5 cultivars from conventional farms. Myricetin was the most abundant flavonol, and its amount varied significantly among cultivars, from 8.9 to 24.5 mg x 100 g(-1) (fresh weight). The quercetin levels in black currant also varied widely among the cultivars, from 5.2 to 12.2 mg x 100 g(-1). The kaempferol levels in black currant cultivars were low, ranging from 0.9 to 2.3 mg x 100 g(-1). The sum of these major flavonols varied widely among black currant cultivars. No consistent differences in the contents of flavonols were found between the same black currant cultivars grown in organic and conventional ways. The high variability in the levels of flavonols in different cultivars offers possible avenues for identifying and selecting cultivars rich in certain flavonols for the special production of berries for industrial use.","774.0"
"Bioavailablility of elderberry anthocyanins","12044949.0","Considerable epidemiological evidence suggests a link between the consumption of diets rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers. Anthocyanins have received attention as important dietary constituents that may provide health benefits and contribute antioxidant capacity beyond that provided by essential micronutrients such as ascorbate, tocopherols, and selenium. The emergence of renewed interest by industrial countries in traditional herbal medicines and the development of 'functional foods' are stimulating the need for more information regarding the bioavailability and efficacy of plant polyphenols. Flavonoids represent a numerous group of secondary plant metabolites based on the structure of a pyran ring flanked by two or more phenyl rings and varying subtly in the degree of unsaturation and the pattern of hydroxylation or methylation. Flavonoids also vary in the type of sugar attached or the degree of polymerization. Anthocyanins, potent flavonoid antioxidants widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and red wines, normally occur in nature as glycosides, a form not usually considered as bioavailable. We have examined the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins in humans. Anthocyanins were detected as glycosides in both plasma and urine samples. The elimination of plasma anthocyanins appeared to follow first-order kinetics and most anthocyanin compounds were excreted in urine within 4 h after feeding. The current findings appear to refute assumptions that anthocyanins are not absorbed in their unchanged glycosylated forms in humans.","775.0"
"Determination of flavonoids and phenolics and their distribution in almonds","16819912.0","Limited information is available concerning the qualitative and quantitative composition of polyphenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, in almonds. We determined total phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids in California almond (Prunus dulcis) skins and kernels among the principal almond varieties (Butte, Carmel, Fritz, Mission, Monterey, Nonpareil, Padre, and Price) with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/electrochemical detection and UV detection. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry under identical HPLC conditions was utilized to verify identities of the predominant flavonoids and phenolic acids. Total phenols ranged from 127 (Fritz) to 241 (Padre) mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g of fresh weight. The analyses were compiled to produce a data set of 18 flavonoids and three phenolic acids. The predominant flavonoids were isorhamnetin-3-O-rutinoside and isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (in combination), catechin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, and isorhamnetin-3-O-galactoside at 16.81, 1.93, 1.17, 0.85, 0.83, and 0.50 mg/100 g of fresh weight almonds, respectively. Using the existing approach of calculating only the aglycone form of flavonoids for use in the U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrient database, whole almonds would provide the most prevalent aglycones of isorhamnetin at 11.70 (3.32), kaempferol at 0.60 (0.17), catechin at 1.93 (0.55), quercetin at 0.72 (0.20), and epicatechin at 0.85 (0.24) mg/100 g of fresh weight (mg/oz serving), respectively. These data can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action underlying the relationship between almond consumption and health-related outcomes and provide values for whole and blanched almonds suitable for inclusion in nutrient databases.","776.0"
"Lignan contents of Dutch plant foods: a database including lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol","15877880.0","Enterolignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) can potentially reduce the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Enterolignans are formed by the intestinal microflora after the consumption of plant lignans. Until recently, only secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol were considered enterolignan precursors, but now several new precursors have been identified, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol have a high degree of conversion. Quantitative data on the contents in foods of these new enterolignan precursors are not available. Thus, the aim of this study was to compile a lignan database including all four major enterolignan precursors. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in eighty-three solid foods and twenty-six beverages commonly consumed in The Netherlands. The richest source of lignans was flaxseed (301,129 microg/100 g), which contained mainly secoisolariciresinol. Also, lignan concentrations in sesame seeds (29,331 microg/100 g, mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol) were relatively high. For grain products, which are known to be important sources of lignan, lignan concentrations ranged from 7 to 764 microg/100 g. However, many vegetables and fruits had similar concentrations, because of the contribution of lariciresinol and pinoresinol. Brassica vegetables contained unexpectedly high levels of lignans (185-2321 microg/100 g), mainly pinoresinol and lariciresinol. Lignan levels in beverages varied from 0 (cola) to 91 microg/100 ml (red wine). Only four of the 109 foods did not contain a measurable amount of lignans, and in most cases the amount of lariciresinol and pinoresinol was larger than that of secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol. Thus, available databases largely underestimate the amount of enterolignan precursors in foods.","777.0"
"Antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin contents of selected commercially available cocoa-containing and chocolate products in the United States","16719535.0","In the United States, commercially available foods, including cocoa and chocolate, are being marketed with statements referring to the level of antioxidant activity and polyphenols. For cocoa-containing foods, there has been no comprehensive survey of the content of these and other chemistries. A survey of cocoa and chocolate-containing products marketed in the United States was conducted to determine antioxidant activity and polyphenol and procyanidin contents. Commercially available samples consisted of the top market share products in each of the following six categories: natural cocoa, unsweetened baking chocolate, dark chocolate, semisweet baking chips, milk chocolate, and chocolate syrup. Composite samples were characterized using four different methods: oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), vitamin C equivalence antioxidant capacity (VCEAC), total polyphenols, and procyanidins. All composite lots were further characterized for percent nonfat cocoa solids (NFCS) and percent fat. Natural cocoas had the highest levels of antioxidant activities, total polyphenols, and procyanidins followed by baking chocolates, dark chocolates and baking chips, and finally milk chocolate and syrups. The results showed a strong linear correlation between NFCS and ORAC (R (2) = 0.9849), total polyphenols (R (2) = 0.9793), and procyanidins (R (2) = 0.946), respectively. On the basis of principal component analysis, 81.4% of the sample set was associated with NFCS, antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, and procyanidins. The results indicated that, regardless of the product category, NFCS were the primary factor contributing to the level of cocoa antioxidants in the products tested. Results further suggested that differences in cocoa bean blends and processing, with the possible exception of Dutching, are minor factors in determining the level of antioxidants in commercially available cocoa-containing products in the United States.","778.0"

Notably, CRCW exhibited the highest concentrations of citric acid, didymin, rutin, isoquercitrin, nobiletin, and limonin, and the greatest antioxidant activities. Furthermore, CSOTW displayed the highest total antioxidant capacity, and the maximum concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzoic, ferulic acids, naringenin, hesperetin, luteolin, and quercitrin, along with a rich array of volatile compounds. Synephrine, <i>N</i>-methyltyramine, and gentisic acid were predominantly abundant in CSONW. However, with a few significant exceptions, CRDW and CSOJW did not exhibit noteworthy bioactive compounds, volatile components, or antioxidant activities.

"Capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry quantitative determination of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol in human urine after olive oil intake","11412007.0","Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated antioxidant properties of some virgin olive oil phenolic compounds. One of the prerequisites to extrapolate these data to an in vivo situation is the knowledge of their bioavailability in humans. In the present work we describe an analytical method which enables us to perform hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol quantitative determinations in human urine. This method was successfully used in bioavailability studies of both phenolic compounds after acute olive oil administration. Virgin olive oil was administered to healthy volunteers after a low phenolic diet. The dose administered of both phenolic compounds was estimated in reference to free forms of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol present in virgin olive oil extracts before and after being submitted to hydrolytic conditions. These conditions mimic those occurring during digestion. Urine samples were collected before and after acute olive oil intake and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol urinary recovery increased in response to olive oil administration, obtaining maximal values in the first 4 h. Our results further indicate that hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol are mainly excreted in conjugated form, since only 5.9 +/- 1.4% (hydroxytyrosol) and 13.8 +/- 5.4% (tyrosol) of the total amounts excreted in urine were in free form.","780.0"

In-tube SPME is a new extraction technique for organic compounds in aqueous samples, in which analytes are extracted from the sample directly into an open tubular capillary by repeated draw/eject cycles of sample solution. Daidzein, genistein and their glucosides tested in this study were clearly separated within 8 min by HPLC using an XDB-C8 column with diode array detection. In order to optimize the extraction of these compounds, several in-tube SPME parameters were examined. The glucosides daidzin and genistin were analyzed as aglycones after hydrolysis because the glucosides were not concentrated by in-tube SPME. The optimum extraction conditions for daidzein and genistein were obtained with 20 draw/eject cycles of 40 microl of sample using a Supel-Q porous layer open tubular capillary column. The extracted compounds were easily desorbed from the capillary by mobile phase flow, and carryover was not observed. Using the in-tube SPME-HPLC method, the calibration curves of these compounds were linear in the range 5-200 ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient above 0.9999 (n = 18), and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were 0.4-0.5 ng/ml. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of soybean foods without interference peaks. The recoveries of aglycones and glucosides spiked into food samples were above 97%.","782.0"

"Organic and phenolic acids in beer","","<title>Abstract</title>  <p>Background Girdling influences flowering and fruiting in perennial fruit trees by altering assimilate partitioning and hormonal signaling. However, its mechanistic basis in mango, including the widely grown cultivar ‘Dashehari,’ remains elusive. In this study, the effects of branch girdling on hormonal regulation, metabolic changes, phenolic regulation, nutrient dynamics influencing flowering, and fruit quality were investigated in 20-year-old mango trees. Results Girdling significantly enhanced flower induction, panicle length, and fruit set. Girdled branches produced more than twice the number of panicles (14.90 vs. 6.50 per branch) with longer inflorescences (27.99 vs. 22.18 cm) and nearly doubled the fruit set (10.79% vs. 5.60%) compared to non-girdled controls. Hormonal profiling revealed localized increases in IAA, 2iP, and ABA, and a marked reduction in GA₃ in response to girdling. Girdling increased the levels of epicatechin, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, and p-coumaric acid, which were strongly correlated with floral traits and hormone dynamics. Metabolite analyses further indicated enhanced accumulation of sucrose, glucose, fructose, organic acids, and stress-related compounds in girdled branches. Girdling also reduced the concentrations of P, K, Mg, Zn, Cu, and Mn, while Ca and Fe were maintained or slightly increased. Fruits from girdled branches were heavier, had higher pulp weight and firmness, and showed higher TSS and acidity. Significant increases in phenols, flavonoids, and carotenoids indicated improved nutritional and functional quality of fruits from girdled branches. Overall, these findings demonstrate that girdling modulates hormonal, metabolic, and nutritional pathways to improve the flowering, fruit set, and fruit quality in mango cv. Dashehari. Conclusions The study provides new insights into the physiological underpinnings of girdling in ‘Dashehari’ mango and highlights its potential as a practical orchard management tool to regulate flowering, enhance fruit yield, and fruit quality. Future work should focus on cultivar-specific responses and molecular mechanisms underlying these regulatory shifts in girdled branches and fruits.</p>","789.0"
"Characterization of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil and their effect on the formation of carcinogenic/mutagenic heterocyclic amines in a model system","11513697.0","Mutagenic heterocyclic amines (HAs) are formed at low levels during cooking of meat and fish, and some of them are considered to be possible human carcinogens. The formation of HAs may be affected by the presence of synthetic or naturally occurring antioxidants. In the present study the effect of virgin olive oil (VOO) phenolic compounds, identified and quantified by LC-MS, on the formation of HAs in a model system was evaluated. An aqueous solution of creatinine, glucose, and glycine was heated in the presence of two samples of VOO differing only in the composition of phenolic compounds. The addition of VOO to the model system inhibited the formation of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (IQx), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), and 2-amino-3,7,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (DiMeIQx) by between 30 and 50% compared with the control. Fresh-made olive oil, which contained a high amount of dihydroxyphenylethanol derivatives, inhibited HA formation more than a 1-year-old oil did. The inhibition of HA formation was also verified using phenolic compounds extracted from VOO.","790.0"
"Accumulation of quercetin conjugates in blood plasma after the short-term ingestion of onion by women","10938233.0","Quercetin is a typical flavonoid present mostly as glycosides in plant foods; it has attracted much attention for its potential beneficial effects in disease prevention. In this study, we examined human volunteers after the short-term ingestion of onion, a vegetable rich in quercetin glucosides. The subjects were served diets containing onion slices (quercetin equivalent: 67.6-93.6 mg/day) with meals for 1 wk. Quercetin was only found in glucuronidase-sulfatase-treated plasma, and its concentration after 10 h of fasting increased from 0.04 +/- 0.04 microM before the trial to 0.63 +/- 0.72 microM after the 1-wk trial. The quercetin content in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) after glucuronidase-sulfatase treatment corresponded to <1% of the alpha-tocopherol content. Human LDL isolated from the plasma after the trial showed little improvement of its resistance to copper ion-induced oxidation. It is therefore concluded that conjugated metabolites of quercetin accumulate exclusively in human blood plasma in the concentration range of 10(-7) approximately 10(-6) M after the short-term ingestion of vegetables rich in quercetin glucosides, although these metabolites are hardly incorporated into plasma LDL.","791.0"
"Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the isoflavone biochanin A in rats","17025260.0","Biochanin A (BCA) is a dietary isoflavone present in legumes, most notably red clover, and in many herbal dietary supplements. BCA has been reported to have chemopreventive properties and is metabolized to the isoflavone genistein (GEN), BCA conjugates, and GEN conjugates. The metabolites may contribute to the chemopreventive effects of BCA. The absorption, metabolism, and disposition of BCA have not been determined in rats. Our objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered BCA by intravenous injection (1 and 5 mg/kg), by intraperitoneal injection (5 and 50 mg/kg), and orally (5 and 50 mg/kg). Plasma and bile samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed in vitro to determine conjugate concentrations for BCA and GEN. Equilibrium dialysis was used to determine protein binding. The BCA and GEN concentrations in plasma, urine, and bile were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The pharmacokinetic parameters of BCA were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. Significant levels of BCA conjugates and GEN conjugates were detected in plasma and bile. Both BCA and GEN were found to have a high clearance and a large apparent volume of distribution; the bioavailability of both was poor (<4%). Reentry peaks were evident after oral administration of both BCA and GEN, suggesting enterohepatic cycling. The free fraction of BCA in rat plasma was 1.5%. A 2-compartment model that included both linear and nonlinear clearance terms and enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first evaluation of the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics and metabolism of BCA in rats.","792.0"
"Quercetin pharmacokinetics in humans","18241083.0","The purpose of this study was to examine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin aglycone as well as its conjugated metabolites and to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for quercetin that incorporates enterohepatic recirculation. The stability of quercetin in different matrices at various temperatures and pH, and the quercetin content of six capsules of the herbal preparation Quercetin-500 Plus were determined by HPLC. Subjects received quercetin 500 mg three times daily and blood and urine samples were obtained. The concentration of quercetin aglycone and conjugated metabolites were assayed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin. A population compartment model incorporating input from the gallbladder was developed to account for the enterohepatic recirculation observed with quercetin. The oral clearance (CL/F) was high (3.5 x 10(4)l/h) with an average terminal half-life of 3.5 h for quercetin. The plasma concentration versus time curves exhibited re-entry peaks. A one-compartment model that included enterohepatic recirculation best described the plasma data. This represents the first comprehensive evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and enterohepatic recirculation of quercetin in humans. Population pharmacokinetic models adapted for enterohepatic recirculation allowed an assessment of the magnitude and frequency of the enterohepatic recirculation process.","793.0"
"Simultaneous determination of daidzein, equol, genistein and bisphenol A in human urine by a fast and simple method using SPE and GC-MS","17579895.0","Human diet contains weakly estrogenic compounds such as daidzein (DAI) and genistein (GEN), phytoestrogens present in soy and many vegetables as well as bisphenol A (BPA), a contaminant from packing materials and plastic containers for foods and beverages. In light of concerns about hormonally active agents, biomonitoring methods are needed to assess human exposure to such compounds. A method for simultaneous determination of DAI, its metabolite equol (EQ), GEN, and BPA by GC-MS analysis was established, validated and applied to measure concentrations in human urine. Sample preparation involves enzymatic conjugate cleavage, SPE and derivatization by silylation. For GC/MS analysis, deuterated DAI and GEN and( 13)C-BPA are used as internal standards. LOD are 4, 4, 5 and 3 ng/mL urine for DAI, EQ, GEN and BPA, respectively. Interassay variations were 9% for DAI, 15% for EQ, 18% for GEN and 10% for BPA. Simple workup and accuracy of the method are suited for biomonitoring. An analysis of urine samples from 15 adults consuming typical German food revealed dietary exposure to phytoestrogens in all samples: GEN concentrations ranged between 13 and 238 ng/mL, those for DAI ranged from 12 to 356 ng/mL. More than half of the individuals excreted also the more estrogenic metabolite EQ, at levels of 8-128 ng/mL. Higher concentrations (GEN: 820, DAI: 960 and EQ: 1740 ng/mL) were measured in a 24 h urine sample upon ingestion of soy protein (50 g with 12.9 mg DAI and 25.2 mg GEN). Only urine collected after some days on strict phytoestrogen-free diet had undetectable isoflavone levels. BPA was detected in 9 of 15 urine samples ranging from 3 to 11 ng/mL, and at 55 ng/mL in one sample. In conclusion, a reliable method to determine BPA and isoflavones in urine was established and applied in a pilot study: Biomonitoring results show much higher dietary exposure to phytoestrogens than to BPA in German adults.","794.0"
"Phenolic content and antioxidant activity of tortillas produced from pigmented maize processed by conventional nixtamalization or extrusion cooking","","The effects of traditional nixtamalization and extrusion cooking on total phenolics, ferulic acid, anthocyanins and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) of Mexican pigmented (blue and red) and commercial (white and yellow) maize processed into tortillas were investigated. Tortillas prepared from extruded flours retained between 76.2–93.9% and 58–96.7% of total phenolics and total ferulic acid (TFA) respectively, compared to 50.5–75.7% and 19.6–55.8% assayed in traditional tortillas. Approximately 97–99% of TFA in raw kernels and their tortillas was in its bound form. The retention of TFA in traditional tortillas was significantly lower compared to tortillas from extruded flours. Traditional tortillas contained more free ferulic acid compared to tortillas produced from extruded flours indicating that the first process liberated bound ferulic acid with cell walls more efficiently. Blue maize lost more than 55% of the anthocyanins when processed into extruded or traditional tortillas. Approximately 68–92% of the ORAC associated with raw kernels or their tortillas was due to bound compounds. Traditional and extruded tortillas lost 16.4–52.4% and 6.8–24.8%, respectively, of the total ORAC associated with raw grains. Results clearly indicate that the proposed lime-cooking extrusion strategy was instrumental in retaining higher levels of phytochemicals, particularly ferulic acid, and antioxidants in all tortillas.","795.0"

The analytical method is based on liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry in multiple reaction monitoring mode, using deuterated genistein as internal standard. The identified metabolites were genistein and dihydrodaidzein (DHD); their average concentrations in serum were 0.71 and 0.21 microM, respectively, for animals fed 1.5 mg/day of genistein and 0.7 mg/day of daidzein. This method assured a limit of quantification of 0.04 microM for genistein and 0.08 microM for DHD, and a limit of detection of 0.018 microM for genistein and 0.035 microM for DHD. The coefficient of variation was 8.9% for genistein and lower than 15% for DHD. This study provides the first data indicating the presence of dihydrodaidzein in serum of mice fed diets containing soy proteins.","797.0"
"Contribution of chlorogenic acids to the iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages","15740013.0","The iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages was determined by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The influence on FRAP due to the degree of roasting (light, medium, and dark), species (Coffea arabica and Coffea robusta), and caffeine content (regular and decaffeinated) was investigated using ground and soluble coffee samples. The concentration of specific chlorogenic acids and caffeine in the beverages was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and related to FRAP using Pearson correlation coefficients. All measurements were expressed per unit of soluble solids. Beverages prepared with ground coffee had, on average, 27% higher FRAP values than those prepared with soluble coffee (p < 0.05). In the former beverages, FRAP of C. robusta samples was significantly higher (on average, 50.3%) when compared to that of C. arabica samples, and FRAP values decreased with increasing degree of roasting (p < 0.05). A strong correlation (r > 0.91) was found between FRAP and the total content of chlorogenic acids, particularly that of the caffeoylquinic acid isomers. The iron-reducing activity of coffee beverages was not influenced by caffeine.","798.0"

The level in the phenolic content of olive drupes declines rapidly during the black maturation phase. A general decreasing trend was observed too in the phenolic content of olive oils during the ripening process in the three varieties studied. Important differences in the high-performance liquid chromatography profile between varieties were observed. These included the presence of very low amounts of lignans in olive oils proceeding from the Morrut cultivar, and the presence of three peaks after elution of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA in the Farga and Morrut cultivars, which could be used as differentiating parameters. Sensory profile differences were observed between olive cultivars and due to the ripening process.","799.0"

The values of alkylresorcinols and lignans in common foods and beverages were collected from scientific publications in refereed journals, and other foods particularly consumed in Spain, for which values were not available, were analyzed by standardized protocols and included into the database. The Alignia database presents the content of alkylresorcinols in 88 food items and the lignan content of 593 foods and beverages. Using the database, the intake of lignans in Spain, calculated using data from the Food Composition Panel based on household consumption, was estimated to be 0.76 mg/day.","801.0"
"Determination of piceid and resveratrol in Spanish wines deriving from Monastrell (Vitis vinifera L.) grape variety","15315376.0","The presence of stilbenes in wine is becoming an important issue due to their claimed relation to a low incidence in coronary diseases and their increasing implication as cancer chemopreventive and neuroprotective agents. Total resveratrol content, quantified as glucoside and aglycone forms of resveratrol, has been determined in a survey of 45 Monastrell monovarietal Spanish red wine types (around 135 wine samples), belonging to Alicante and Bullas appellations. The average between ratio glucoside/aglycone forms of resveratrol in these wines was considerably high, ranging from 82 to 91% of resveratrol in its glycosidic form. This characteristic was observed in a high percentage of the studied wines, which were made under different winemaking procedures, and from different vintages (1995-2002). In addition, wines made using macerative fermentations with double amount of solid parts (""doble pasta"") reached the highest levels of total stilbene content expressed as resveratrol equivalent, i.e., 30 mg/L (average of 18.8 mg/L). It can be concluded that high resveratrol glucoside concentration and low free isomer content can be considered characteristics of the Monastrell variety, as it happens to red wines deriving from other varieties grown at warm climates. This fact, also observed for other French and Portuguese red varieties, might play an important role in food habits involving these types of wines.","802.0"

Fruit size was highly correlated (r = 0.84) with ACY within Vaccinium corymbosum L., but was not correlated to ACY across eight other Vaccinium species, or within 27 blackberry hybrids. Certain Vaccinium and Ribes fruits with pigmented flesh were lower in ACY, TPH, ORAC, and FRAP compared to those values in berries with nonpigmented flesh. ORAC values ranged from 19 to 131 micromol Trolox equivalents/g in Vaccinium, from 13 to 146 in Rubus, and from 17 to 116 in Ribes. Though ACY may indicate TPH, the range observed in ACY/TPH ratios precludes prediction of ACY from TPH and vice versa for a single genotype. In general, TPH was more highly correlated to antioxidant capacity than ACY was. This study demonstrates the wide diversity of phytochemical levels and antioxidant capacities within and across three genera of small fruit.","808.0"

"Genotype and environmental variation in phenolic content, phenolic acid composition, and antioxidant activity of hard spring wheat","16478246.0","The health-promoting effects of whole-grain wheat likely derive from phenolic compounds and other antioxidants that also make wheat a potential source of functional food ingredients. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of genotype and growing environment on the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities of alcohol-soluble extracts from commercial wheat cultivars. Total phenolic contents (TPCs), antioxidant activities (AOAs), and concentrations of six phenolic acids were measured in six red- and white-grained hard spring wheat genotypes grown at four diverse locations in Western Canada during the 2003 crop year. There were significant differences among genotypes and environments for TPC, AOA, and concentrations of all the phenolic acids measured. The predominant indicators of antioxidant potential, i.e., TPC, AOA, and ferulic acid (FA) concentration were highly intercorrelated (r > 0.72). For these indices, the Canada Western (CW) Red Spring wheat cultivars Neepawa and AC Elsa had the highest levels, whereas an analogous CW hard white spring wheat cultivar, AC Snowbird, had the lowest levels. Grain color did not appear to be a factor in the expression of antioxidant-related parameters. For both TPC and AOA, as well as for vanillic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid, environmental effects were considerably larger than genotype effects. Neither growing temperature nor rainfall from anthesis to maturity appeared to be related to the environmental variation that was observed. Genotype x environment interaction was small for all parameters compared with genotype and location effects and was significant only for TPC. Genotype variation for antioxidant properties indicates that it would be possible to select for these quantitative traits in a breeding program. However, the significant environmental variation observed would delay and/or complicate this process.","812.0"
"Effect of drying conditions on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.)","","The effect of air-drying parameters on antioxidant activity and changes in antioxidant compounds of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) were studied. Broccoli samples were dried to 70 g kg⁻¹ moisture content using temperatures ranging from 50 to 100 °C and air flow-rates from 1.20 to 2.25 m s⁻¹, resulting in drying times from 25 to 90 min. Temperature, owing to its positive effect on the oxidation kinetics, was negatively correlated with ascorbic acid and free and total polyphenol contents but not with kaempferol, even though the sample dried at the highest temperature showed the lowest kaempferol content. The air flow-rate was positively correlated with the total (TPP) and free (FPP) polyphenol contents because it led to a reduction in the drying time. No correlation was found between air flow-rate and kaempferol content. Air flow-rate and temperature positively affected the antioxidant activity by reducing the drying time. High-temperature, short-time processes maximised the antioxidant activity of broccoli owing to the negative effect of drying time on antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of broccoli was positively and significantly correlated with the FPP content but not with TPP and kaempferol. The evaluation of hydroxymethylfurfural content as an indicator of the occurrence of a Maillard reaction in dried broccoli did not support the hypothesis of a contribution of MRPs to the antioxidant activity of dried broccoli.","813.0"

"Evaluation of lignans and free and linked hydroxy-tyrosol and tyrosol in extra virgin olive oil after hydrolysis processes","","We describe chemical hydrolytic procedures to evaluate the total amount of tyrosol and hydroxy-tyrosol free and/or linked to secoiridoidic molecules (acid hydrolysis). At the same time a rapid determination of the lignans in complex minor polar compound (MPC) extracts is proposed (alkaline hydrolysis). High-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detection (HPLC/DAD) and HPLC/MS were applied as reference methods to evaluate the quantitative results from the hydrolysis experiments. The optimized acid hydrolysis procedures were first applied to an oleuropein standard and then to MPC fractions extracted from several commercial extra virgin olive oils. The results confirm the applicability of the method, consisting in the acid hydrolysis of complex mixtures of secoiridoidic derivatives, to determine the antioxidant potential in terms of MPC. These data can contribute to forecasting the potential ageing resistance of an extra virgin olive oil in terms of antioxidant potency. Finally, alkaline hydrolysis allows confirmation and easy determination of the amount of lignans, especially in those MPC fractions which are particularly complex.","818.0"

Recent studies have detected flavonol conjugates in blood and urine following various dietary interventions. To assess to what extent flavonols also accumulate in tissues, where they might be expected to exert anti-carcinogenic and anti-atherogenic effects, [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was synthesized and fed to rats. After 60 min, 93.6% of the ingested radioactivity was recovered from the intestine, incorporated into 18 metabolites that had undergone deglycosylation followed by varying degrees of glucuronidation, methylation, and/or sulfation. [(14)C]Quercetin, the aglycon of the radiolabeled substrate, was present in the intestine and in trace amounts in the liver but was not detected in the plasma and kidneys. The original [2-(14)C]quercetin-4'-glucoside was detected exclusively in the intestine, where it accounted for only 26.2% of the radioactivity. The remainder of the recovered radioactivity was located mainly in the plasma, liver, and kidneys as (14)C-labeled metabolites. However, compared to the quantities in the gastrointestinal tract, the levels of metabolites in plasma and body tissues were very low, indicating only limited absorption into the blood stream. The data demonstrate that quercetin-4'-glucoside, which is a major flavonol in onions, undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism in the intestine, and this appears not to be associated to any extent with transport across the gut wall into the blood stream.","819.0"

The antioxidant capacity of the fresh fruit and the levels of vitamin C and phenolics were not affected by freezing. When fruit were stored at 4 degrees C for 3 days and then at 18 degrees C for 24 h, mimicking the route fresh fruit takes after harvest to the supermarket and onto the consumer's table, anthocyanin levels were unaffected while vitamin C levels declined and those of elligitannins increased, and overall, there was no effect on the antioxidant capacity of the fruit. It is concluded, therefore, that freshly picked, fresh commercial, and frozen raspberries all contain similar levels of phytochemicals and antioxidants per serving.","820.0"

"Absorption, excretion and metabolite profiling of methyl-, glucuronyl-, glucosyl- and sulpho-conjugates of quercetin in human plasma and urine after ingestion of onions","16869998.0","It is essential to have a thorough knowledge of the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary flavonols to understand their role in disease prevention. Lightly fried onions containing 275 micromol flavonols, principally quercetin-4'-glucoside and quercetin-3,4'-diglucoside, were fed to healthy human volunteers and plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Samples were analysed by HPLC with diode array and tandem mass spectrometric detection. Five flavonol metabolites, quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide, a quercetin diglucuronide and a quercetin glucuronide sulphate, were detected in plasma in quantifiable amounts with trace quantities of six additional quercetin metabolites. Sub-micromolar peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide, isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were observed 0.6-0.8 h after ingestion. In contrast, the Cmax of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 2.5 h. The elimination half-lives (t1/2) of quercetin-3'-sulphate, quercetin-3-glucuronide and quercetin diglucuronide were 1.71, 2.33 and 1.76 h respectively, while the t1/2 of isorhamnetin-3-glucuronide was 5.34 h and that of quercetin glucuronide sulphate was 4.54 h. The profile of metabolites excreted in urine was markedly different to that of plasma with many of the major urinary components, including quercetin-3'-glucuronide, two quercetin glucoside sulphates and a methylquercetin diglucuronide, absent or present in only trace amounts in the bloodstream indicative of substantial phase II metabolism. Total urinary excretion of quercetin metabolites was 12.9 micromol, corresponding to 4.7 % of intake. If these samples had been subjected to hydrolysis, as in many previous studies, only quercetin and isorhamnetin would have been detected and quantified. The bioactivity of these metabolites should be considered.","822.0"
"Bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones in humans: impact of a full-fat yogurt","19007165.0","The bioavailability of dietary phytochemicals may be influenced by the food matrix in which they are consumed. In this study the impact of a full-fat yogurt on the bioavailability and metabolism of orange juice flavanones was investigated. Human plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period after the consumption of 250 mL of orange juice containing a total of 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 12 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside, with and without 150 mL of full-fat yogurt. The juice also contained 1 g of paracetamol and 5 g of lactulose. HPLC-MS(2) analysis revealed the accumulation of hesperetin-7-O-glucuronide, and an unassigned hesperetin-O-glucuronide metabolite in plasma reached a peak concentration (C(max)) of 924 +/- 224 nmol/L, 4.4 +/- 0.5 h (T(max)) after orange juice ingestion. The T(max) is indicative of absorption in the colon. When the juice was consumed with yogurt, neither the C(max) at 661 +/- 170 nmol/L nor the T(max) at 5.1 +/- 0.4 h were significantly different from those obtained with juice alone. The two hesperetin glucuronides were also excreted in urine along with a third hesperetin-O-glucuronide, two hesperetin-O-glucuronide-O-sulfates, a hesperetin-O-diglucuronide, a naringenin-O-diglucuronide, and, tentatively identified, naringenin-7-O-glucuronide and naringenin-4'-O-glucuronide. This indicates the occurrence of substantial, postabsorption, phase II metabolism prior to urinary excretion. The quantity of flavanone metabolites excreted 0-5 h after orange juice ingestion was significantly reduced by yogurt, but over the full 0-24 h urine collection period, the amounts excreted, corresponding to ca. 7.0% of intake, were not affected by the addition of yogurt to the drink. Nor did yogurt have a significant effect on gastric emptying, as determined by plasma paracetamol levels, or on the mouth to cecum transit time of the head of the meal, assessed by measurement of lactulose-derived breath hydrogen. There is also a discussion of the merits of studies of the absorption and metabolism of flavanones based on direct analysis of metabolites by HPLC-MS and the more traditional indirect approach where samples are treated with a mollusc glucuronidase/sulfatase preparation prior to HPLC analysis of the released aglycones.","823.0"

The main metabolite, a pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, reached a peak plasma concentration ( C max) of 274 +/- 24 nmol/L after 1.1 +/- 0.4 h ( t max) when only strawberries were ingested. When the strawberries were eaten with cream, the C max was not statistically different but the t max at 2.4 +/- 0.5 h was delayed significantly ( p < 0.001). The pelargonidin- O-glucuronide, along with smaller quantities of other metabolites, was also excreted in urine in quantities corresponding to ca. 1% of anthocyanin intake. The quantities excreted over the 0-24 h collection period were not influenced significantly by cream. However, the 0-2 h excretion of anthocyanin metabolites was significantly lower when the strawberries were eaten with cream, whereas the reverse occurred during with the 5-8 h excretion period. In keeping with these observations, measurement of plasma paracetamol and breath hydrogen revealed that cream delayed gastric emptying and extended mouth to cecum transit time.","824.0"

"Absorption of phenolic acids in humans after coffee consumption","12236707.0","Despite extensive literature describing the biological effects of polyphenols, little is known about their absorption from diet, one major unresolved point consisting of the absorption of the bound forms of polyphenols. In this view, in the present work we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from coffee, a common beverage particularly rich in bound phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid. Coffee brew was analyzed for free and total (free + bound) phenolic acids. Chlorogenic acid (5'-caffeoylquinic acid), a bound form of caffeic acid, was present in coffee at high levels, while free phenolic acids were undetectable. After alkaline hydrolysis, which released bound phenolic acids, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and high levels of caffeic acid were detected. Plasma samples were collected before and 1 and 2 h after coffee administration and analyzed for free and total phenolic acid content. Two different procedures were applied to release bound phenolic acids in plasma: beta-glucuronidase treatment and alkaline hydrolysis. Coffee administration resulted in increased total plasma caffeic acid concentration, with an absorption peak at 1 h. Caffeic acid was the only phenolic acid found in plasma samples after coffee administration, while chlorogenic acid was undetectable. Most of caffeic acid was present in plasma in bound form, mainly in the glucuronate/sulfate forms. Due to the absence of free caffeic acid in coffee, plasma caffeic acid is likely to be derived from hydrolysis of chlorogenic acid in the gastrointestinal tract.","833.0"

"Determination of free and bound phenolic acids in beer","","This study examined the effects of malt roasting degree on the chemical composition, aroma profile, antioxidant activity, and sensory attributes of brewed beer. Roasting increased carbohydrate content, diastatic power, and Maillard products such as melanoidins and Amadori compounds, contributing to deeper color and enhanced antioxidant activity. Aroma profiling with an electronic nose revealed that roasting shifted key volatile classes, including esters, terpenes, pyrazines, and sulfur compounds. Light malt beer retained fruity esters (for example, ethyl hexanoate and cis-3-hexenyl acetate), whereas dark malt beer was enriched in Maillard-derived pyrazines and aldehydes (for example, 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, furfural, maltol) that impart roasted and caramelized notes. Liquid malt beer showed the greatest loss of monoterpenes (for example, γ-terpinene), indicating thermal degradation. These changes aligned with antioxidant capacity, as melanoidin- and pyrazine-rich profiles enhanced radical scavenging. Overall, roasting modulated sensory and antioxidant properties through Maillard-derived transformations, underscoring their impact on beer quality.","835.0"
"Phenolic acids from beer are absorbed and extensively metabolized in humans","16242314.0","In spite of the wide literature describing the biological effects of phenolic compounds, scarce data are available on their absorption from diet. In the present work, we studied the absorption in humans of phenolic acids from beer, a common beverage rich in different phenolic acids with related chemical structures. Beer was analyzed for free and total (free+bound) phenolic acids. Ferulic, caffeic and sinapic acids were present in beer mainly as bound forms, while 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid and p-coumaric acid were present mainly as free forms. Vanillic acid was present equally in the free and bound forms. Plasma samples were collected before and 30 and 60 min after beer administration and analyzed for free and conjugated phenolic acid content. A significant two- to fourfold increase in plasma levels of phenolic acids was detected with peak concentrations at 30 min after beer ingestion. 4-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid was present in plasma mainly as nonconjugated forms while p-coumaric acid was present equally as nonconjugated and conjugated forms. Ferulic, vanillic and caffeic acids were present in plasma predominantly as conjugated forms, with a slight prevalence of sulfates with respect to glucuronates. Our results indicate that phenolic acids from beer are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are present in blood after being largely metabolized to the form of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. The extent of conjugation is related to the chemical structure of phenolic acids: the monohydroxy derivatives showing the lowest conjugation degree and the dihydroxy derivatives showing the highest one.","836.0"
"Microwave and Traditional Cooking Methods: Effect of Cooking on Antioxidant Capacity and Phenolic Compounds Content of Seven Vegetables","","The effect of microwave, boiling and pressure cooking on total antioxidant capacity and total phenolics content of seven vegetables were studied. Total phenolics in raw and cooked vegetables were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, whereas the total antioxidant capacity of vegetables extracts was evaluated using the Crocin method. After boiling, four out of seven vegetables (cauliflower, peas, spinach and Swiss chard) showed a significant decrease in their total phenolic content (P < 0.05). No decrease or a smaller decrease was observed for these four vegetables (P < 0.05) after pressure cooking and/or microwaving than after boiling. The total antioxidant capacity of potato and Swiss chard was not significantly affected by cooking procedures, whereas it decreased for spinach and peas, and it increased for tomato and carrots (P < 0.05). In addition, there was a statistically significant correlation between total phenolic content and total antioxidant capacity in cooked and uncooked vegetables, but the strength of the correlation increased when separating carotenoid-poor from carotenoid-rich vegetables. All guidelines for a healthy nutrition include recommendation for increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables also because of their phenolic compounds content and antioxidant capacity. However, all studies correlating antioxidants consumption and health benefits relate food consumption studies with antioxidant capacity of foods, neglecting to consider the chemical composition changes that may occur during cooking. This study provides data in order to better understand the implication on the total antioxidant capacity of foods due to different cooking approaches.","837.0"

"Changes in the contents of antioxidant compounds in pepper fruits at different ripening stages, as affected by salinity","","The interest in the consumption of pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum L.) is, to a large extent, due to its content of bioactive nutrients and their importance as dietary antioxidants. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to determine the effects of salinity and different ripening states of pepper fruits on several compounds with antioxidant properties. Fruits from plants grown under three saline treatments (0, 15, and 30 mM NaCl) were collected at three maturity states (green, turning, and red). Antioxidant activity in the hydrophilic (HAA) and lipophilic (LAA) fractions, lycopene, beta-carotene, ascorbic acid, total phenolic compounds and reducing sugars were determined. From the nutritional point of view, the red state was the most appropriate state of maturation, since red peppers had the highest levels of lycopene, beta-carotene, and sugars and the highest antioxidant activity for both hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions. The effect of salinity depended on the maturity state of the peppers: it had no effect on HAA, beta-carotene or sugars, but decreased ascorbic acid and total phenolic compounds, and increased LAA and lycopene. The use of a moderately-saline water was beneficial when peppers were harvested in the red state, by increasing HAA and LAA in fruits, with no significant effects on other parameters.","841.0"

Chocolate is a natural cocoa bean-based product that reportedly contains high levels of monomeric, oligomeric, and polymeric catechins. We have applied solid-liquid extraction and liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry to the identification and determination of the predominant monomeric catechins, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, in a baking chocolate Standard Reference Material (NIST Standard Reference Material 2384). (+)-Catechin and (-)-epicatechin are detected and quantified in chocolate extracts on the basis of selected-ion monitoring of their protonated [M + H](+) molecular ions. Tryptophan methyl ester is used as an internal standard. The developed method has the capacity to accurately quantify as little as 0.1 microg/mL (0.01 mg of catechin/g of chocolate) of either catechin in chocolate extracts, and the method has additionally been used to certify (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin levels in the baking chocolate Standard Reference Material.

The area under the curve (AUC) for total plasma hesperetin of subjects consuming hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was 2-fold higher than that of subjects consuming the ""low"" dose hesperidin juice [3.45+/-1.27 vs. 1.16+/-0.52 mmol/(L.h), respectively, P>0.0001]. The AUC for hesperetin after consuming the hesperetin-7-glucoside juice was improved to the level of the ""high"" dose hesperidin juice [4.16+/-1.50 mmol/(L.h)]. The peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) of hesperetin were 4-fold higher (2.60+/-1.07 mmol/L, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with those consuming ""low"" dose hesperidin juice (0.48 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and 1.5-fold higher than those consuming ""high"" dose hesperidin juice (1.05+/-0.25 mmol/L). The corresponding T(max) was much faster (0.6+/-0.1 h, P<0.0001) after subjects consumed hesperetin-7-glucoside juice compared with ""low"" dose (7.0+/-3.0 h) and ""high"" dose (7.4+/-2.0 h) hesperidin juices. The results of this study demonstrated that the bioavailability of hesperidin was modulated by enzymatic conversion to hesperetin-7-glucoside, thus changing the absorption site from the colon to the small intestine. This may affect future interventions concerning the health benefits of citrus flavonoids.","849.0"
"Oxidative metabolites of the mammalian lignans enterodiol and enterolactone in rat bile and urine","10898644.0","Recent studies have shown that the mammalian lignans enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL) are biotransformed in vitro by hepatic microsomes from rats and humans to various metabolites carrying one additional hydroxy group either at the aromatic or at the aliphatic moiety. To clarify whether these metabolites are also formed in vivo, each lignan was administered intraduodenally at a dose of 10 mg/kg of bw to bile duct-catheterized female Wistar rats and the 6 h bile analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. With END-dosed rats, three products of aromatic and two of aliphatic monohydroxylation were found, whereas six aromatic and five aliphatic monohydroxylated biliary metabolites were detected after administration of ENL. The metabolites hydroxylated at the aromatic rings were unequivocally identified by comparison with synthetic reference compounds. The structures of the in vivo metabolites arising from aliphatic hydroxylation could not be completely elucidated; they were identical with some of the formerly reported microsomal products according to GC retention times and mass spectra. Significant amounts of most of the metabolites of the mammalian lignans identified in bile were also found in the urine of female rats after oral administration of 10 mg/kg of bw END or ENL and in the urine of female and male Wistar rats after they had been fed a diet containing 5% flaxseed. Thus, the mammalian lignans END and ENL give rise to several hydroxylated metabolites in vivo, which may contribute to the biological effects of these important food constituents.","850.0"
"Furanocoumarins in Florida celery varieties increased by fungicide treatment","","Florida celery cultivars Florida 2-14, Florimart, M9, Florida 296, M68, and Junebelle contained total psoralen + bergapten + xanthotoxin + isopimpinellin ranging from about 12 to 50 micrograms/g. Treatment of the commercial Florida cultivar 2-14 with Bravo 500, Manzate-D, or Kocide 101 fungicides increased bergapten 2-4 times in leaves and stalk, xanthotoxin 2-3 times in stalk, and isopimpinellin about 2-3 times in leaves but did not increase psoralen levels. These increases represent increased calculated biological activity toward human skin. This is the first report of fungicide induction of furanocoumarins in celery.","851.0"
"Content of nutrients and lignans in roller milled fractions of rye","","Rye grain was roller milled into six flour fractions (607 g kg-1), a short (341 g kg-1) and a bran (52 g kg-1) in a Buhler laboratory mill. In the different flours (F1-F6) a progressive increase in ash (4-13 g kg-1), crude protein (39-87 g kg-1) and crude fat (5-17 g kg-1) concentration was found and a corresponding decrease in starch (853-699 g kg-1) concentration. Total dietary fibre (55-109 g kg-1) constituents and the lignans, matairesinol (0.05-0.22 mg kg-1) and secoisolariciresinol (0.21-0.38 mg kg-1), showed a different distribution with a maximal concentration in F5. The short and bran had higher concentrations of ash, crude protein, crude fat, dietary fibre components and lignans but a lower concentration of starch than the flours. Compared to the short, the bran contained more of all constituents analysed except mixed-linked beta-glucan and starch. A very high proportion of total dietary fibre components of the rye, such as arabinoxylan (72%), cellulose (76%) and Klason lignin (79%) as well as of matairesinol (87%) and secoisolariciresinol (73%), was found in the short and bran together.","852.0"
"Variation in the content of glucosinolates, hydroxycinnamic acids, carotenoids, total antioxidant capacity and low-molecular-weight carbohydrates in Brassica vegetables","","Bioactive compounds were investigated in genotypes (cauliflower 10, white cabbage 10, curly kale 1) and plant parts of the three crops. The content of most of the major glucosinolates glucobrassicin, sinigrin and glucoiberin differed significantly between cultivars. Samples harvested in 2000 had higher amounts of several glucosinolates than samples from 1999. Within cauliflower the buds of the floret had 1.5 to 2.5-fold higher concentration of glucobrassicin and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin than the stalk. In white cabbage several glucosinolates had their highest content in the outer leaves (up to 2-fold higher). Upper leaves of curly kale contained 5-fold more of total glucosinolates than lower leaves. Chlorogenic acid was the dominating hydroxycinnamate in curly kale, which also contained at least ten times more of carotenoids (mainly lutein) than white cabbage. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assayed with the FRAP method was 0.76 (0.06) micromole/g fw (mean (SD)) in water-soluble and 0.32 (0.04) in water-insoluble extracts of cauliflower which was 62-68% higher than in white cabbage. Curly kale contained 6.4 and 6.1 micromol/g fw TAC in water-soluble and water-insoluble extracts. TAC did not differ between plant parts. Progoitrin and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin were correlated to water-soluble TAC in white cabbage, probably reflecting a variation in other compounds. Cauliflower contained less glucose, fructose and sorbitol but more sucrose than white cabbage. Curly kale had lower contents of glucose (approximately 2 times), fructose (approximately 4-5 times) and sucrose (20 and 36 times, respectively) than cauliflower and white cabbage, while inositol was only found in curly kale. Storage of white cabbage reduced the amount of sorbitol and sucrose. The study shows that cultivar, plant part and storage affect the content of bioactive compounds in Brassica vegetables. The variation between years, as in cauliflower, is due to environmental factors. Since the cultivar ranking order was rather stable for several components the data could provide a basis for the selection of cultivars optimised for valuable health components for fresh market consumption.","853.0"
"Polyphenols and antioxidant capacity of vegetables under fresh and frozen conditions","12670160.0","The phenolic and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values have been measured in six fresh and frozen vegetables (beet green, spinach, broccoli, carrot, onion, and celery) from the same cultivar by analyzing the whole juice (WJ) and the acetonic extract of the squeezed pulp. To exploit the effect of the acid environment on the stability and recovery of the phenolics, perchloric acid (PCA) was added directly to WJ and to the pulp before the extraction with acetone. In both fresh and frozen vegetables, PCA markedly increased the recovery of phenolics extracted from the pulp, but PCA had no effect on the WJ. Four of six frozen vegetables showed lower phenolic and ORAC values than the fresh vegetables, whereas in the other two cases, values were significantly higher compared to fresh samples. Among the fresh vegetables, beet green showed the highest ORAC and phenolic values; however, when measured in two different cultivars of beet green, the ORAC value showed as much as 4.5-fold variation, whereas total phenolics and flavonoids showed 1.2- and 3.5-fold variations, respectively. The results show that total phenolics and ORAC, compared in fresh and frozen vegetables, represent an index of the mildness of blanching in the industry of frozen vegetables and provide a measure of the gap in antioxidants in the diet of people who consume frozen instead of fresh vegetables. The plant genotype is an important source of variability in the ORAC value, which can be conveniently used to increase the intake of antioxidants from vegetables.","854.0"
"Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition","15788119.0","Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1.5 % w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (SD 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (SD 300) ORAC units (micromol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order to prevent chronic diseases.","855.0"

Concentrations of polymethoxylated flavones (tangeretin, nobiletin, and sinensetin) and beta-cryptoxanthin in juice, and inhibitory activities against arachidonate cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases of the juice extract were analyzed. The juice processed by hand-press extraction contained the largest amounts of nobiletin (3.56 mg/100 mL), tangeretin (4.10 mg/100 mL), and sinensetin (0.13 mg/100 mL). Concentrations of beta-cryptoxanthin were 0.66, 0.59, 0.55, and 0.50 mg/100 mL in chopper pulper, in-line (5/64 in.), in-line (8/64 in.) and hand-press juices, respectively. Both extracts of in-line juices showed greater inhibitory activity toward platelet 12-lipoxygenase than the others. The inhibitory effect of hand-press juice extract on platelet cyclooxygenase activity was remarkable among juice extracts. All juice extracts effectively inhibited polymorphonuclear 5-lipoxygenase activity at nearly the same rate.","856.0"

"Determination of anthocyanidins in berries and red wine by high-performance liquid chromatography","11559107.0","A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of anthocyanidins from berries and red wine is described. Delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and malvidin contents of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), black currant (Ribes nigrum), strawberry (Fragaria ananassa cv. Jonsok), and a Cabernet sauvignon (Vitis vinifera) red wine were determined. The aglycon forms of the anthocyanins present in the samples were revealed by acid hydrolysis. A reversed phase analytical column was employed to separate the anthocyanidins before identification by diode array detection. The suitability of the method was tested by determining the recovery (95-102% as aglycons and 69-104% from glycosides) for each anthocyanidin. Method repeatability was tested by charting the total aglycon content of two samples over a period of 14 analyses and determining the coefficients of variation (1.41% for bilberry and 2.56% for in-house reference material). The method developed proved thus to be effective for reliable determination of anthocyanidins from freeze-dried berry samples and red wine. The total anthocyanidin content of the tested samples was as follows: in-house reference material, 447 +/- 8 mg/100 g; strawberry, 23.8 +/- 0.4 mg/100 g; black currant, 135 +/- 3 mg/100 g; bilberry, 360 +/- 3 mg/100 g; and Cabernet sauvignon red wine, 26.1 +/- 0.1 mg/100 mL.","859.0"

"Phenolic acids, flavonoids, vitamin C and antioxidant capacity of strawberry juices processed by high-intensity pulsed electric fields or heat treatments","","The effect of high-intensity pulsed electric fields (HIPEF) processing (35 kV/cm for 1,700 μs in bipolar 4-μs pulses at 100 Hz) on individual phenolic compounds (phenolic acids and flavonoids), vitamin C and antioxidant capacity of strawberry juice was evaluated and compared to heat (90 °C for 60 or 30 s) and fresh juice as a reference. Although strawberry juice underwent a substantial depletion of health-related compounds with storage time irrespective of the treatment conducted, ellagic acid was enhanced. HIPEF-treated strawberry juice maintained higher amounts of phenolic acids (ellagic and p-coumaric acid) and total anthocyanins than the thermally treated juices during the storage period. Regarding the antioxidant capacity, similar DPPH and ABTS values were obtained so that differences among pasteurized juices were non significant.

Eleven healthy volunteers consumed 200 ml of cranberry juice containing 650.8 microg total anthocyanins. Urine samples were collected within 24 h before and after consumption. Six of 12 anthocyanins identified in cranberry were quantified in human urine by HPLC coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS-MS). Among these, peonidin 3-O-galactoside, the second most plentiful anthocyanin in the juice, was found most abundantly in urine within 24 h, corresponding to 41.5 nmol (56.1% of total anthocyanins). The urinary levels of anthocyanins reached a maximum between 3 and 6 h after ingestion, and the recovery of total anthocyanins in the urine over 24 h was estimated to be 5.0% of the amount consumed.

"Antioxidants, low molecular weight carbohydrates, and total antioxidant capacity in strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa): effects of cultivar, ripening, and storage","15113146.0","Four cultivars of strawberries (Senga Sengana, BFr77111, Elsanta, and Honeoye) were studied for their content of antioxidants, total antioxidant capacity, and low molecular weight carbohydrates in relation to harvest year, ripening stage, and cold storage. For ascorbic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and total antioxidative capacity, measured in both water-soluble and water-insoluble extracts, there was a 2-5-fold variation among cultivars. Unripe berries contained lower concentrations of chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric acid and also quercetin and kaempferol compared with riper berries. During cold storage for up to 3 days, relatively few changes in the concentration of the different antioxidants occurred. The concentrations of several investigated parameters were interrelated, for example, for ascorbic acid and water-soluble antioxidant capacity and for ellagic acid and water-insoluble antioxidant capacity. The dominating sugars in strawberries were fructose and glucose, but considerable amounts of sucrose were also present, and their contents varied among cultivars, giving a predicted glycemic index of approximately 81. Verbascose, raffinose, and stachyose were found in only minor amounts. The study shows that the concentration of a number of bioactive compounds in strawberries varied according to cultivar, ripening stage, and storage.

"Chlorogenic acid, quercetin-3-rutinoside and black tea phenols are extensively metabolized in humans","12771321.0","Dietary phenols are antioxidants, and their consumption might contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Coffee and tea are major dietary sources of phenols. Dietary phenols are metabolized extensively in the body. Lack of quantitative data on their metabolites hinders a proper evaluation of the potential biological effects of dietary phenols in vivo. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the phenolic acid metabolites of chlorogenic acid (major phenol in coffee), quercetin-3-rutinoside (major flavonol in tea) and black tea phenols in humans, and determine the site of metabolism. Healthy humans (n = 20) with an intact colon participated in a dietary controlled crossover study, and we identified and quantified approximately 60 potential phenolic acid metabolites in urine. Half of the ingested chlorogenic acid and 43% of the tea phenols were metabolized to hippuric acid. Quercetin-3-rutinoside was metabolized mainly to phenylacetic acids, i.e., 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (36%), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (8%) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (5%). In contrast, in seven humans without a colon, we found only traces of phenolic acid metabolites in urine after they had ingested chlorogenic acid and quercetin-3-rutinoside. This implies that the colonic microflora convert most of these dietary phenols into metabolites that then reach the circulation. Metabolites of dietary phenols have lower antioxidant activity than their parent compounds; therefore, the contribution of dietary phenols to antioxidant activity in vivo might be lower than expected from in vitro tests.","867.0"

At 9 h under active oxygen method (AOM) conditions, peroxide value (PV) determinations showed that oil with the bran extract had a PV of 38.0 Mequiv/kg while the control oil had a PV of 129.0 Mequiv/kg. Extracts from the bran fractions of six durum wheat varieties had similar antioxidant activities in soy oil (PV 37.6-42.0 Mequiv/kg). However, Tenox butylated hydroxyanisole-butylated hydroxytoluene (BHA-BHT) mixture and Rosemary-AR were significantly stronger antioxidants (P < 0.005) than the extract from durum wheat bran at all the levels studied. High-performance liquid chromatographic and thin-layer chromatographic analyses of the durum wheat bran extract revealed the presence of protocatechuic, p-hydroxybenzoic, gentisic, caffeic, vanillic, chlorogenic, syringic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids. Among the identified free phenolics, ferulic, vanillic, and p-coumaric acids were present in the highest amounts.

"Detection of the addition of Citrus reticulata and hybrids to Citrus sinensis by flavonoïdes","","In some European countries there is a legal barrier against the marketing of some citrus juice mixtures under the denomination ""orange juice"", as allowed under certain conditions by the FDA for pasteurized and canned orange juice and for frozen concentrated orange juice. For this reason methods have to be developed to determine a juice addition of up to 10% Citrus reticulata and hybrids thereof and up to 5% Citrus aurantium. Using HPLC equipped with a photodiode array (PDA) detector we could establish that a combination of the flavanone glycoside (FG) and polymethoxylated flavone (PMF) pattern offers possibilities. For the flavanone glycosides the method is based on the presence of some specific compounds, on the didymin content, on a divergent ratio of hesperidin on narirutin, and/or on an unidentified component. In other cases, however, an F test applied on the relative PMF pattern offers a better solution calculating the % adulteration probability. We could conclude that, for all examined citrus samples added to Citrus sinensis, it is possible to detect the addition of 10% C. reticulata and hybrids thereof and of 5% C. aurantium.","870.0"
"Phenolic-Acids in Flaxseed","","Ninety-six samples of flaxseed from eight cultivars grown at four locations in western Canada for three years were used to study the effect of cultivar, location, and growing season on the phenolic acid contents of the seed. Flaxseed contained 8-10 g/kg of total phenolic acids, about 5 g/kg of esterified phenolic acids, and 3-5 g/kg of etherified phenolic acids. The esterified phenolic acids represented 48-66% of the total phenolic acids and were not dependent on cultivar. Variation in phenolic acids was mainly due to seasonal effect. While growing location had significant effects on phenolic acid contents of individual cultivars, no overall significant location effect was observed. The yellow-seeded flaxseed cultivar Linola 947 had lower levels of total and esterified phenolic acids compared to the traditional brown-seeded type. Phenolic acid contents of flaxseed were independent of protein and oil contents. A strong positive correlation was found between the constitutive concentrations of total and etherified phenolic acids in flaxseed and resistance to fusarium wilt.","871.0"
"Flavonoids and antioxidative activities in buckwheat","","Samples of buckwheat from four cultivars grown at three locations in western Canada For 4 years were used to study the effect of cultivar, location, and growing season on the flavonoid content and antioxidative activities of the seed.

"Effects of cultivar and environment on phenolic acids in buckwheat","","This systematic review analyzes emerging inducers that optimize the germination process of cereals and pseudocereals to enhance bioactive compound production, categorizing them as physical (UV-B radiation, electromagnetic fields, ultrasound, cold plasma), chemical (phytohormones, minerals, growth regulators), and biological (concurrent fermentation, microbial extracts). The results reveal that these inducers significantly increase specific metabolites such as GABA enrichment (up to 800%), phenolic compounds (50-450%), and carotenoids (30-120%) in various bioactive cereals and functional pseudocereals. The underlying mechanisms include enzymatic activation, signal transduction, and controlled stress responses, which improve the bioavailability of phenolics and other bioactive compounds. Critical technological considerations for industrial implementation, bioavailability, and biological efficacy of these compounds are addressed. Synergies between inducers demonstrate exceptional potential for developing ingredients with optimized bioactive properties, especially when combining physical and biological processes. This integrated approach represents a promising frontier in food technology for producing cereals and pseudocereals with enhanced nutritional and functional profiles, applicable in chronic disease prevention and functional food formulation.","873.0"
"Flavonoid content of flaxseed. Influence of cultivar and environment","","Flax (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i> L.) is a plant of high economic and practical importance valued for its fiber and oil, which have diverse applications in industries such as textiles, food, pharmaceuticals, and construction. Fungal pathogens of the genus <i>Fusarium</i>, however, pose one of the most serious threats to flax cultivation. They are responsible for a number of disease manifestations, notably <i>Fusarium</i> wilt and root rot. In the case of fusariosis, there is a lack of plant protection products, and often the only effective approach is to use resistant flax cultivars or to discontinue cultivation for several years. Currently, much attention is paid to biological methods of plant protection, which do not exert a negative influence on the environment or human health and are important for sustainable agriculture. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of the non-pathogenic endophytic fungal strain <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> Fo47 in protecting plants against pathogenic fungi. The results showed that pretreatment of flax plants with Fo47 increased resistance of plants to all tested fungi (<i>F. oxysporum</i>, <i>Fusarium culmorum</i>, <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>). Fo47 was the most effective for protection against <i>F. culmorum</i> for the Jan flax cultivar and <i>R. solani</i> for the Bukoz cultivar. Pretreatment with Fo47 of flax plants inoculated with <i>F. culmorum</i> caused an increase in the level of secondary metabolites involved in plant resistance (phenolics) and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b) compared to plants treated only with the pathogenic fungal strain. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed structural changes in the polymers of cell walls. The highest intensities of vibrations characteristic of lignin and pectin were observed for flax treated with Fo47 and infected with <i>F. culmorum</i>, suggesting the highest level of these polymers, higher than in plants treated only with pathogenic fungi. Thus, it can be concluded that application of the non-pathogenic strain strengthened the immune response of flax plants. These results highlight the strong potential of the non-pathogenic strain as a biological control agent, especially for <i>Fusarium</i> infection in flax.","874.0"
"Phenolics and antioxidative activities in common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L)","","Six bean cultivars grown in southern Manitoba for 2 years were evaluated for variability in yield of millstreams and phenolic constituents. The ethanolic extract of bean cultivars and millstreams was screened for antioxidant activity using the beta-carotene-linoleate and the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) in vitro model systems. Cultivar was the main source of variation for yield of millstreams, content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities. Phenolic compounds in cultivars varied from 3.3 to 16.6 mg catechin equivalent and from 0.15 to 0.32 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside equivalent g(-1) bean for total phenolic and anthocyanin contents, respectively. The bean cultivars exhibited antioxidant activity (AA) of 10-46% inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the linoleate and 0.4-1.3 trolox equivalent antioxidant capacities (TEAC) in the DPPH model systems. The hull millstream with maximum concentration of phenolic compounds exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity of 383 micromolar trolox equivalent g(-1) hull. Total phenolic content, alone or in combination with other phenolic constituents, is a potential candidate as a selection criterion for antioxidant activity in beans.","875.0"
"Effect of cooking on the capsaicinoids and phenolics contents of Mexican peppers","","Raw and cooked (boiled and grilled) Poblano, Bell, Chilaca, Caribe, Jalapeño, Serrano, Habanero, and Manzano peppers were evaluated for tristimulus colour, capsaicinoids (capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapscapsaicin), and total phenolic contents. Boiling (96°C) and grilling (210°C) was performed under household conditions according to typical procedures of the Mexican cuisine. Contents of capsaicin (0.6-913.8μg/g), dihydrocapsaicin (0-756.9μg/g), nordihydrocapsaicin (0-68.2μg/g), and total phenolics (1150.5-2190.0μg of gallic acid equivalents/g) in raw peppers varied widely between types of peppers. Moderate losses (1.1-28.1%) in capsaicinoids were induced by boiling while grilling caused a significant increase (2.6-924.9%) in the content of these compounds. Proportion of individual capsaicinoids was similar in raw and cooked peppers. Boiling and grilling sequentially increased (7.4-137.0%) the total phenolic content in pungent peppers. Total phenolic content in non-pungent Bell peppers was reduced by cooking (1.6-26.9%). Boiling induced smaller changes in colour values (L*, a*, and b*) compared to grilling. The results demonstrated that Mexican raw peppers are rich in capsaicinoids and phenolic compounds. Household cooking can cause either decreases or increases in the content of such compounds in peppers.","876.0"
"The antioxidative substances in cacao liquor","9675711.0","The antioxidative substances contained in cacao liquor, which is one of the major ingredients of chocolate, were separated by column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. Three major compounds were purified and two of them were identified by 1H, 13C NMR and mass spectra as (-)-epicatechin (EC) and (+)-catechin (CA). Their antioxidative activity was measured by monitoring the peroxide value of linoleic acid and the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance values of erythrocyte ghost membranes and microsomes. EC and CA had strong antioxidative effects in all three methods, but one unidentified peak was found to be less effective. Additionally, we analyzed the polyphenol concentration of cacao liquor extractions produced in several countries. The total polyphenol concentration was 7.0 to 13.0%, catechin concentration was 0.31 to 0.49%, and epicatechin concentration was 0.35 to 1.68% in the extractions. It is believed that chocolate is stable against oxidative deterioration on account of the presence of these polyphenolic compounds, and it is also expected to have a protective role against lipid peroxidation in living systems.","877.0"
"Effects of storage conditions on furocoumarin levels in intact, chopped, or homogenized parsnips","11958623.0","Furocoumarins represent a family of natural food constituents with phototoxic and photomutagenic properties. They are found mainly in plants belonging to the Rutaceae and Umbilliferae such as celery, carrots, and parsnips. Parsnips (Pastinaca sativa L.) have become more and more popular as a vegetable, e.g., as a constituent of or ingredient in baby food. Previous work has shown that microbial infection of parsnip roots can result in a dramatic increase in furocoumarin levels. In this study, freshly harvested parsnips were stored as whole roots, pieces (cubes), or homogenate at +4 degrees C or -18 degrees C over various time periods under standard conditions. It was found that furocoumarin concentrations (sum of five furocoumarins: angelicin, isopimpinellin, 5-methoxypsoralen, 8-methoxypsoralen, and psoralen) in freshly harvested parsnips, analyzed by HPLC after extraction with diethyl ether and sequential solid phase (reversed-phase and silica) extraction, was generally lower than 2.5 mg/kg, and storage of parsnips in any form investigated at -18 degrees C over up to 50 days did not lead to a marked increase in furocoumarin levels. In contrast, storage of whole parsnips, but not of cubes or homogenate, at +4 degrees C resulted in a marked biphasic increase of furocoumarin concentrations after 7 and 38 days of storage up to levels of about 40 mg/kg. A dramatic increase in furocoumarin concentrations up to 566 mg/kg was observed when whole parsnips obtained from the market were kept at room temperature over 53 days, resulting in a visible microbial (mold) infection. Baby food products from the German market containing parsnips as an ingredient or constituent showed furocoumarin levels < or =0.41 mg/kg, suggesting that properly stored roots/preparations have been used. It is recommended that, after harvesting, parsnips be kept at -18 degrees C or under other conditions that prevent microbial infections.","878.0"
"Influence of apple puree preparation and storage on polyphenol contents and antioxidant activity","","The polyphenolic components of Idared and Shampion apple purées were determined by HPLC; chlorogenic acid was the most abundant acid (20.0 mg/100 g in microwaved Idared); other polyphenols identified in high concentrations included (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin B1 and B2; quercetin and cyanidin glycosides were found in minor concentrations. The Shampion purées had higher total phenolics (142 mg/100 g) and procyanidin B2 concentrations (17.3 mg/100 g) than the Idared ones, and polymeric procyanidins represented 41% of all polyphenols. Antioxidant capacities of the samples, determined by spectrophotometric methods and EPR spectroscopy, correlated well with the concentration of polyphenols. The antioxidant properties could be better represented by EPR than by UV-vis measurements. The latter require transparent (clear) samples whereas EPR can be a method of choice in the assessment of radical-scavenging activity of dense and cloudy apple purées. Our results support the putative high antioxidant value of apple purées and define their capacity in terms of the major constituents. Apple purées are a rich source of natural antioxidants, especially of chlorogenic acid and procyanidins.","879.0"
"Isolation and HPLC determination of phenolic compounds in red grapes","","Resveratrol is the most important biopotential phytoalexin of the stilbene group (natural polyphenolic secondary metabolites), synthesized naturally by the action of biotic and abiotic factors on the plant. The yield of individual bioactive compounds isolated from grapevine components, products and by-products is directly dependent on the conditions of the synthesis, extraction and identification techniques used. Modern methods of synthesis and extraction, as well as identification techniques, are centred on the use of non-toxic solvents that have the advantages of the realisation of rapid extractions, maintenance of optimal parameters, and low energy consumption; this is a challenge with promising results for various industrial applications. Actionable advances in identifying and analysing stilbenes consist of techniques for coupling synthesis/extraction/identification methods that have proven accurate, reproducible and efficient. The main challenge remains to keep resveratrol compositionally unaltered while increasing its microbiome solubility and stability as a nutraceutical in the food industry.","880.0"
"Chemical composition and physical characteristics of proanthocyanidin-free and normal barley isotypes","","Proanthocyanidin-free mutant (ant) and parent (normal) barley pairs were grown at the Montana Agricultural Experiment Station, Bozeman, Montana, U.S.A., in 1985 and 1986. The pairs included: Triumph, ant17-148 (cv. Gallant); Moravian III, ant13-605; Andre, ant13-587; Robust, ant17-625; Advance, ant17-537, normal and ant-, respectively. The ant barleys contained more (P < 0.04) protein than the normal barleys (14.5 vs. 14.1%, respectively), and the 1985 crop had a higher (P < 0.04) protein level than the 1986 crop (14.6 vs. 14.0%, respectively). The starch and mineral contents were similar for all barleys. The fiber contents were similar for type and crop year, but variation (P < 0.04) existed among pairs. Differences (P < 0.04) appeared in ether extract and viscosity values with barley type, crop year and among pairs. The total beta-glucan contents were similar within barley pairs, but total beta-glucan contents among pairs differed (P < 0.02), and the 1986 barleys contained more (P < 0.002) total beta-glucans than the 1985 crop. Normal barleys contained more (P < 0.0001) proanthocyanidins and total phenols than the ant barleys, but tannin contents did not differ between barley types or among pairs. Physical measurements were similar between barley pairs, but the normal barleys had heavier (P < 0.05) 1000-kernel weights than the ant barleys and the 1985 crop had heavier (P < 0.002) test weights than the 1986 crop. The proanthocyanidin-free trait had relatively little impact on most other chemical and physical traits of barley. The data presented in this study suggest that, if the ant gene becomes a desirable genetic trait in barley, the chemical components will not be altered so as to reduce the value of the grain for feed significantly.","881.0"
"Phenolic compounds and squalene in olive oils: the concentration and antioxidant potential of total phenols, simple phenols, secoiridoids, lignans and squalene","10908812.0","The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic antioxidant and squalene content in a range of olive and seed oils. A mean of 290 +/- 38 (SEM) mg squalene/100 g was detected. However, while there was a weak significant difference between extra virgin (424 +/- 21 mg/kg) and refined virgin (340 +/- 31 mg/100 g; P<0.05) olive oils, highly significant differences were evident between extra virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) refined virgin olive oils (P<0.0001) and seed oils (24 +/- 5 mg/100 g). While seed oils were devoid, on average, the olive oils contained 196 +/- 19 mg/kg total phenolics as judged by HPLC analysis, but the value for extra virgin (232 +/- 15 mg/kg) was significantly higher than that of refined virgin olive oil (62 +/- 12 mg/kg; P<0.0001). Appreciable quantities of simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol) were detected in olive oils, with significant differences between extravirgin (41.87 +/- 6.17) and refined virgin olive oils (4.72 +/- 215; P<0.01). The major linked phenols were secoiridoids and lignans. Although extra virgin contained higher concentrations of secoiridoids (27.72 +/- 6.84) than refined olive oils (9.30 +/- 3.81) this difference was not significant. On the other hand, the concentration of lignans was significantly higher (P<0.001) in extra virgin (41.53 +/- 3.93) compared to refined virgin olive oils (7.29 +/- 2.56). All classes of phenolics were shown to be potent antioxidants. In future epidemiologic studies, both the nature and source of olive oil consumed should be differentiated in ascertaining cancer risk.","882.0"
"Isolation, structure elucidation and antioxidant potential of the major phenolic and flavonoid compounds in brined olive drupes","12659724.0","Because olives represent an important component of the Mediterranean diet, it is necessary to establish unequivocal identification and quantitation of the major potential antioxidant phenolic compounds they contain. The major phenolic antioxidants in two types of brined olives were isolated and purified by semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography. Structural analysis was conducted using UV spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In particular, completely assigned 1H and 13C NMR data are presented and errors in literature data are corrected. The data show that tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, 3-(3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid (dihydrocaffeic acid), dihydro-p-coumaric acid (phloretic acid), the phenylpropanoid glucosides acteoside (verbascoside) and isoacteoside, along with the flavonoids luteolin and apigenin are major components of the phenolic fraction of brined black olives. Brined green olives contain only hydroxytyrosol and traces of other minor phenolics. Brined olives contain even higher concentrations of phenolic antioxidants than olive oil and may, therefore, be more important modulators of cancer chemopreventive activity.","883.0"

The plasma samples were acidified with 1M hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) of two-fold volume for three times. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a Zorbax SB-C18 column with a linear gradient whereas 0.1% acetic acid/water/acetonitrile was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in both negative and positive modes. More than 20 components including 16 components from 'Shuangdan' granule and 5 metabolites were simultaneously identified by comparing their mass spectra and retention behavior with reference compounds or literature data.

"Antioxidant capacity and phenolic content of spinach as affected by genetics and maturation","16248562.0","Spinach leaves harvested at three maturity stages from eight commercial cultivars (CC) and eight advanced breeding lines (ABL) were evaluated for oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), total phenolics, and flavonoid composition and content. ABL had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and ORAC than CC. Midmaturity spinach leaves had higher levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity than immature and mature leaves. The contents of individual flavonoids varied in response to maturation, with the predominant glucuronated flavones decreasing and patuletin and spinacetin derivatives increasing. Both total phenolics and total flavonoids correlated well with ORAC (r(xy)() = 0.78 and 0.81, respectively) demonstrating that flavonoids were major contributors to antioxidant capacity. Our results indicate that spinach genotypes should be harvested at the midmaturity stage for consumers to benefit from elevated levels of health promoting flavonoids present in the leaves. Additionally, plant breeders can select for increased phenolic content to increase antioxidant capacity of spinach genotypes.","887.0"
"Effects of Genetic, Pre- and Post-Harvest Factors on Phenolic Content and Antioxidant Capacity of White Asparagus Spears","20054475.0","The effects of genetic, pre-harvest (season of harvest, spear diameter, spear portion and spear tip color) and post-harvest factors (storage and domestic preparation practices, e.g., peeling and cooking) on total phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbic acid content of white asparagus spears and their correlation with antioxidant capacity (DPPH and FRAP) were studied. Results showed that genetic material was important for the total phenolic content but not season of harvest, spear diameter or storage. Violet spear tips and apical spear portions showed the largest amount of total phenolics. Peeling did not affect total phenolics in fresh asparagus, whereas it reduced their content in stored asparagus, while cooking resulted in an increase in both fresh and stored asparagus. However, the soluble extract of total phenolics and flavonoids were minor and the missing significance of phenolics and flavonoids in antioxidant capacity of white asparagus spears depends on these small amounts.","888.0"

"Quantitative analysis of flavan-3-ols in Spanish foodstuffs and beverages","11087482.0","An HPLC method, using detection after postcolumn derivatization with p-dimethylaminocynnamaldehyde (DMACA), was developed for the quantitative analysis of individual flavanols in food. This method was applied to flavanol determination in 56 different kinds of Spanish food products, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, beverages (cider, coffee, beer, tea, and wine), and chocolate. The determined compounds corresponded to the catechins and proanthocyanidin dimers and trimers usually present in food and, therefore, they were representative of the flavanols of low degree of polymerization consumed with the diet. The data generated could be used for calculation of the dietary intake of either individual or total flavanols, which would allow the further establishment of epidemiological correlations with the incidence of chronic diseases. Similar flavanol profiles were found in the different samples of a similar type of product, even though important variations could exist in the concentrations of total and individual flavanols among them. This was attributed to factors such as sample origin, stage of ripeness, post-harvesting conservation, and processing. Total flavanol contents varied from nondetectable in most of the vegetables to 184 mg/100 g found in a sample of broad bean. Substantial amounts were also found in some fruits, such as plum and apple, as well as in tea and red wine. Epicatechin was the most abundant flavanol, followed by catechin and procyanidin B2. In general, catechins were found in all the flavanol-containing products, but the presence of gallocatechins was only relevant in pomegranate, broad bean, lentil, grape, wine, beer, and tea, and most of the berries. Galloyled flavanols were only detected in strawberry, medlar, grape, and tea.","891.0"
"TLC densitometric method for the quantification of eugenol and gallic acid in clove","","Gallic acid (GA), a phenolic acid found in fruits and vegetables, has been consumed by humans for centuries. Its extensive health benefits, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties, have been well-documented. GA's potent antioxidant capabilities enable it to neutralize free radicals, reduce oxidative stress, and protect cells from damage. Additionally, GA exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines and enzymes, making it a potential therapeutic agent for inflammatory diseases. It also demonstrates anticancer properties by inhibiting cancer cell growth and promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, GA offers cardiovascular benefits, such as lowering blood pressure, decreasing cholesterol, and enhancing endothelial function, which may aid in the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases. This review covers the chemical structure, sources, identification and quantification methods, and biological and therapeutic properties of GA, along with its applications in food. As research progresses, the future for GA appears promising, with potential uses in functional foods, pharmaceuticals, and nutraceuticals aimed at improving overall health and preventing disease. However, ongoing research and innovation are necessary to fully understand its functional benefits, address current challenges, and establish GA as a mainstay in therapeutic and nutritional interventions.","892.0"
"Variation in the quercetin content in different colored onions (Allium cepa L.)","","Red onion skins, typically discarded as waste, are a rich source of anthocyanins-bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties but low stability. This study developed a yogurt dressing enriched with microencapsulated red onion (Allium cepa L.) skin extract to enhance anthocyanin stability and bioavailability. Microencapsulation using biopolymer blends improved protection, with powder G1 (higher in polysaccharides than G2) showing greater encapsulation efficiency (87.18 ± 0.92%) and storage stability. In vitro results confirmed that increased carbohydrate concentration offers better anthocyanin protection.The resulting stable powder was incorporated into yogurt dressing at 1% and 3% concentrations. These formulations were evaluated for physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, and sensory quality. The addition of the microencapsulated extract increased antioxidant activity (15.64-23.05 µmol TE/g dw) and protein content (7.74-7.82 g/100 g), while also acting as a natural colorant. Higher powder concentrations improved texture and rheological properties, contributing to better structural integrity and compaction with higher powder concentrations.

"Impact of high pressure processing on total antioxidant activity, phenolic, ascorbic acid, anthocyanin content and colour of strawberry and blackberry purées","","The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of high pressure treatments and conventional thermal processing on antioxidant activity, levels of key antioxidant groups (polyphenols, ascorbic acid and anthocyanins) and the colour of strawberry and blackberry purées. Bioactive compounds (cyanidin-3-glycoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, ascorbic acid) and antioxidant activity were measured in strawberry and blackberry purées subjected to high pressure treatment (400, 500, 600 MPa/15 min/10-30 °C) and thermal treatments (70 °C/2 min). Samples were assessed immediately after processing. Different pressure treatments did not cause any significant change in ascorbic acid (p >0.05). In contrast, following thermal processing (P₇₀ >=2 min) ascorbic acid degradation was 21% (p <0.05) as compared to unprocessed purée. However, no significant changes in anthocyanins were observed between pressure treated and unprocessed purées (p >0.05), whereas conventional thermal treatments significantly reduced the levels (p <0.05). In general, antioxidant activities of pressure treated strawberry and blackberry purées were significantly higher (p <0.05) than in thermally processed samples. Colour changes were minor (ΔE) for pressurised purées but the differences were slightly higher for thermally treated samples. Redness of purées was well retained in high pressure treated samples. Therefore processing strawberry and blackberry by high pressure processing could be an efficient method to preserve these products quality. Hence high pressure processing (HPP) at moderate temperatures may be appropriate to produce nutritious and fresh like purées. Industrial relevance: This research paper provides scientific evidence of the potential benefits of high pressure processing in comparison to thermal treatments in retaining important bioactive compounds. Antioxidant activity (ARP), ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins after exposure to high pressure treatments (400-600 MPa) were well retained. Our results also show that redness and colour intensity of strawberry and blackberry purées were better preserved by high pressure processing than conventional thermal treatment. From a nutritional perspective, high pressure processing is an attractive food preservation technology and offers opportunities for horticultural and food processing industries to meet the growing demand from consumers for healthier food products. Therefore high pressure processed foods could be sold at a premium than their thermally processed counterparts as they will have retained their fresh-like properties.","896.0"
"Determination of phenolic compounds of biological interest in some Italian red wines by HPLC-DAD","","Sparkling wine is a complex alcoholic beverage with high economic value, produced through a secondary fermentation of a still wine, followed by a prolonged aging period that may last from nine months to several years. With the growing global demand for high-quality sparkling wines, understanding the biochemical mechanisms related to aroma development has become increasingly relevant. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the secondary fermentation process, with particular emphasis on yeast selection, types of closure, and the impact of aging on the volatile composition. Special attention is also given to the analytical strategies employed for the identification and quantification of target compounds in sparkling wine matrices. Due to the presence of volatile compounds at trace levels, effective extraction and pre-concentration techniques are essential. Extraction methods such as solid-phase microextraction (SPME), stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), and thin-film SPME (TF-SPME) are discussed, as well as chromatographic techniques, such as gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC).","897.0"
"Food Yields Summarized by Different Stages of Preparation","","Iron nanoparticles (Fe-NPs) have emerged as promising additives for enhancing biogas production through anaerobic digestion (AD). This review comprehensively examines Fe-NP synthesis methods (chemical, physical, and biological), their applications in biogas systems, and their effects on microbial communities. Analysis of recent studies reveals that Fe-NPs can increase methane production by 0.166 to 7 times compared to controls, with optimal concentrations varying from 5.5 to 4330 mg/L depending on nanoparticle type and substrate. Zero-valent iron nanoparticles (nZVI) at 20 mg/L achieved 1.96-fold enhancement, while Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles showed consistent improvements of 0.3-2.6 times across multiple studies. Modified Fe-NPs demonstrated a superior performance: Fe-NPs coated with magnesium hydroxide (Fe-NPs-MG) increased methane yield by 1.2 times in semicontinuous systems, Fe-NPs-U showed 1.45-1.52 times improvement, and Fe-NPs-Ze achieved 0.88 times enhancement. The highest increase (7-fold) was observed with Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-NPs using a coal substrate. Fe-NPs enhance biogas production through multiple mechanisms: facilitating direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), promoting the growth of syntrophic bacteria (e.g., Syntrophomonas) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (e.g., Methanospirillum), reducing H<sub>2</sub>S inhibition, and improving substrate bioavailability. Despite promising laboratory results, industrial-scale application remains limited.

Subjective (sensory evaluation) and objective assessment (colorimeter and <i>E</i>-tongue) were conducted to provide a deeper insight into the differences between LAGP made from summer and autumn leaves and spring leaves. A total of 52 key differential metabolites were screened by metabolomics. Catechins and flavonoids, especially flavonol glycosides, exhibited significant seasonal variation. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that flavonoid biosynthesis was the key factor that caused the quality changes of LAGP tea in different seasons. Additionally, preliminary explorations revealed that appropriate addition of odorants, especially hexanal (12.0-14.4 μg/L) and (<i>Z</i>)-3-hexen-1-ol (4.88-5.85 μg/L), could effectively mask the bitterness of EGCG and improve sensory acceptability. These findings provide theoretical insights into the seasonal effects of LAGP tea and guide the optimization of optimization of summer-autumn tea production.","901.0"
"Polyphenol content and total antioxidant activity of vini novelli (young red wines)","10725141.0","Eight commercial Italian vini novelli (red wines prepared by carbonic maceration and supposed to be consumed within three months from their wine-making) were evaluated for their total antioxidant activity. The wines had an average total phenol content (1605.4 +/- 337.4 mg/L gallic acid equivalents) lower than that of wines prepared by traditional maceration and consumable after aging (2057. 3 +/- 524.0 mg/L gallic acid equivalents). The average flavanol content (424.7 +/- 121.3 mg/L catechin equivalents) and the total antioxidant activity (16.8 +/- 3.8 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) of vini novelli were higher than the corresponding values (382.7 +/- 174.5 mg/L catechin equivalents and 12.3 +/- 3.3 mmol/L Trolox equivalents) found for aged wines. Three couples of experimental wines were prepared from the same grapes by traditional or carbonic maceration. These wines showed a different phenolic pattern, anthocyanins being more abundant in vini novelli. However, the average total antioxidant activities of the wines were similar, suggesting that aging (and not the wine-making technique) is the main factor influencing the antioxidant activity of red wines.","902.0"

The method incorporates isotope dilution to ensure correct accuracy and precision, introducing the utilization of individual stable 13C3-labeled lignans. To demonstrate the potential of this new method, preliminary results of the levels of dietary lignans in selected foods are presented. It is concluded that the method fulfils the reliability criteria and can be applied to the analysis of the most common lignans in human food, being an essential asset to establish the intake of lignans in a determined population and their relation with disease prevention.","904.0"
"Lignan content of selected foods from Japan","18163563.0","Lignans constitute a group of phytochemicals widely distributed in the human diet. Once ingested, most dietary lignans are metabolized by the gut microflora to enterolactone and enterodiol, also known as enterolignans. Together with isoflavones and coumestrol, enterolignans have been traditionally classified as phytoestrogens, plant-derived compounds that exhibit estrogen-like activity. In addition to a higher intake of vegetables, many studies have suggested that the presence of phytoestrogens in the Japanese diet is one of the factors that might explain the reduced incidence of certain chronic diseases in Japanese populations compared with Western countries. Being a vegetable-based diet, exposure to dietary lignans should be high, but to assess this exposure, a lignan food database is required. Stable isotope-dilution gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry was used to quantify six plant lignans in 86 food items commonly consumed in Japan. These data will complement the previous databases and most importantly expand the knowledge of occurrence of lignans in food to Eastern diets.","905.0"
"Influence of storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation in potato tubers (Solanum tuburosum L.)","10888571.0","The influence of 2 weeks and 3 months of dark storage upon light-induced chlorogenic acid accumulation within tuber tissue of four potato cultivars and upon 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid concentrations within cv. King Edward was determined. Storage period significantly affected (P < 0.05) the magnitude of the light-induced chlorogenic acid response with accumulation rates 3-4 times higher in tubers exposed to light after 2 weeks compared with those placed under light after 3 months. Comparison of chlorogenic acid concentrations in controls after 2 and 3 months of dark storage indicated that tuber chlorogenic concentrations decline during prolonged cold store at 5 degrees C. Rates of accumulation in response to light were cultivar-dependent with cv. Fianna the most light-sensitive and cv. Maris Piper relatively light-insensitive. In virtually all cases exposure to sodium and fluorescent light promoted higher rates of accumulation than did exposure to high-pressure mercury light sources. Chlorogenic acid values steadily increased over 15 days of illumination with, in the majority of cases, no indication of cessation. Light exposure increased 5-, 4-, and 3-caffeoylquinic acid accumulation rates in cv. King Edward. Irrespective of storage period and light source, ratios of 5-:4-:3-caffeoylquinic acid were ca. 85:15:0 at day 0 and 52:42:6 by day 15.","906.0"

The analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and seven compounds were identified and quantified: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, 5-O-caffeoilquinic acid, verbascoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, and luteolin. The antioxidant activity was assessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals, and the beta-carotene linoleate model system. The antioxidant activity was correlated with the amount of phenolics found in each sample. The antimicrobial activity was screened using Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans).

"Changes in bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity during homogenization and thermal processing of tomato puree","","The effect of homogenization and thermal processing on a number of bioactive compounds (carotenoids, total phenolics, ascorbic acid and folates) in both raw tomato puree (RTP) and “hot break” tomato puree (HTP) was investigated. RTP and HTP were homogenized in either one or two-steps, followed by pasteurization at 98 °C for 40 s. Additionally, HTP was pasteurized in parallel at 98 °C, 108 °C and 128 °C. In general, homogenization had no effect, but changes were observed after pasteurization (98 °C for 40 s). Carotenoids were relatively resistant to thermal degradation, whereas total phenolic content and ascorbic acid significantly decreased. However, a higher content of folates was determined in the homogenized and pasteurized samples due to their higher extraction from the subcellular compartment. The increase in pasteurization temperatures of the HTP up to 128 °C led to a decrease of ascorbic acid, total phenolic compounds and folates. In conclusion, homogenization and pasteurization at 98 °C for 40 s improves the nutritional value of tomato puree, increasing the extractability of the folates and maintaining the carotenoid content. Industrial relevance: Unlike other vegetables, the tomato is a staple food that is not frequently homogenized by the processing industry, although homogenization could improve product quality. This is why we explored this technique, using one-step and two-step homogenization. The tomato and vegetable processing industry frequently pasteurizes at a constant flow rate, meaning constant heating time. In this study, we employed three different temperatures, using the same time of exposure, to cover different situations in the food industry. Depending on the product's thickness, an increase in the temperature might be needed to reduce any microbiological hazard in the final product. Homogenization followed by pasteurization at 98 °C for 40 s resulted in a greater improvement of the nutritional value of tomato puree in all situations tested.","908.0"
"Changes in antioxidant flavonoids during freeze-drying of red onions and subsequent storage","","Red onion skins, typically discarded as waste, are a rich source of anthocyanins-bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties but low stability. This study developed a yogurt dressing enriched with microencapsulated red onion (Allium cepa L.) skin extract to enhance anthocyanin stability and bioavailability. Microencapsulation using biopolymer blends improved protection, with powder G1 (higher in polysaccharides than G2) showing greater encapsulation efficiency (87.18 ± 0.92%) and storage stability. In vitro results confirmed that increased carbohydrate concentration offers better anthocyanin protection.The resulting stable powder was incorporated into yogurt dressing at 1% and 3% concentrations. These formulations were evaluated for physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, and sensory quality. The addition of the microencapsulated extract increased antioxidant activity (15.64-23.05 µmol TE/g dw) and protein content (7.74-7.82 g/100 g), while also acting as a natural colorant. Higher powder concentrations improved texture and rheological properties, contributing to better structural integrity and compaction with higher powder concentrations. Sensory evaluation indicated favorable consumer acceptance.This study demonstrates that microencapsulation effectively preserves anthocyanin bioactivity and enhances the functional and visual properties of yogurt dressing. The approach offers a sustainable solution for utilizing red onion skin by-products in functional food development.","909.0"
"Flavonoids changes in fresh-cut onions during storage in different packaging systems","","Consumers demand healthy, natural and fresh foods, which require only a minimum amount of effort and time for preparation. This was the reason for comparing the effects of different mild preservation technologies on onion flavonoids. Onions were minimally processed to produce fresh-sliced onions, which were packed either in closed plastic cups or under vacuum conditions, taking into account the effect of light exposure. In all cases, the commodity was acceptable after the storage period, with the exception of vacuum packaging (score 5, fair/poor, on a 1â9 scale), due to water loss (about 4%) colour loss and a glassy appearance. In general, after storage in the dark, a slight increase in flavonols was observed, whereas a clear decrease in the relatively low amounts of anthocyanins was evident. However, the best performance was obtained when the more transparent polystyrene cups were stored under light. Both types of flavonoids increased, with an enhanced increase of total flavonols by 58%, and an increase in total anthocyanins of 39%.","910.0"
"Phenolic compounds in apples : varietal differences","","Pea protein is increasingly used as a plant-based alternative for fining white wines, aiming to reduce excessive polyphenols while replacing animal-derived or synthetic agents such as PVPP. This study compared pea protein alone (P), PVPP (PV), and untreated control wines (V0) with five combinations containing pea protein and additional agents, such as activated carbon (C), bentonite (B), yeast hulls (Y), and fungal chitosan (K), forming the variants PCB, PYB, PCY, PKY, and PKC applied in doses of 20 g/hL. Fining was applied to aromatic white wines of <i>Tămâioasa Românească</i> in triplicate (50 L tanks), obtained and followed by standard vinification steps. Main wine parameters (ethanol, malic acid, acetic acid, pH) were largely unaffected by the treatments, while free sugar levels showed only slight variations. Some significant differences were observed in total acidity. Total polyphenol content was significantly reduced by ternary fining combinations containing pea protein and yeast extract (PCY and PKY), as well as by PVPP, with reductions of approximately 37% compared to the control. Proanthocyanidins were largely preserved irrespective of the treatment, whereas flavan-3,4-diols were significantly reduced by PVPP. The fining treatments induced only small, imperceptible differences in colour, detectable solely through CIELab measurements, with the classical PVPP treatment producing wines with wines with the greenest colour tones. Volatile profiles, assessed using a GC analyser with two columns (Heracles electronic nose), were analysed in detail. Of all the 8 experimental variants, chitosan- and yeast hull-containing combinations (PKY and PCY) enhanced both varietal and fermentation-derived aromas, particularly terpenes and key esters, producing the most expressive and complex wines. In these variants, compared to control wines, eucalyptol, linalool, and <i>trans</i>-linalool oxide increased approximately by 13.1-23.2%, 16.7-19.3% and 341.5-428.7%, respectively. Pea protein alone preserved the aroma profile closest to the untreated control, inducing no significant differences in all the compound classes, making it a suitable alternative to PVPP. In contrast, bentonite-containing treatments reduced ester and terpene concentrations, simplifying the aroma profile and diminishing varietal characteristics. In bentonite variants, especially PCB, reduced key aroma compounds such as 2-phenylethyl acetate by 17.9%, ethyl octanoate by 12.9% and ethyl decanoate by 33.0%, linalool and <i>trans</i>-linalool oxide, by 18.5%, and 22.7%, respectively. These results support the use of pea protein as a selective and minimally disruptive fining agent, suitable for reducing polyphenol content while preserving wine quality. Pea protein combinations with yeast hulls, and to some extent with chitosan or other fining agents, can further enhance aroma complexity and varietal expression.","911.0"
"Literature data may underestimate the actual antioxidant capacity of cereals","15941353.0","Several recent articles have reported a significant antioxidant capacity of cereal products, determined in methanolic and ethanolic extracts. The aim of this work was to conduct an assessment of the antioxidant capacity of cereals using both chemical and in vitro digestive enzymatic extraction of antioxidants. Ferric reducing power (FRAP) and free radical scavenging capacity (DPPH) methods were used to determine the antioxidant capacity in wheat flour, bread, raw and boiled rice, wheat bran, and oat bran. The most efficient antioxidant extraction was achieved by using successively acidic methanol/water (50:50 v/v, pH 2) and acetone/water (70:30 v/v). The antioxidant capacity in these extracts ranged from 1.1 to 4.4 micromol Trolox/g dw. A significant amount of hydrolyzable phenolics with a high antioxidant capacity (from 5 to 108 micromol Trolox/g dw) was found in the residues of this aqueous-organic extraction. The antioxidant capacities of these nonextractable polyphenols are usually ignored in the literature, although they may have an antioxidant role in the gastrointestinal tract, especially after colonic fermentation, and may be fermentated to active metabolites. On the other hand, in vitro digestive enzymatic extracts obtained by enzymatic treatments that mimic conditions in the gastrointestinal tract showed that the amount of antioxidants released by the cereal matrix into the human intestine may be higher than the one that can be expected from measurements in the usual aqueous-organic extracts.","912.0"

"Antioxidants profile of small tomato fruits : effect of irrigation and industrial process","","This study investigates the impact of industrial wastewater from leather, household, and marble sources on the growth, physiological traits, and biochemical responses of Momordica charantia (bitter melon). Industrial activities often lead to the release of contaminated effluents, which can significantly affect plant health and agricultural productivity. Water analysis revealed that leather effluent contained high concentrations of heavy metals, including cadmium (2.67 mg/L), lead (1.95 mg/L), and nickel (1.02 mg/L), all of which exceeded the recommended safety limits for irrigation. Seed germination was significantly reduced, with only 45% germination in seeds irrigated with leather effluent, compared to 90% in the control group. Similarly, in plants treated with leather wastewater, shoot length, and root length were reduced by 38% and 42%. Chlorophyll content showed a marked decline, with chlorophyll ""a"" reduced by 25% and chlorophyll ""b"" by 30% in wastewater-treated plants, indicating impaired photosynthetic activity. Antioxidant enzyme activity, including catalase and superoxide dismutase, increased by up to 40%, reflecting a stress response to heavy metal toxicity. These findings highlight that industrial wastewater severely disrupts plant metabolic processes, leading to stunted growth and physiological stress. To safeguard crop productivity and food security, stringent wastewater treatment protocols must be implemented to mitigate environmental contamination. Future research should focus on developing advanced remediation techniques and sustainable wastewater management practices to reduce heavy metal toxicity and enhance soil health.","914.0"

"Evaluation of tissue dissociation of durum wheat grain (Triticum durum Desf.) generated by the milling process","","The three major botanical components (starchy endosperm, aleurone layer and pericarp) of eight durum wheat samples exhibited significantly different compositions and concentrations in phenolic acids. The starchy endosperm, the aleurone layer and the pericarp were respectively characterised by a low content in ferulic acid (FA), a high content intrans -sinapic acid (t -SA), and a high content in ferulic acid dehydrodimers (DHD). These three chemical markers can be exploited to differentiate the three grain botanical parts within milling fractions and to evaluate the milling efficiency, particularly the separation between bran and endosperm. The histological dissociation of the wheat grain generated by the milling process can be investigated further into details using the three phenolic acids markers. A separability index (S i) was proposed in order to quantify the ease of dissociation of endosperm from bran. Differences in S i values between wheat varieties grown under various agricultural conditions demonstrated the relevant variability of this character. The structural and molecular factors implied in the control of tissue dissociation are discussed in details.","917.0"

"Minimal processing of a Granny Smith apple purée by microwave heating","","Consumers are demanding more “fresh appearing”, more convenient and healthier fruit products. At the same time fruit industries look for technologies to decontaminate fruit products by minimising losses of nutritional and sensorial quality. Microwave heating technology gives the opportunity to have a fast heat process in a continuous mode. Granny Smith apple purée, with natural additives, was prepared and submitted to a) short microwave treatment during 35 s at 652 W. The effects of the treatment were evaluated looking for, the stability of vitamin C, total polyphenol content, as well as viscosity, colour and titratable acidity over a period of two weeks. Its effect on E. coli, L. innocua and indigenous microbiota was evaluated. Results showed that while a reduction of microorganisms was achieved, the treatment could not inactivate the enzymes present in the product and prevent vitamin C degradation. On the other hand the treatment did not affect the stability of the viscosity and titratable acidity during storage period. Industrial relevance: A minimal industrial process of apple products that reduces pathogenic microorganisms, while maintaining nutritional and sensorial attributes is needed to increase the competitiveness of the fruit sector. Short microwave treatment may be a solution to achieve this objective.","920.0"
"From plums to prunes: influence of drying parameters on polyphenols and antioxidant activity","12769544.0","Prunes, which are industrially obtained by dehydrating fresh plums at 85-90 degrees C for 18 h, contain higher levels of phenolic compounds than most other fruits. Prune phenolics have shown beneficial effects on human health. Reports are available in the literature on ascorbic acid, phenol composition, and antioxidant activity of fresh plums and prunes, but there is a lack of publications on the influence of drying parameters on the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. A study was carried out on two plum cultivars using two sets of air-drying temperatures: (i) air temperature at 85 degrees C until 50% of prune moisture level and then the temperature was lowered to 70 degrees C; (ii) air temperature at 60 degrees C. Whole fresh and dried fruits were assessed for phenolics (catechins, hydroxycinnamic acids, anthocyanins, and flavonols), ascorbic acid, and antioxidant activity (all parameters were calculated on a dry matter basis). Analysis of data shows that chlorogenic and neochlorogenic acid changes were affected by both process parameters and cultivar. Drying destroyed anthocyanins, and there was a significant decrease in flavonols. Ascorbic acid was drastically reduced in relation to process temperature. The most striking result was that drying at 85 degrees C doubled antioxidant activity in both cultivars, while contradictory results were found for 60 degrees C processed plums.","921.0"

In general, during refrigerated storage, carotenoids and flavanones remained higher in HP juice than in LPT and PEF juices. Hence, HP and PEF technologies were as effective o even more than LPT to preserve bioactive compounds in orange juice during refrigerated storage.","927.0"
"Compositional characterisation of some apple varieties","","Recent years have seen an increase in research focusing on the amelioration of apple pomace waste for use in the food and nutraceutical industries. Much of this work has concentrated on the characterisation of the polyphenol composition of apple pomace materials to determine their role in conferring nutritional and health benefits. Although apples contain substantial quantities of polymeric procyanidins (condensed tannins), this class of compounds has received limited attention in apple research. This study quantified the polymeric procyanidins in apple pomace extracts using a rapid, methyl-cellulose precipitation (MCP) approach for the first time. In addition, a non-targeted metabolomics approach was applied to determine the most abundant phenolic classes present. Polymeric procyanidins were found to be the most abundant type of polyphenol in apple pomace extracts and were generally oligomeric in nature. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) was most strongly correlated with the polymeric procyanidin concentration. Noting that polymeric procyanidins may not cross the cell layer to exert antioxidant activity in vivo, their presence in apple pomace extracts may therefore overestimate the FRAP. This work highlights the importance of polymeric procyanidins in the phenolic diversity of apple pomaces, and it is proposed that in future studies, rapid MCP assays may be used for their quantification.","928.0"
"Effect of domestic cooking on the red cabbage hydrophilic antioxidants","","The contents of vitamin C, total phenolics, anthocyanins, hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids as well as 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) monocation radical scavenging activity were evaluated in two varieties of red cabbage before and after conventional and steam-cooking. During the conventional cooking 32.7-64.5% of vitamin C and 45.7-66.9% of total phenolics were retained in cooked tissue. Decreasing cooking water volume by half led to better retention of both phenolics (by 2.7-14.5%) and vitamin C (by 14.2-18.4%). However, shortening the cooking time by half affected the retention of phenolics and vitamin C only by 3.8-6.7% and 0-2.2%, respectively. Steam-cooking is recommended to prevent the major loss of scavenging activity, because under these conditions, the corresponding TEAC (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) values were reduced only by 5-20%. Moreover, the content of vitamin C was decreased by 2.1-22.7% while losses of total phenolics were up to 10%. The phenolics are the major source of free radical scavenging activity of red cabbage, since the contribution of vitamin C to TEAC for fresh and cooked red cabbage was from 18.2 to 28.5%.","929.0"
"The content of chlorogenic acids in tropical fruits","","This work investigates the content of feruloylquinic (FQA), caffeoylquinic (CQA) and dicaffeoylquinic (diCQA) acids in the peel, pulp and seed of 22 tropical fruits from Brazil. 3-CQA, 4,5-diCQA and 4- and 5-FQA were not detected in any of the fruits analysed. Relatively small amounts of 4-CQA (4.0–48.7 mg kg−1) were found in the peel and/or pulp of seven of the fruits; only the peel of Artocarpus heterophyllus was significantly (p < 0.05) richer in this acid (1000 mg kg−1). The distribution of 3,4- and 3,5-diCQA in different parts of the fruits was relatively poor, only reaching levels of up to 16.4 mg kg−1. The peel of A heterophyllus also showed the highest amount of 5-CQA (13 000 mg kg−1), while the seed of most fruits generally contained a lower amount of this acid than the peel or pulp. On the basis of the 5-CQA content found in the pulp, 15 of the fruits were classified as follows: very low concentration (4.4–15.8 mg kg−1), low concentration (28.9–66.4 mg kg−1), medium concentration (132 mg kg−1), high concentration (473–474 mg kg−1) or very high concentration (1730 mg kg−1); however, no 5-CQA was detected in the pulp of the other seven fruits.

Orally administered to rats, dihydrocaffeic acid was very rapidly absorbed most probably by the gastric or duodenal epithelium and excreted in urine as free and conjugated forms. LC-MS2 analysis of plasma and urine samples allowed confident identification of the dihydrocaffeic acid metabolites. The parent compound was glucuronidated, sulphated or methylated, on one of the hydroxyl groups present on its phenyl ring. All the dihydrocaffeic acid metabolites peaked in plasma within the first 30min following ingestion, suggesting a metabolism possibly by the gastric or duodenal cells and by the liver. Using in vitro and ex vivo models of the intestinal epithelium and the liver, the identity and source of the metabolites detected in vivo were examined. The data obtained suggest that, in rats, intestinal cells are more able to glucuronidate dihydrocaffeic acid, whereas liver favours sulphation. Moreover, glucuronidation, sulphation and methylation seem to be regio-selective, preferably on the 3-OH of dihydrocaffeic acid. The methyl conjugate, dihydroferulic acid, was shown to be oxidized into ferulic acid by intestinal and hepatic cells, which were also able to perform the reverse reaction, the reduction of ferulic acid into dihydroferulic acid. As a conclusion, the main form of dihydrocaffeic acid circulating in plasma after its ingestion is a mixture of different primary and secondary metabolites.","931.0"
"Organic acids and phenolic compounds in pomegranates (Punica granatum L.) grown in Turkey","","Thirteen pomegranate varieties obtained from four different growing regions of Turkey were analyzed for their individual organic acids and phenolic compounds in freshly prepared pomegranate juices. Total titratable acidity ranged between 4.58 and 17.30 g/L (average of 9.82 g/L), and total sugars ranged between 139.6 and 160.6 g/L (average of 148.75 g/L) in pomegranate juices. According to the results of the z-test for comparison of means, intervarietal differences in total titratable acidity and sugar content of pomegranate varieties were found to be significant within the confidence interval of 95%. Organic acids such as citric, L-malic, tartaric, oxalic, (-) - quinic and succinic acids were individually detected and quantitated. On average, citric acid was predominant with a range of 0.33-8.96 g/L (overall mean of 4.85+/-2.83 g/L). L-Malic acid was the second most abundant, with a range of 0.56-6.86 g/L (overall mean of 1.75+/-1.59 g/L). Tartaric, oxalic, (-) - quinic and succinic acids ranged between 0.28-2.83, 0.02-6.72, 0.00-0.82 and 0.00-1.54 g/L, respectively. Phenolic compounds identified in freshly prepared pomegranate juices were gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, o- and p-coumaric acids, catechin, phloridzin and quercetin.","932.0"
"Identification of puerarin and its metabolites in rats by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","15186086.0","Puerarin (daidzein-8-C-glucoside) is the major bioactive isoflavone of kudzu root (the root of Pueraria lobata). Its metabolic fate, however, is not well-known. In this study, a sensitive and specific LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the determination of puerarin and its metabolites daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, and equol was developed for their analysis in biological samples. Two new metabolites of puerarin, mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives, were detected in the urine and feces of rats after oral administration. The persistence of puerarin in blood and urine as the principal metabolic form for the period of 4-72 h after oral administration suggested that puerarin is rapidly absorbed from the intestine without metabolism. Its presence in organs such as the brain suggests that this glucoside may enter tissues by specific transport pathways. Study of these metabolites may provide further understanding of the health beneficial effects of puerarin in kudzu dietary supplements.","933.0"
"Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry identification of proanthocyanidins in rat plasma after oral administration of grape seed extract","19095430.0","Proanthocyanidin rich plant extracts derived from grape seed extract (GSE), hawthorn and cranberry are on markets for their preventive effects against cardiovascular diseases and uroinfections in woman. However, the importance of these health beneficial effects of these botanicals remains elusive due to incomplete understanding of uptake, metabolism and bioavailability of proanthocyanidins in vivo. In the present study rats were given GSE orally (300 mg/kg, twice a day) and blood and urine were collected over a 24 h period. Monomeric catechins and their methylated metabolites, and proanthocyanidins up to trimers were detected in blood samples treated with GSE using LC-MS/MS operating in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. A new tetramethylated metabolite of dimeric proanthocyanidin (m/z 633) in GSE-treated urine was tentatively identified. Using LC-MS/MS, (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin were identified in the brain conclusively. These data suggested that GSE catechins cross the blood brain barrier and may be responsible for the neuroprotective effects of GSE.","934.0"
"Determination of isoflavones in commercial soy products by HPLC and coulometric electrode array detection","","Polyphenolic compounds (PCs) have received exceptional attention at the end of the past millennium and as much at the beginning of the new one. Undoubtedly, these compounds in foodstuffs provide added value for their well-known health benefits, for their technological role and also marketing. Many efforts have been made to provide simple, effective and user friendly analytical methods for the determination and antioxidant capacity (AOC) evaluation of food polyphenols. In a parallel track, over the last twenty years, nanomaterials (NMs) have made their entry in the analytical chemistry domain; NMs have, in fact, opened new paths for the development of analytical methods with the common aim to improve analytical performance and sustainability, becoming new tools in quality assurance of food and beverages. The aim of this review is to provide information on the most recent developments of new NMs-based tools and strategies for total polyphenols (TP) determination and AOC evaluation in food. In this review optical, electrochemical and bioelectrochemical approaches have been reviewed. The use of nanoparticles, quantum dots, carbon nanomaterials and hybrid materials for the detection of polyphenols is the main subject of the works reported. However, particular attention has been paid to the success of the application in real samples, in addition to the NMs. In particular, the discussion has been focused on methods/devices presenting, in the opinion of the authors, clear advancement in the fields, in terms of simplicity, rapidity and usability. This review aims to demonstrate how the NM-based approaches represent valid alternatives to classical methods for polyphenols analysis, and are mature to be integrated for the rapid quality assessment of food quality in lab or directly in the field.","935.0"
"Variations in the amounts of individual flavonols in a range of green teas","","This study aims at investigating the phytochemistry and biological effects of three different flavored black teas from Sweden. Analyses were conducted using gas and liquid chromatography. The major volatile compounds of all the tea samples were found to be linalyl acetate and α-terpineol. HPLC results indicated caffeine levels of 1.08%, 1.46%, and 1.18% in samples Ht1, Ht2, and Ht3, respectively. Ht1 exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, particularly in DPPH<sup>·</sup> and ABTS<sup>+</sup> radical scavenging capacities (0.15 and 0.21 mgTE/g, respectively). Additionally, Ht1 also showed higher antioxidant activity than the other samples in both CUPRAC and FRAP tests. Metal chelation capacity was highest in Ht3, suggesting significant chelation potential due to nonphenolic components. Ht1 showed strong inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (1.21 mg GALAE/g), butyrylcholinesterase (3.48 mg GALAE/g), and tyrosinase (1.47 mg KAE/g) enzymes.

"Analysis of the major flavonol glycosides present in four varieties of Onion (Allium cepa) and changes in composition resulting from autolysis","","The major flavonoids of mature onion bulb were confirmed as the 3,4'-O-diglucoside (Qdg) and 4'-O-monoglucoside (Qmg) of quercetin using a combination of chromatographic comparisons, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These two components account for over 85% of the total flavonoids in three varieties of onion with Qdg as the main component. Quercetin is detected in these long stored onions but only at low levels of less than 2% of the total. The remaining flavonoid fraction (approx 15%) comprises upto 17 different components of which quercetin-3-O-glucoside and isorhamnetin glucoside are prominent members although each contribute less than 1% of the total flavonoid fraction. There are significant differences in the levels of Qdg and Qmg between the four different onion varieties analysed; Qdg varying from 50-1300 mg kg-1 fresh onion tissue and Qmg from 36-394 mg kg-1. Maceration of the tissue for the three varieties tested led to a loss of Qdg and the appearance of Qmg and free quercetin. In the variety Rijnsburger 50% of the Qdg was degraded in 5 h and had completely disappeared after 24 h. These changes in Qdg can be quantitatively explained by increases in Qmg and free quercetin. The possible significance of quercetin glycosides in the diet is discussed.","937.0"
"Effect of storage and domestic processing on the content and composition of flavonol glucosides in onion (Allium cepa)","","The stability of the major flavonol glucosides, quercetin 3,4'-O-diglucoside (QDG) and quercetin 4'-O-monoglucoside (QMG), was studied in two varieties of onion (Red Baron and Crossbow) that were cured and stored for 6 months under normal commercial conditions and analyzed at regular intervals. Onions were also cooked by boiling in water and by frying in oil under normal domestic conditions. Apart from a 50% loss of quercetin 4'-O-monoglucoside during the initial drying process, little change in content and composition was observed over 6 months of storage. Neither boiling nor frying resulted in interconversion of the quercetin conjugates or production of free quercetin, although a 25% loss overall was recorded for each process.","938.0"

"Antioxidant capacity as influenced by total phenolic and anthocyanin content, maturity, and variety of Vaccinium species","","Blueberries, widely recognized for their antioxidant capacity, have driven rapid growth in China's blueberry industry owing to their significant health benefits and economic value. However, a comprehensive evaluation for blueberry quality traits and antioxidant capacity remains lacking in China's domestic research. This study systematically evaluated 26 highbush blueberry cultivars with consistent tree age and cultivation practices, which can better reflect cultivar-dependent trait variation. Key findings revealed Earliblue exhibited the highest soluble solid content (SSC) and the lowest titratable acidity (TA), while Bluechip had the most abundant vitamin C (VC). Glucose and fructose were the main components of soluble sugars in highbush blueberries, accounting for over 97% of the total sugars. Citric acid was the dominant organic acid in nearly all cultivars. Malvidin 3-<i>O</i>-galactoside, delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-galactoside, delphinidin 3-<i>O</i>-arabinoside, malvidin 3-<i>O</i>-arabinoside and petunidin 3-<i>O</i>-galactoside were the most abundant anthocyanins. The 26 blueberry cultivars were graded into high-, medium- and low-anthocyanin content groups. Correlation analysis divided the 14 anthocyanins into two types: antioxidant-related anthocyanins and other anthocyanins. The five cultivars with the highest comprehensive evaluation scores were Sunrise, Bluegold, Elliott, Amblue and Briteblue. These results may establish empirical selection criteria for the selection and efficient utilization of high-quality blueberry cultivars.","943.0"
"Urinary excretion of phenolic acids in rats fed cranberry","20052972.0","Dietary flavonoids can be converted into phenolic acids by colonic microflora. Phenolic acids can then be absorbed into the circulation and may contribute to the health-promoting effects of the parent compounds. Phenolic acids can be further metabolized in other tissues via methylation and conjugation with glucuronide or sulfate. The objectives of this study were to identify and quantify the urinary excretion of 19 phenolic acids and their conjugates in rats fed three levels of a concentrated cranberry powder (3.3, 6.6, and 33 mg/kg of diet). The basic diet used was AIN93G diet containing very low amounts of any polyphenolic compounds. Of the phenolic acids studied, the amounts excreted varied by 4 orders of magnitude, with hippuric acid being excreted in the highest quantities. Amounts of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3HPAA), 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid (3HPPA), and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4HCA) excreted were in the range of 18-33 microg/mg creatinine in animals fed the highest level of cranberry powder, whereas phenylacetic acid (PAA), gallic acid (GA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (34HPAA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (34HBA), 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (34HCA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid (FA) were excreted in the urine in concentrations of 0.1-2 microg/mg creatinine. As the amount of cranberry in the diet was increased, the amount of 4HPAA excreted decreased but the percentage of conjugated 4HPAA excreted increased (from 57 to 91%). For other phenolic acids analyzed, the percentage excreted in the conjugated form was approximately constant across levels of cranberry in the diet and ranged from 65 to 100% for the individual phenolic acids. Studies of bioactivity and health effects need to consider more than just the compound(s) in the food, because they can be metabolized to other lower molecular weight compounds, which in turn may also be methylated or conjugated in some form that may affect the perceived health effects.","944.0"
"RP-HPLC analysis of the phenolic compounds of plant extracts.

"Ultrasonically assisted extraction of phenolic compounds from aromatic plants: Comparison with conventional extraction technics","","Extracts of aromatic plants contain bioactive substances such as phenolic compounds, which could be used as natural antioxidants. Conventional, as well as ultrasonically assisted extractions (UAEs) of phenolic compounds from aromatic plants using different solvents, have been studied. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with ultraviolet detection was employed for the analysis of phenolic compounds. Total phenolic compounds were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The amount of extractable phenolic substances for this method decreased with decreasing polarity of the solvent in the order water, 60% methanol, 60% acetone, and ethyl acetate/water (60:30, v/v). The HPLC results indicate that UAE is a more effective technic compared to the conventional method but was dependent on the solvent and the temperature employed. Increasing the temperature of sonication, the efficiency of extraction of phenolic compounds for all solvents is enhanced. However, water extraction was found to give reduced amounts of phenolic compounds when compared with the conventional method.","947.0"
"Flavanone glycosides in Brazilian orange juice","","Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide, and the process of cardiac remodeling lies at the core of most of these diseases. Sustained cardiac remodeling almost unavoidably ends in progressive muscle dysfunction, heart failure, and ultimately death. Therefore, in order to attenuate cardiac remodeling and reduce mortality, different therapies have been used, but it is important to identify adjuvant factors that can help to modulate this process. One of these factors is the inclusion of affordable foods in the diet with potential cardioprotective properties. Orange juice intake has been associated with several beneficial metabolic changes, which may influence cardiac remodeling induced by cardiovascular diseases. Current opinion highlights how the metabolites and metabolic pathways modulated by orange juice consumption could potentially attenuate cardiac remodeling. It was observed that orange juice intake significantly modulates phospholipids, energy metabolism, endocannabinoid signaling, amino acids, and gut microbiota diversity, improving insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. Specifically, modulation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) metabolism and activation of PPARα and PPARγ receptors, associated with improved energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress, showed protective effects on the heart. Furthermore, orange juice intake positively impacted gut microbiota diversity and led to an increase in beneficial bacterial populations, correlated with improved metabolic syndrome. These findings suggest that orange juice may act as a metabolic modulator, with potential therapeutic implications for cardiac remodeling associated with cardiovascular diseases.","948.0"
"Blanching and long-term freezing affect various bioactive compounds of vegetables in different ways","","An extensive study on the effects of blanching/freezing and long-term freezer storage on various bioactive compounds of more than 20 commonly used vegetables was performed. Effects were strongly plant species-dependent. Contents of dietary fibre components either were not affected or increased slightly. Minerals in general were also stable, but some losses of soluble minerals by leaching were observed. Phenolic antioxidants and vitamins were clearly more sensitive. Significant losses (20-30%) of antioxidant activity and total phenolics were detected in many vegetables. A qualitative HPLC profiling method for phenolic antioxidants was developed which proved to be very useful when evaluating the complex behaviour of phenolics during food processing. Up to one-third of vitamin C contents were lost during blanching, and further slight losses were detected during storage. Folic acid turned out to be very sensitive to blanching, with more than half of the vitamin being lost, but was stable during freezer storage. Carotenoids and sterols were not affected by blanching or freezer storage. The usefulness of the applied screening methods for evaluation of the effects of processing on vegetables is shown.","949.0"

"Comparative study on antioxidant properties of carrot juice stabilised by high-intensity pulsed electric fields or heat treatments","","BACKGROUND: The effect of high-intensity pulsed electric field (HIPEF) processing (35 kV cm⁻¹ for 1500 μs using 6-μs bipolar pulses at 200 Hz) on the antioxidant features (vitamin C, β-carotene, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity) of carrot juice as well as on peroxidase activity was investigated and compared to the observed in heat pasteurised juices (90 °C for 60 s or 30 s) having the fresh juice as a reference.RESULTS: HIPEF and heat-treated carrot juices had higher β-carotene and lower vitamin C contents than the untreated juices immediately after processing. The antioxidant capacity of the juices was significantly modified neither by HIPEF nor by thermal treatments. POD activity decreased drastically (greater-than-or-equal93.3%) after processing irrespective of the treatment applied. Vitamin C and β-carotene content decreased throughout the storage following an exponential trend (R² = 0.801-0.984) with degradation rates between 1.7 x 10⁻² and 3.5 x 10⁻² day⁻¹. Vitamin C and β-carotene contents were better maintained in HIPEF-treated than in heat-pasteurised juices throughout the storage. Total phenolic content and the antioxidant capacity of the HIPEF-treated juice did not substantially differ from that of the thermally treated juice for 56 days.CONCLUSION: HIPEF processing may help to achieve fresh-like carrot juices with increased amounts of health-related phytochemicals.","951.0"
"Phenolic composition, browning susceptibility, and carotenoid content of several apricot cultivars at maturity","","<i>Passiflora cincinnata</i> (Mast), native to the Brazilian semi-arid region, produces exotic fruits even under low water availability. However, its green coloration at ripening complicates optimal harvesting, impacting post-harvest fruit quality. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the influence of cultivation systems (irrigated and rainfed) and different ripening stages on the physical and post-harvest characteristics of wild passion fruit during the second production cycle. The experiment was conducted using a randomized block design in a 2 × 4 factorial scheme, corresponding to two cultivation systems (irrigated and rainfed) and four fruit ripening stages (60, 80, 100, and 120 days after anthesis-DAA), with five replications. The fruit pulps were analyzed for physicochemical characterization and bioactive compounds. The physical and chemical characteristics of wild passion fruit were influenced by ripening stages and the irrigation system. The rainfed system decreased the total fruit mass by 15.50% compared to the irrigated cultivation. Additionally, the rainfed cultivation reduced the fruit color index by 14.82% and altered the respiratory pattern, causing a linear decrease of 73.37% in the respiration rate during ripening, in contrast to the behavior observed in the irrigated system, which reached an estimated minimum rate of 33.74 mg CO<sub>2</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> at 110 days after anthesis.","952.0"

"Antioxidant activity and nutrient composition of selected cereals for food use","","Whole grain products are recommended for healthy diets as being recognized sources of dietary fiber and antioxidant substances. In the present study, four cereals including barley, pearl millet, rye and sorghum which are adapted to the growing conditions in the United Arab Emirates were evaluated in terms of their composition of dietary fiber, resistant starch, minerals and total phenols and antioxidant properties. Antioxidant activity was evaluated on the basis of scavenging capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and 2,2'-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate] (ABTS radical cations). The adapted grains exhibited better nutritional quality compared to commercial hard and soft wheat flours, the main ingredients in grain-based food products. They were significantly rich in resistant starch, soluble and insoluble dietary fibers, minerals and antioxidants. Barley had the highest levels of phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, copper, and zinc, and the second highest content of iron following millet. Sorghum was exceptionally high in antioxidant activities followed by millet and barley. The antioxidant properties of the three grains were comparable to butylated hydroxytoluene.

Soluble solids, acidity, and anthocyanins were also determined. Hydroxycinnamic acids were more abundant in blood orange than in blond juices. Ferulic acid was the major component in all cases, but the distribution of the four acids was typical in each variety. Discriminant analysis of the experimental results showed that these acids could be used as markers of blood and blond varieties.

"Antioxidant effectiveness as influenced by phenolic content of fresh orange juices","10552879.0","Several fresh orange juices, obtained from five different Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck varieties (three pigmented varieties, Moro, Sanguinello, and Tarocco, and two blond varieties, Valencia late and Washington navel), were subjected to antioxidant profile determination (including total polyphenols, flavanones, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, and ascorbic acid). The antioxidant activity of these juices was then assessed by means of different ""in vitro"" tests (bleaching of the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical; peroxidation, induced by the water-soluble radical initiator 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride, on mixed dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/linoleic acid unilamellar vesicles; scavenging activity against nitric oxide; total antioxidant status). All orange juices tested showed an evident antioxidant effect. Our findings indicate the following: (1) the antioxidant efficiency of orange juices may be attributed, in a significant part at least, to their content of total phenols, (2) while ascorbic acid seems to play a minor role; (3) the antioxidant activity of orange juices is related not only to structural features of phytochemicals contained in them, but also to their capability to interact with biomembranes; (4) finally, as to pigmented juices, their antioxidant efficiency appears to be widely influenced by the anthocyanin level. One could speculate that the supply of natural antioxidant phenols through daily consumption of orange juice might provide additional protection against in vivo oxidation of cellular biomolecules.","957.0"

Spectrophotometric methods utilizing aqueous ethanol as a solvent provided an anthocyanin content higher than that determined by HPLC. Discrepancies were ascribed to the use of impure standards and/or unsuitable calibration lines. The most consistent results with the HPLC findings were obtained by a method utilizing water as a solvent and cyanidin-3-glucoside as a standard. Actual concentration of anthocyanins in blood orange juice was remarkably lower than that currently determined by procedures used in the juice producing factories.","958.0"
"Effect of cold storage on vitamin C, phenolics and antioxidant activity of five orange genotypes Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck","","<i>Citrus limon var. pompia Camarda var. nova</i>, commonly known as pompia, is a distinctive citrus ecotype native to Sardinia, notable for its unique botanical, phytochemical, and potential health benefits. It holds cultural significance as a traditional food product of Sardinia, recognized by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies. This comprehensive review examines pompia's traditional uses, taxonomic classification, pomological characteristics, phytochemical profile, and potential health benefits. Pompia phytochemical analyses reveal a rich composition of flavonoids and terpenoids, with notable concentrations of limonene, myrcene, and various oxygenated monoterpenes. Pompia essential oils are primarily extracted from its peel and leaves. Peel essential oils exhibit a high concentration of the monoterpene limonene (82%) and significantly lower quantities of myrcene (1.8%), geranial (1.7%), geraniol (1.5%), and neral (1.4%). In its rind extract, flavanones such as naringin (23.77 µg/mg), neoeriocitrin (46.53 µg/mg), and neohesperidin (44.57 µg/mg) have been found, along with gallic acid (128.3 µg/mg) and quinic acid (219.67 µg/mg). The main compounds detected in the essential oils from pompia leaves are oxygenated monoterpenes (53.5%), with limonene (28.64%), α-terpineol (41.18%), geranial (24.44%), (E)-β-ocimene (10.5%), linalool (0.56%), and neryl acetate (13.56%) being particularly prominent. In pompia juice, the presence of phenolic compounds has been discovered, with a composition more similar to lemon juice than orange juice. The primary flavonoid identified in pompia juice is chrysoeriol-6,8-di-C-glucoside (stellarin-2) (109.2 mg/L), which has not been found in other citrus juices. The compound rhoifolin-4-glucoside (17.5 mg/L) is unique to pompia juice, whereas its aglycone, rhoifolin, is found in lemon juice. Other flavonoids identified in pompia juice include diosmetin 6,8-C-diglucoside (54.5 mg/L) and isorhamnetin 3-O-rutinoside (79.4 mg/L). These findings support the potential of pompia in developing nutraceuticals and natural health products, further confirmed by its compounds' antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. Future research should focus on optimizing extraction methods, conducting clinical trials to evaluate efficacy and safety, and exploring sustainable cultivation practices. The potential applications of pompia extracts in food preservation, functional foods, and cosmetic formulations also warrant further investigation. Addressing these areas could significantly enhance pompia's contribution to natural medicine, food science, and biotechnology.","959.0"
"Analysis and quantification of trans-resveratrol in wines from Alentejo region (Portugal)","","Aroma compounds from varietal wines, five white and five red from Évora, Alentejo and two varietal wines from five other regions of Alentejo were studied during a two-year period. Fermentative compounds and glycoconjugated aroma compounds (terpenes, norisoprenoids) were analyzed by means of gas chromatography (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results show that fermentative aromatic compounds are related to the vintage rather than to the region or variety. Compounds released by enzymatic and acid hydrolysis of the glycosidic bound aroma compounds are quite suitable for varietal characterization. Some ratios among these compounds remain the same regardless of the vintage or the origin of the wine.","960.0"
"Effects of food processing on flavonoids and lycopene status in a Mediterranean tomato variety","12180131.0","This research is focused on the antioxidant properties of dietary components, in particular phenolics and carotenoids and the assessment of the contribution of the combined antioxidants to the total antioxidant activity (TAA) of tomato fruit. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of processing on the antioxidant properties of tomato. The effects of three different methods of processing fresh tomatoes into tomato sauce were investigated with respect to the antioxidant properties of the fruit. Identification and quantification of the main carotenoids and flavonoids present in tomatoes was achieved by HPLC analysis and the effect on the concentration and availability of these compounds was investigated at different stages of the processing. The processing affected mainly naringenin causing a reduction in the concentration. Conversely, levels of chlorogenic acid were increased suggesting an improvement in availability of this compound to extraction. The concentration of all-trans-lycopene was also increased following processing. Less than 10% isomerisation of all-trans-lycopene to the cis form was detected for all the methods analysed. The effects of processing on the overall antioxidant activity support the theory of a general improvement in availability of individual antioxidants. For both hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts TAA values were increased.","961.0"
"Novel biomarkers of the metabolism of caffeic acid derivatives in vivo","11368919.0","The purpose of this study was to investigate biomarkers of the bioavailability and metabolism of hydroxycinnamate derivatives through the determination of the pharmacokinetics of their urinary elimination and identification of the metabolites excreted. Coffee was used as a rich source of caffeic acid derivatives and human supplementation was undertaken. The results show a highly significant increase in the excretion of ferulic, isoferulic, dihydroferulic acid (3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-propionic acid), and vanillic acid postsupplementation relative to the levels presupplementation. Thus, ferulic, isoferulic, and dihydroferulic acids are specific biomarkers for the bioavailability and metabolism of dietary caffeic acid esters. Isoferulic acid is a unique biomarker as it is not a dietary component, however, dihydroferulic acid may well derive from other flavonoids with a structurally related B-ring. 3-Hydroxyhippuric acid has also been identified as an indicator for bioavailability and metabolism of phenolic compounds, and shows a highly significant excretion increase postsupplementation. The results reveal isoferulic acid (and possibly dihydroferulic acid) as novel markers of caffeoyl quinic acid metabolism.","962.0"
"Black tea represents a major source of dietary phenolics among regular tea drinkers","12516885.0","The phenolic composition and antioxidant activities [TEAC, ORAC, FRAP] of consumer brews (1 tea bag in 230 ml for 1 min) of seven different brands of black tea from the British market were investigated. The main phenolic compounds identified were epigallocatechin gallate, four theaflavins, as well as epicatechin gallate, theogallin (tentative assignment), quercetin-3-rutinoside and 4-caffeoyl quinic acid. Thearubigins represented an estimated 75-82% of the total phenolics. Further, polyphenol fractions were in decreasing order theaflavins, flavan-3-ols, flavonols, gallic acids and hydroxycinnamates. On average, a cup of a consumer brew of black tea is providing polyphenols at the level of 262mg GAE/serving, of which 65 mg were assigned to individual polyphenols. The antioxidant activity of black tea preparations is higher than that of most reported dietary agents on a daily basis. Correlations were observed between the antioxidant activities and the sum of all quantified polyphenols by HPLC analysis as well as with the total phenolics. Treatment of the black tea brew with simulated gastric juice resulted in a significant increase of the identified theaflavins implying a partial cleavage of thearubigins in the environment of the gastric lumen. Therefore, black tea can be considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and/or antioxidants.","963.0"
"The metabolism of dietary polyphenols and the relevance to circulating levels of conjugated metabolites","12592675.0","Berry extracts rich in anthocyanins have been linked to protective effects including the modulation of age-related neurological dysfunction and the improvement of the resistance of red blood cells against oxidative stress in vitro. In this study the bioavailability, metabolism and elimination of polyphenols from blackcurrant juice, rich in anthocyanins, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamates, were investigated. The four major native anthocyanidin glycosides of blackcurrant juice, delphinidin-3-glucoside, delphinidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside, were detected and identified in low amounts by HPLC and LC-MS in plasma and urine post-ingestion. Elimination of the anthocyanins was fast (maximum excretion after 1 h) and plasma levels (0-128.6 nmol/l) and total urinary exretion (0.07-1.35 mg; 0.007-0.133% of the dose ingested) were low. Most significantly, of the hydroxycinnamates, conjugated and free ferulic, isoferulic, p-coumaric, sinapic and vanillic acids were identified in plasma and urine, using GC-MS techniques. Quercetin and kaempferol (as glucuronides) and the proposed colonic metabolite of quercetin, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, were detectable in a minority of subjects. Increased daily urinary hippuric, 4-hydroxyhippuric and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid levels were also observed post-ingestion in all volunteers.","964.0"
"Effect of different domestic processing and cooking methods on the tannin contents of lentils (Lens esculenta)","","Antinutrients, also known as anti-nutritional factors (ANFs), are compounds found in many plant-based foods that can limit the bioavailability of nutrients or can act as precursors to toxic substances. ANFs have controversial effects on human health, depending mainly on their concentration. While the positive effects of these compounds are well documented, the dangers they pose and the approaches to avoid them have not been discussed to the same extent. There is no dispute that many ANFs negatively alter the absorption of vitamins, minerals, and proteins in addition to inhibiting some enzyme activities, thus negatively affecting the bioavailability of nutrients in the human body. This review discusses the chemical properties, plant bioavailability, and deleterious effects of anti-minerals (phytates and oxalates), glycosides (cyanogenic glycosides and saponins), polyphenols (tannins), and proteinaceous ANFs (enzyme inhibitors and lectins). The focus of this study is on the possibility of controlling the amount of ANF in food through fermentation. An overview of the most common biochemical pathways for their microbial reduction is provided, showing the genetic basis of these phenomena, including the active enzymes, the optimal conditions of action, and some data on the regulation of their synthesis.","965.0"
"Optimisation of gradient HPLC analysis of phenolic compounds and favonoids in beer using a CoulArray detector","15587285.0","A method was developed for simultaneous analysis of natural antioxidants in beer using multichannel electrochemical detection with a CoulArray detector, which enables selective and sensitive antioxidant detection in gradient HPLC and facilitates the identification of analytes based on the ratios of signals recorded at different potentials applied to the detection cells arranged in series. The separation conditions were optimised for 27 phenolic compounds including derivatives of benzoic and cinnamic acids, flavones, and a few related glycosides identified in beer samples. Separation selectivities of 11 columns with different stationary phase chemistries were compared, and the pH and gradient programs were optimised for the individual columns to provide best resolution and high number of resolved peaks, using the window-diagram approach. The effects of pH on the sensitivity of electrochemical coulometric detection were considered in the optimisation approach. The optimised conditions were applied to the analysis of real beer samples.","966.0"
"Determination of naringin in grapefruit juice by cathodic stripping differential pulse voltammetry at the hanging mercury drop electrode","","A simple and rapid differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) method using a single-use electroactivated pencil graphite electrode (PGE*) is proposed for the rapid screening of the total content of polyphenolics (TCP) with intermediate antioxidant power (AOP) in grapefruit peel and fresh juice. The results were compared and correlated with those provided by the HPLC-DAD-MS method. NG voltammetric behavior at PGE* was studied by cyclic voltammetry and an oxidation mechanism was suggested. The experimental conditions (type of PGE, electroactivation procedure, pH, nature and concentration of supporting electrolyte) for NG DPV determination were optimized. The NG peak current varied linearly with the concentration in the ranges 1.40 × 10<sup>-6</sup>-2.00 × 10<sup>-5</sup> and 2.00 × 10<sup>-5</sup>-1.40 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mol/L NG and a limit of detection (LoD) of 6.02 × 10<sup>-7</sup> mol/L NG was attained. The method repeatability expressed as relative standard deviation was 7.62% for the concentration level of 2.00 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L NG. After accumulation for 240 s of NG at PGE* the LoD was lowered to 1.35 × 10<sup>-7</sup> mol/L NG, the linear range being 6.00 × 10<sup>-7</sup>-8.00 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L NG. The developed electrochemical system was successfully tested on real samples and proved to be a cost-effective tool for the simple estimation of the TCP with intermediate AOP in citrus fruits.","967.0"
"Antioxidative and antimutagenic activities and polyphenol content of pesticide-free and organically cultivated green vegetables using water-soluble chitosan as a soil modifier and leaf surface spray","","Five green vegetables (qing-gen-cai, Chinese Cabbage, spinach, Welsh onion and green pepper) commonly used in our daily diet were analysed to determine their antioxidative and antimutagenic activities and chemical content of polyphenols. We obtained pesticide-free and organically cultivated (O) vegetables using water-soluble chitosan as a soil modifier and leaf surface spray (as an alternative natural insecticide) in order to investigate biofunctions induced or enhanced by such specialised cultivation practices. In addition, we purchased the same varieties of vegetables cultivated on an adjacent farm in the conventional manner (C) using pesticides and chemical fertilisers in order to examine the differences in biological activities and distribution of constituents responsible for such activities. The antioxidative activity shown by O vegetables was 120% times higher than that shown by C vegetables in the case of spinach and 20-50% higher in the case of Welsh onion, Chinese cabbage and qing-gen-cai. In comparison with C vegetables, the antimutagenic activity shown by O vegetables was higher against 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4NQO) in qing-gen-cai, Chinese cabbage and Welsh onion, against benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in all five vegetables, against 2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) in qing-gen-cai, Chinese cabbage and green pepper and against 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole acetate (Trp-P-2) in spinach only. Among all green vegetable juices tested for flavonoid composition, quercitrin, caffeic acid and baicalein in O vegetables were detected in concentrations 1.3-10.4 times higher than those found in C vegetables, suggesting the influence of different cultivation practices.","968.0"
"Analysis of flavonol aglycones in wine extracts by high performance liquid chromatography","","Colored highland barley is a promising nutrient-rich functional food. However, antioxidant capacity after fermentation and the quality of the resulting wine remain unexplored. This study investigated how the accumulation of non-volatile metabolites in four fermented colored highland barley varieties influences antioxidant capacity and wine quality. Comprehensive metabolomic analysis identified 1602 distinct non-volatile metabolites, with 486, 229, and 392 showing differential accumulation in black, purple, and blue varieties, respectively, compared with the yellow variety. Key differentially accumulated metabolites were enriched in flavonoid, flavone, flavonol, and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways, significantly influencing antioxidant capacity. Interactions among glucose, organic acids, and metabolites contributed to the unique flavor of highland barley wine. Differences in physicochemical characteristics and flavor compounds offer consumers a diverse selection of highland barley wines. These results provide valuable insights for the further investigation of functional components in colored highland barley and the development of high-quality highland barley wine.","969.0"

"Urinary composition and postprandial blood changes in H-secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) metabolites in rats do not differ between acute and chronic SDG treatments","10958827.0","Although chronic exposure to secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG) was shown to alter (3)H-SDG metabolite disposition in rats, the proportion of measured radioactivity attributed to known or unknown SDG metabolites was not determined. Using HPLC and GC-MS, two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of acute (1 d) vs. chronic (10 d) SDG treatment on major urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG in female, Sprague-Dawley rats (70-72-d-old) over a 48-h period and if new urinary metabolites were detectable in rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG. A third experiment was conducted to determine changes in postprandial blood levels of (3)H-SDG metabolites over a 24-h period with acute or chronic SDG treatment. Regardless of treatment, enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol accounted for 75-80% of urine radioactivity. Four potential new lignan metabolites, two of which were detected in the urine of rats fed nonradioactive flaxseed or SDG, were found. Type of treatment had no effect on levels of individual urinary metabolites of (3)H-SDG. As observed for plasma lignans in women fed flaxseed, blood radioactivity peaked at 9 h and remained high until 24 h in both treatment groups, suggesting that blood lignan kinetics might be similar with flaxseed or SDG consumption and that they were comparable between humans and rats. In conclusion, the main urinary lignan metabolites were enterodiol, enterolactone and secoisolariciresinol. Urinary composition or blood levels of radioactive lignans were not affected by the duration of SDG exposure. Thus, while chronic SDG exposure alters lignan disposition in rats, it does not change the metabolite profile.","972.0"
"Nutritional comparison of fresh , frozen and canned fruits and vegetables. Part 1 . Vitamins C and B and phenolic compounds","","The first of a two-part review of the recent and classical literature reveals that loss of nutrients in fresh products during storage and cooking may be more substantial than commonly perceived. Depending on the commodity, freezing and canning processes may preserve nutrient value. The initial thermal treatment of processed products can cause loss of water-soluble and oxygen-labile nutrients such as vitamin C and the B vitamins. However, these nutrients are relatively stable during subsequent canned storage owing to the lack of oxygen. Frozen products lose fewer nutrients initially because of the short heating time in blanching, but they lose more nutrients during storage owing to oxidation. Phenolic compounds are also water-soluble and oxygen-labile, but changes during processing, storage and cooking appear to be highly variable by commodity. Further studies would facilitate the understanding of the changes in these phytochemicals. Changes in moisture content during storage, cooking and processing can misrepresent changes in nutrient content. These findings indicate that exclusive recommendations of fresh produce ignore the nutrient benefits of canned and frozen products. Nutritional comparison would be facilitated if future research would express nutrient data on a dry weight basis to account for changes in moisture.","973.0"

"Inhibition of induced DNA oxidative damage by beers: correlation with the content of polyphenols and melanoidins","15853413.0","Beers are a source of dietary flavonoids; however, there exist differences in composition, alcohol concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these differences, three kinds of lager beer of habitual consumption in Spain, dark, blond, and alcohol-free, were assayed for total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities, and in vitro inhibitory effect on DNA oxidative damage. Furthermore, their melanoidin content and correlation with antioxidant activity were evaluated. Dark beer contained the highest total phenolic (489 +/- 52 mg/L) and melanoidin (1.49 +/- 0.02 g/L) contents with a 2-fold difference observed when compared to the alcohol-free beer. For the three kinds of beer, the antioxidant activity measured as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride concentration was strongly correlated with the total polyphenol content (R(2) = 0.91102, p < 0.005) and with the melanoidin content (R(2) = 0.7999, p < 0.05). The results support a positive effect of beers on the protection of DNA oxidative damage, by decreasing the deoxyribose degradation, DNA scission (measured by electrophoresis), and inhibition of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation.

"Effect of curing and cooking on flavonols and anthocyanins in traditional varieties of onion bulbs","","The stability of the major flavonol glucosides and anthocyanins was studied in two regional varieties of Portuguese onion (a white variety “branca da Póvoa” and a red variety “vermelha da Póvoa”). White and red onions from 2007 and 2008 harvests were subjected to field curing with and without light, but the red cultivar from 2008 was also subjected to typical domestic processing, including chopping and different cooking treatments. Field curing resulted in increases in quercetin content compared to levels at lifting, especially important for all white bulbs (33-40% increase). Flavonol and anthocyanin levels in onions cured in the dark were similar to those obtained in bulbs cured in the light. The treatments chopping followed by refrigerated storage, oven roasting and frying, did practically not contribute to modify the total levels of flavonols. Moderate microwave cooking did not affect to the flavonol content, but intense microwave treatment cause flavonol losses of 16% and 18% for quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside (QdG) and quercetin 4'-glucoside (QmG), respectively. Boiling onions for 30 min leaded losses of quercetin glycosides, which leached to the boiling water without being degraded at 37% and 29% for QdG and QmG, respectively. Boiling for 60 min had more severe effects, since it caused the degradation of quercetin derivatives at 53% and 44% for QdG and QmG, respectively.

"Antioxidant activity of ethanolic extracts from several asparagus cultivars","15969499.0","Three different methods (antiradical activity, inhibition of primary oxidation, and ferric reducing power) have been used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of eight different asparagus cultivars and byproducts: white and green asparagus from Alcalá del Río (Guadalquivir Valley, Seville) and American hybrids, native spears, and their byproducts from Huétor-Tájar (Vega de Granada). The correlation between antioxidant activity and total phenol content was studied. Six standards were also tested to validate the modified methods for antioxidant activity determination. Results obtained for antiradical capacity and reducing power were very similar, and a high correlation with phenols was found (R > or = 0.9 for both tests). Sample origin was an important factor, spears from Huétor-Tájar having higher values (ARC between 7 and 10 and P(R) of 0.25-0.33) than those from Alcalá del Río (ARC 0.6-2 and P(R) of 0.05-0.07). Significant differences were found between spears with the same origin, suggesting that genetics are another factor to take into account. Asparagus inhibits lipid primary oxidation, but no correlation between the inhibition percentage and phenols was observed. Asparagus origin was the only factor that led to significant differences: samples from Huétor-Tájar had higher values (POIC between 18 and 32) than those from Alcalá del Río (POIC of 5-9). Byproducts from the canning industry at Huétor-Tájar were also assayed for antioxidant activity; the results obtained suggested that byproducts could be considered as an excellent source of natural antioxidants.","982.0"

The detection limits in real samples were 0.02 and 0.003 mg/l for absorbance and fluorescence detection, respectively. We compared the results obtained by means of both detectors, for 58 red wines from different denominations of origin, and no significant differences were observed, either between methods or among the denominations of origin. The mean level found in bottled red wines was 2.89 mg/l.","984.0"
"Principal component analysis of the polyphenol content in young red wines","","Pea protein is increasingly used as a plant-based alternative for fining white wines, aiming to reduce excessive polyphenols while replacing animal-derived or synthetic agents such as PVPP. This study compared pea protein alone (P), PVPP (PV), and untreated control wines (V0) with five combinations containing pea protein and additional agents, such as activated carbon (C), bentonite (B), yeast hulls (Y), and fungal chitosan (K), forming the variants PCB, PYB, PCY, PKY, and PKC applied in doses of 20 g/hL. Fining was applied to aromatic white wines of <i>Tămâioasa Românească</i> in triplicate (50 L tanks), obtained and followed by standard vinification steps. Main wine parameters (ethanol, malic acid, acetic acid, pH) were largely unaffected by the treatments, while free sugar levels showed only slight variations. Some significant differences were observed in total acidity. Total polyphenol content was significantly reduced by ternary fining combinations containing pea protein and yeast extract (PCY and PKY), as well as by PVPP, with reductions of approximately 37% compared to the control. Proanthocyanidins were largely preserved irrespective of the treatment, whereas flavan-3,4-diols were significantly reduced by PVPP. The fining treatments induced only small, imperceptible differences in colour, detectable solely through CIELab measurements, with the classical PVPP treatment producing wines with wines with the greenest colour tones. Volatile profiles, assessed using a GC analyser with two columns (Heracles electronic nose), were analysed in detail. Of all the 8 experimental variants, chitosan- and yeast hull-containing combinations (PKY and PCY) enhanced both varietal and fermentation-derived aromas, particularly terpenes and key esters, producing the most expressive and complex wines. In these variants, compared to control wines, eucalyptol, linalool, and <i>trans</i>-linalool oxide increased approximately by 13.1-23.2%, 16.7-19.3% and 341.5-428.7%, respectively. Pea protein alone preserved the aroma profile closest to the untreated control, inducing no significant differences in all the compound classes, making it a suitable alternative to PVPP. In contrast, bentonite-containing treatments reduced ester and terpene concentrations, simplifying the aroma profile and diminishing varietal characteristics. In bentonite variants, especially PCB, reduced key aroma compounds such as 2-phenylethyl acetate by 17.9%, ethyl octanoate by 12.9% and ethyl decanoate by 33.0%, linalool and <i>trans</i>-linalool oxide, by 18.5%, and 22.7%, respectively. These results support the use of pea protein as a selective and minimally disruptive fining agent, suitable for reducing polyphenol content while preserving wine quality. Pea protein combinations with yeast hulls, and to some extent with chitosan or other fining agents, can further enhance aroma complexity and varietal expression.","985.0"
"Polyphenolic content in five Tuscany cultivars of Olea europaea L","10552399.0","In this study polyphenolic compounds extracted from olive fruits of five registered cultivars were analyzed. A solid-liquid extraction (LSE) procedure with Extrelut cartridge (diatomaceous earth) using different eluents was developed to obtain polyphenolic compounds. HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods were applied for the quali-quantitative analysis of each fraction obtained from LSE. The results of this work show that the LSE procedure with diatomaceous earth cartridge supplies a rapid and reproducible fractioning method able to obtain a quantitative recovery of all compounds and to collect fractions directly analyzed by HPLC. A comparison among different cultivars shows significant quantitative differences in some polyphenols, such as verbascoside, anthocyanic compounds, and oleuropein derivatives.","986.0"
"Polyphenols in greenhouse and open-air-grown lettuce","","The fungal genus <i>Trichoderma</i> is highly valued in agriculture for its versatile roles, mainly as a biocontrol agent against plant pathogens. Recently, its use as a natural biofertilizer has gained attention, as <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. promotes crop growth and improves yield by enhancing the rhizosphere environment and activating plant defences. Globally, over 250 <i>Trichoderma</i>-based products dominate 60-90% of the market, but their efficacy can decline during transportation and storage. Additionally, concerns about their impact on native soil biodiversity have led to interest in using locally adapted, native strains. The novel native strain of <i>Trichoderma</i> sp. STP8 (formerly <i>T. koningiopsis</i> agg. STP8) previously showed strong antagonism against <i>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</i> and promoted lettuce growth in greenhouse conditions. This study evaluated <i>Trichoderma</i> sp. STP8's effectiveness in field-grown lettuce, revealing yield increases of 16.6% to 30.5%. The most significant gains occurred when <i>Trichoderma</i> sp. STP8 was applied before head formation, 26 days after planting. That was in one treatment with two applications (at seedling planting and after 26 days) and another with three applications (at sowing, at seedling planting, and after 26 days). These results demonstrate <i>Trichoderma</i> sp. STP8's potential as a sustainable biocontrol and biofertilizer agent for lettuce, encouraging further research across different agricultural systems, including hydroponics and soil-less medium.","987.0"

Flavonols, isoflavones, and anthocyanins have been separated and determined in the different samples chosen on the basis of their seed coat color. A flavonol that has not been previously found in Phaseolus vulgaris L. seeds has been characterized. The quantitative data show the presence of flavonols (ranging from 709 to 118 mg/kg of fresh weight), isoflavones (ranging from 14 to 2 mg/kg of fresh weight), and anthocyanins, in black beans only. These results show that this genotype could be very interesting from a nutritional point of view.","988.0"
"Characterization of Violetto di Toscana, a typical Italian variety of artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.)","","This work regards the characterization of the phenolic compounds and the mineral composition of the variety Violetto di Toscana, which is typically cultivated in Tuscany for the flavour of its edible part. All the results achieved are compared with those of var. Terom, which is widely used in Italy. A systematic study was performed on the different plant parts: the edible head and leaves, outer bracts and stems. The data for the whole plant showed that the polyphenol content of var. Violetto exceeds that of var. Terom by about 25%, so this variety could be regarded as a functional food and also as an interesting source of antioxidant phenolic compounds. A decoction of bracts and leaves was also carried out in order to evaluate the amount of polyphenols which may be extracted by a simple hot water extraction.","989.0"

"Hydroxytyrosol 4-b-D-glucoside, an important phenolic compound in olive fruits and derived products","12059168.0","There is increasing interest in olive polyphenols because of their biological properties as well as their contribution to the color, taste, and shelf life of olive products. However, some of these compounds remain unidentified. It has been shown that hydroxytyrosol 4-beta-D-glucoside (4-beta-D-glucosyl-3-hydroxyphenylethanol) coeluted with hydroxytyrosol [(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol] under reversed phase conditions in the phenolic chromatograms of olive pulp, vegetation water, and pomace of olive oil processing. A method to separate this compound from hydroxytyrosol by HPLC has been developed. The concentration of this glucoside increased in olive pulp with maturation and could be the main phenolic compound in mature olives. In contrast, the presence of this compound was not detected in olive oil by using HPLC-MS. The compound must be considered both in table olives and olive oil processing because of its glucose and hydroxytyrosol contribution to these products.","991.0"

Here, the levels of these compounds in Spanish white and rose wines are described. For white wines, a concentration step was needed to quantify the four resveratrol isomers. The recovery and reproducibility of this procedure were very good. These white wines had levels between 0.051 and 1.801 mg/L.

"Piceid, the major resveratrol derivative in grape juices","10564012.0","The levels of trans-piceid, cis-piceid, trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol have been measured in 36 grape juices using an HPLC system with spectral analysis of eluting peaks. The piceid (glucosides) were the major component in the grape juices. In red grape juices the average concentrations were 3.38 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.79 mg/L for cis-piceid, 0.50 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and 0.06 mg/L for cis-resveratrol. In white grape juices the levels were, on average, 0.18 mg/L for trans-piceid, 0.26 mg/L for cis-piceid, and 0.05 mg/L for trans-resveratrol, and cis-resveratrol was not detected in any sample. Levels of total resveratrol (trans- and cis-resveratrol and -piceid) found in red and in white grape juices are similar to those described in Spanish red and white wines. Due to their resveratrol content, as well as other phenolics, grape juices may have a beneficial health effect of interest to those who cannot drink wine.","993.0"
"Ellagic acid content of red raspberry juice as influenced by cultivar, processing, and environmental factors","","Ellagic acid and its derivatives present in pilot-plant-processed raspberry juices and commercial juice concentrates were characterized and concentrations estimated using HPLC/diode array spectral techniques. Experimental juice samples (n = 45) contained a mean concentration of 10 ppm of ellagic acid and less than or equal to 16 derivatives of ellagic acid with individual mean concentrations of up to 3 ppm. Commercial juices (n = 7) contained more ellagic acid and derivatives than experimental juices, with a mean concentration of 30 ppm of ellagic acid and up to 6.7 ppm for individual ellagic acid derivatives. The mean total concentration of ellagic acid and its derivatives in experimental juices was 28 ppm and in commercial juices 52 ppm. Qualitatively, the chromatographic profiles were very similar for the juices studied, but quantitatively, there were great differences due to cultivar (n = 10) and processing method. Williamette and Meeker cultivars contained the most ellagic acid and its forms. Juices made by diffusion extraction and a standard process had by far the highest concentrations of ellagic acid and its forms. High-speed centrifugation reduced total ellagic acid forms by half compared to diffusion extraction; depectinization and concentration decreased total forms even further.","994.0"
"Composition of flavonols in red raspberry juice as inflenced by cultivar, processing, and environmental factors","","Flavonols were characterized and measured in experimental (n = 46) and commercial (n = 9) red raspberry juices by HPLC/diode array spectral techniques. Samples were prepared using minicolumns, packed with Polyamide 6. A fraction eluted with methanol contained eight or fewer quercetin glycosides, quercetin, and kaempferol. A second fraction eluted subsequently with 0.5% ammonia in methanol contained three flavonol glucuronides, two flavonol forms, aglycons, ellagic acid, and its derivatives. Quercetin 3-glucuronide was the major flavonol in experimental and commercial juices, respectively (mean of 54 and 51 ppm), and a flavonol presumed to be quercetin 3-sophoroside was the second primary compound means of 29 and 33 ppm). In addition, 36 flavonol forms were measured in trace amounts.

"Sulfated ferulic acid is the main in vivo metabolite found after short-term ingestion of free ferulic acid in rats","11982438.0","The bioavailability of ferulic acid (FA; 3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) and its metabolites was investigated in rat plasma and urine after an oral short-term ingestion of 5.15 mg/kg of FA. Free FA, glucuronoconjugates, and sulfoconjugates were quickly detected in plasma with a peak of concentration found 30 min after ingestion. Sulfoconjugates were the main derivates ( approximately 50%). In urine, the cumulative excretion of total metabolites reached a plateau 1.5 h after ingestion, and approximately 40% were excreted by this way. Free FA recovered in urine represented only 4.9 +/-1.5% of the native FA consumed by rats. Glucuronoconjugates and sulfoconjugates represented 0.5 +/- 0.3 and 32.7 +/- 7.3%, respectively. These results suggested that a part of FA incorporated in the diet was quickly absorbed and largely metabolized in sulfoconjugates before excretion in urine.","996.0"

The orange juice contained 168 micromol of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside and 18 micromol of naringenin-7-O-rutinoside. GC-MS analysis of the urine identified nine phenolic acids, five of which, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid, dihydroferulic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylhydracrylic acid and 3-hydroxyhippuric acid, were associated with orange juice consumption indicating that they were derived from colonic catabolism of hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside. The overall 0-24 h excretion of the five phenolic acids was 6.7 +/- 1.8 micromol after drinking water and this increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 62 +/- 18 micromol, equivalent to 37% of the ingested flavanones, following orange juice consumption. When the orange juice was ingested with yoghurt excretion fell back markedly to 9.3 +/- 4.4 micromol. This was not due to a difference in mouth to caecum transit time, as measured with breath hydrogen production, though possibly there may have been a slowing of the bulk of the meal reaching the large intestine which may then have altered the catabolism of the flavanones to phenolic acids by the colonic microbiota.","998.0"
"Green tea flavan-3-ols: colonic degradation and urinary excretion of catabolites by humans","20041649.0","Following the ingestion of green tea, substantial quantities of flavan-3-ols pass from the small to the large intestine (Stalmach et al. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, 53, S44-S53; Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2009, doi: 10.1002/mnfr.200900194). To investigate the fate of the flavan-3-ols entering the large intestine, where they are subjected to the action of the colonic microflora, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate were incubated in vitro with fecal slurries and the production of phenolic acid catabolites was determined by GC-MS. In addition, urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites was investigated over a 24 h period after ingestion of either green tea or water by healthy volunteers with a functioning colon. The green tea was also fed to ileostomists, and 0-24 h urinary excretion of phenolic acid catabolites was monitored. Pathways are proposed for the degradation of green tea flavan-3-ols in the colon and further catabolism of phenolic compounds passing into the circulatory system from the large intestine, prior to urinary excretion in quantities corresponding to ca. 40% of intake compared with ca. 8% absorption of flavan-3-ol methyl, glucuronide, and sulfate metabolites in the small intestine.

"Structure-Antioxidant Efficiency Relationships of Phenolic Compounds and Their Contribution to the Antioxidant Activity of Sea Buckthorn Juice","12848490.0","The phenolic composition of juice derived from fruits of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array and electrochemical detection. Flavonols were found to be the predominating polyphenols while phenolic acids and catechins represent minor components. Of the seven flavonols identified, isorhamnetin 3-O-glycosides were the most important representatives quantitatively. However, because of their structural properties, they were poor radical scavengers as shown by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. Phenolic compounds such as quercetin 3-O-glycosides, catechins, and hydroxybenzoic acids with a catechol structure exhibited good antioxidant capacities, but their concentration in sea buckthorn juice was small. These phenolic compounds, determined by HPLC, accounted for less than 5% of the total antioxidant activity of the filtered juice. Ascorbic acid was shown to be the major antioxidant in sea buckthorn juice. Because of its high concentration of 1.22 g/L, it contributes approximately 75% to total antioxidant activity. The remaining difference can be attributed to higher molecular weight flavan-3-ols (proanthocyanidins), which were determined photometrically after acid depolymerization to colored anthocyanidins.","1000.0"

"Gas chromatographic analysis of alkylresorcinols in rye (Secale cereale L) grains","","A method was established for fast and easy analysis of 5-n-alkylresorcinols in rye grains, considering effects of milling (intact grains versus flour), extraction solvent (ethyl acetate, methanol and acetone), extraction volume per gram of sample (20 and 40 ml) and extraction time (3, 6, 18 and 24 h). For intact kernels, extraction of 1 g samples with ethyl acetate (40 ml, 24 h) is recommended. The ease of extraction is consistent with the presence of alkylresorcinols in the outer layers of the kernel and their absence in the endosperm. The extracts were analysed (without further purification or derivatisation) by gas chromatography using methyl behenate (C22:0, fatty acid methyl ester) as internal standard. Alkylresorcinols were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and the major homologues were found to contain alkyl chains of C17:0, C19:0, C21:0, C23:0 and C25:0. The methodology was then applied to analyse the alkylresorcinol content in 15 rye cultivars grown at two locations in Sweden.

One durum wheat variety was found to have an exceptionally low level of ARs (54 microgram/g) compared to other durum wheat varieties (589-751 microgram/g) and Triticumspecies analyzed. The AR content of milling fractions closely followed the ash content and could be used as a marker of the presence of bran in flour. Using hot 1-propanol extraction, all ARs could be extracted from bread, contrary to previous studies which suggested that ARs were destroyed during baking. Cereal products varied greatly in AR content, with those containing wheat bran or whole rye having the highest content.","1003.0"
"Red chicories as potent scavengers of highly reactive radicals: a study on their phenolic composition and peroxyl radical trapping capacity and efficiency","16218660.0","Eight varieties of Cichorium genus vegetables (five heavily red colored, one red spotted, and two fully green) were investigated for their phenolic content (by HPLC and UV-vis spectrophotometry) and for their antioxidant activity. In particular, the capacity (that is, the amount of trapped peroxyl radicals) and the efficiency (that is, the amount of antioxidant necessary to halve the steady-state concentration of peroxyl radicals) were measured. All of the studied chicories are characterized by the presence of a large amount of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids, whereas the red color is due to cyanidin glycosides. The presence of these phenolics in red chicories confers to them an exceptionally high peroxyl radical scavenging activity in terms of both capacity and efficiency, particularly in their early stage of growth, and makes this popular and low-cost foods comparable or superior to many foods having well-known antioxidant properties such as red wine, blueberry, and tomato.","1004.0"
"The phenolic composition of South African Pinotage, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon wines","","Astringency is often difficult to evaluate accurately in wine because of its complexity. This accuracy can improve through training sessions, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. A way to reduce these costs can be the use of wine experts, who are known to be reliable evaluators. Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare the sensory results and the panel performance obtained using trained panelists versus wine experts (winemakers). Judges evaluated twelve red wines for in-mouth basic perception (sweet, sour, bitter, astringent, and burning sensation) following the same tasting protocol and with the samples being presented in two different tasting modalities. Panels' performance and relationship between the chemical composition and the sensory perception were investigated. Both panels showed similar consistency and repeatability, and they were able to accurately measure the astringency of the wines. However, the significant correlations between sensory scores and chemical composition varied with the panel and the tasting modality. From our results, we could see that winemakers tended to discriminate better between the samples when the differences were very small.","1005.0"

"Quantitation of polymethoxylated flavones in orange juice by high-performance liquid chromatography","546912.0","A quantitative high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedure for the determination of the five major polymethoxylated flavones (PMFs) in orange juice has been developed. It employs a unique ternary solvent system with coupled UV-fluorescence detection. The dual detectors were employed to determine the presence of interfering substances and served as a cross check on quantitation. Stop flow UV and fluorescence scanning was used to identify peaks and determine the presence of impurities. Although all five citrus PMFs fluoresce, some HPLC fluorescence peaks were too small to be of much practical use. All five citrus PMFs could be quantitated satisfactorily with the fixed wavelength UV (313 nm) detector. The HPLC procedure has been used to evaluate each step in the preparation. The optimum extracting solvent was selected and one time consuming step was eliminated, as it was found to be unnecessary. HPLC values for nobiletin and sinensetin are in good agreement with the thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) values in the literature. HPLC values for the other three flavones were considerably lower than those reported in the literature.

"Quantitative analysis of narirutin, naringin, hesperidin, and neohesperidin in Citrus","","The extraction of active aromatic components from tangerine peel is a key challenge due to the limitations of traditional methods in terms of yield, selectivity, and efficiency. This study presents a novel approach using highly branched mesoporous SiO<sub>2</sub> (HB-MSN) with a large pore structure to selectively adsorb multiple aromatic compounds in tangerine peel. HB-MSN with adjustable pore sizes and high surface area can offer distinct advantages over traditional SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, particularly for the adsorption of complex molecules in a natural matrix. Herein, the chromatographic method was developed for efficient separation and corresponding qualitative detection of six key aromatic compounds in tangerine peel. Meanwhile, the adsorption mechanisms and models were used to investigate the interaction between HB-MSN and such six aromatic components, focusing on the influence of heat-driven effect on the efficiency of the adsorption. Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses demonstrated that thermal energy not only accelerates the movement of aromatic compounds in solution, facilitating their diffusion toward the surface of HB-MSN through local concentration gradients but also enhances the adsorption effect by promoting mass transfer within the adsorbent particles. Therefore, the thermally driven acceleration effect is the mainly adsorption mechanism of HB-MSN for aromatic compounds in complex systems. This research provides a foundation for the sustainable adsorption and analysis of tangerine peel's bioactive fragrance compounds, with potential applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries.","1009.0"
"Interindividual variation in metabolism of soy isoflavones and lignans: influence of habitual diet on equol production by the gut microflora","10798213.0","The soy isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, and the lignans, matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol, are phytoestrogens metabolized extensively by the intestinal microflora. Considerable important evidence is already available that shows extensive interindividual variation in isoflavone metabolism, and we have investigated the extent of this variation in a crossover study of a soy-containing food low or high in isoflavones (each treatment period lasted for 17 days, and the 2 treatment periods were separated by a 25-day washout period) in 24 healthy subjects [19 women and 5 men, mean age 30 yr, range 19-40, mean body mass index 22.5 +/- 3.5 (SD) kg/m2]. There was a 16-fold variation in total isoflavonoid excretion in urine after the high-isoflavone treatment period. The variation in urinary equol excretion was greatest (664-fold), and subjects fell into two groups: poor equol excretors and good equol excretors (36%). A significant negative correlation was found between the proportion of energy from fat in the habitual diet and urinary equol excretion (r = -0.55; p = 0.012). Good equol excretors consumed less fat as percentage of energy than poor excretors (26 +/- 2.3% compared with 35 +/- 1.6%, p < 0.01) and more carbohydrate as percentage of energy than poor excretors (55 +/- 2.9% compared with 47 +/- 1.7%, p < 0.05). Interindividual variation in the urinary excretion of O-desmethyl-angolensin (O-DMA) was also apparent (76-fold after the high-isoflavone treatment period), but there was no relationship between equol excretion and O-DMA excretion. Enterolactone was the major lignan metabolite in urine and plasma but showed less interindividual variation than equol and O-DMA. It is suggested that the dietary fat intake decreases the capacity of gut microbial flora to synthesize equol.","1010.0"

The fraction varied considerably in gross chemical composition; the starch content ranged from 3(.)0 g/100 g dm in the pericarp/testa to 78(.)2 g/100 g dm in the endosperm, and the content of dietary fibre (DF) from 6(.)5 g/100 g dm in the endosperm to 73(.)3 g/100 g dm in the pericarp/testa. Protein, fat, ash and phosphorous were concentrated in the aleurone fraction. DF characteristics also differed largely between the rye milling fractions. Arabinoxylans (AX) comprised the majority of DF components in all samples, but on DF basis the milling fractions had different concentrations of lignin, cellulose and beta-glucans. Moreover, a wide range in arabinose to xylose ratio of the water-unextractable AX (0(.)35-1(.)02) and in the proportion of water-extractable AX (14-70% of total AX) implied that variation in AX structure was obtained. Rye breads intended for a nutritional study were made from the milling fractions. It is concluded that the breads can be used to study the influence of DF characteristics on the colonic fermentation processes in monogastrics.","1014.0"

"Structural determinants of plant lignans for the formation of enterolactone in vivo","12270222.0","The quantity of mammalian lignans enterolactone (ENL) and enterodiol (END) and of plant lignans secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) excreted in a 24-h rat urine sample was measured after a single p.o. dose of an equivalent quantity of secoisolariciresinol diglycoside (SDG), secoisolariciresinol (SECO), matairesinol (MR), 7-hydroxymatairesinol (HMR) and ENL. Plant lignans (SECO and HMR) were partially absorbed as such. The aglycone form of SECO was more efficiently converted into mammalian lignans END and ENL than the glycosylated form, SDG. Of plant lignans, MR produced the highest quantities of ENL: the quantity was over twofold compared with HMR or SDG. The majority of the animals, which had been given SECO, excreted higher quantities of END than ENL into urine, but ENL was the main lignan metabolite after SDG. The highest quantities of ENL in urine were measured after the administration of ENL as such. The (-)SECO isolated from Araucaria angustifolia was converted into (-)ENL only. The administration of (-)SDG, which was shown to produce (+)SECO, resulted in excretion of (+)ENL only and (-)HMR was converted into (-)ENL only. This confirmed that the absolute configurations at C8 and C8' are not changed during the microbial metabolism. Whether the biological effects are enantiomer-specific, remains to be resolved.","1016.0"
"Investigation of the antioxidant properties of tomatoes after processing","","A study was made of the antioxidant content, activity and colour of two New Zealand commercially grown tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum L. var. Excell and Aranca) cultivated in glasshouses using hydroponic techniques. Excell tomatoes were harvested and stored individually while cultivar Aranca was harvested by cutting the vine, which consisted of a group of eight tomatoes. Both cultivars of tomatoes were stored in the dark for 4 days at 15°C to simulate normal pre-purchase storing conditions. The antioxidant content of the raw tomatoes after 4 days of storage were markedly different while the CIE LAB colour values of the cut inner surfaces of the two cultivars were similar. After 4 days storage, subsamples of each cultivar were either boiled, baked or fried, and analysis of CIE colour, ascorbic acid, total phenolics, lycopene and antioxidant activity (using the ABTS assay) was undertaken. Boiling and baking had a relatively small effect on the ascorbic, total phenolic, lycopene and antioxidant activity of the two cultivars while frying significantly reduced (P<0.001) the ascorbic, total phenolic and lycopene contents of the two cultivars. Chromatic colour analysis showed that both cultivars became significantly (P<0.001) darker and less red after cooking by all methods. In a following experiment, the two cultivars of tomatoes were sliced and allowed to soak for 20 min in a mixture of olive oil and white vinegar, or olive oil and white vinegar separately. CIE colour of the two cultivars showed no change after processing but the treatments of oil and vinegar separately and together reduced (P<0.05) the red component of the colour. Treating the two cultivars of tomatoes with the oil and vinegar mixture resulted in a significant reduction (P<0.001) in the ascorbic acid, total phenolic and antioxidant activity of the tomatoes. Treatment with oil significantly reduced the amount of lycopene that could be extracted from the tomatoes while treatment with vinegar had no effect.","1017.0"
"The phenolic acids in wheat 1. Changes during growth and development","","<h4>Main conclusion</h4>Germination is a developmental stage in which plants accumulate higher levels of bioactive metabolites. However, this potential remains largely unexplored in medicinal herbs and therapeutic applications. Sprouting represents a brief yet metabolically dynamic phase in plant development, during which dormant seeds initiate enzymatic activation and begin synthesizing a range of bioactive compounds. Compared to dry seeds or mature plants, sprouts often contain higher levels of phenolics, flavonoids, vitamins, and other secondary metabolites, enhancing their nutritional and pharmacological value. While edible sprouts from food crops have been extensively studied, sprouts derived from medicinal plants remain largely overlooked. This is surprising given their natural richness in pharmacologically relevant phytochemicals. This perspective draws primarily on original experimental studies that investigated phytochemical and physiological changes during sprouting of medicinal plants. These studies were identified through searches in scientific databases using keywords related to medicinal plants, sprouts, and bioactive compounds. We summarize existing studies on species such as Trigonella foenum-graecum, Nigella sativa, Silybum marianum, Arctium lappa, Trifolium pratense, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and identify other promising candidates with high germination potential but uncharacterized phytochemical profiles at the sprout stage. Environmental variables, such as light quality, seed priming, or nutrient supplementation, can further modulate phytochemical composition during germination. We also discuss practical limitations, including low biomass yield, microbial safety concerns, and lack of standardized protocols. Overall, sprouts offer a responsive, scalable, and experimentally tractable model for exploring and optimizing phytochemical expression in medicinal plants. We propose that this early developmental window offers overlooked opportunities for phytopharmacology, functional foods, and natural product discovery.","1018.0"
"Pharmacokinetics in mice and growth-inhibitory properties of the putative cancer chemopreventive agent resveratrol and the synthetic analogue trans 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene","14760392.0","Resveratrol (trans-3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a naturally occurring polyphenol with cancer chemopreventive properties in preclinical models of carcinogenesis, including those of colorectal cancer. Recently, a variety of analogues of resveratrol have been synthesised and investigated in in vitro assays. One analogue, 3,4,5,4'-tetramethoxystilbene (DMU 212), showed preferential growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic properties in transformed cells, when compared with their untransformed counterparts. As part of a chemoprevention drug development programme, the pharmacokinetic properties of DMU 212 were compared with those of resveratrol in the plasma, liver, kidney, lung, heart, brain and small intestinal and colonic mucosa of mice. DMU 212 or resveratrol (240 mg kg(-1)) were administered intragastrically, and drug concentrations were measured by HPLC. Metabolites were characterised by cochromatography with authentic reference compounds and were identified by mass spectrometry. The ratios of area of plasma or tissue concentration vs time curves of resveratrol over DMU 212 (AUC(res)/AUC(DMU212)) for the plasma, liver, small intestinal and colonic mucosa were 3.5, 5, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. Thus, resveratrol afforded significantly higher levels than DMU 212 in the plasma and liver, while DMU 212 exhibited superior availability compared to resveratrol in the small intestine and colon. Resveratrol was metabolised to its sulphate or glucuronate conjugates, while DMU 212 underwent metabolic hydroxylation or single and double O-demethylation. DMU 212 and resveratrol inhibited the growth of human-derived colon cancer cells HCA-7 and HT-29 in vitro with IC(50) values of between 6 and 26 microM. In the light of the superior levels achieved in the gastrointestinal tract after the administration of DMU 212, when compared to resveratrol, the results provide a good rationale to evaluate DMU 212 as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.","1019.0"

"Anthocyanin composition in black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties grown in Mexico","","Five common bean varieties were cooked and studied regarding starch digestibility. Cooking time of different cultivars ranged between 2.55 and 5.92 h. Available starch (AS) values decreased with the storage time and the bean sample that had the lowest AS content (control sample, without storage) showed the shortest cooking time. A similar pattern was found for resistant starch (RS); the varieties that had the longest cooking time presented the widest range in RS values, measured as the difference between the control sample and the value obtained in the sample stored during 96 h. The retrograded RS (RRS) depended on the variety and even more on the molecular structure of each starch. The in vitro -amylolysis rate decreased with the storage time; the samples with the smallest hydrolysis percentage had the highest RS content. These results suggest that some bean varieties could be recommended depending on the specific dietetic use of beans.","1021.0"

"Human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols analyzed by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition","18433082.0","Tea is rich in polyphenols and has a variety of biological activities. In order to better understand the biological effects of tea constituents on human health, markers for their exposure and their metabolic fates are needed. Previously, we have characterized several catechin metabolites in the blood and urine, but more information on the metabolite profile of tea polyphenols is needed. In the present study, the human urinary metabolite profile of tea polyphenols was investigated using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with data-dependent acquisition. With data-dependent MS/MS analysis by collecting the MS2 and MS3 spectra of the most intense ions in the sample, we identified more than twenty metabolites of tea polyphenols from human urine samples. (-)-Epigallocatechin (EGC) glucuronide, methylated EGC glucuronide, methylated EGC sulfate, (-)-epicatechin (EC) glucruronide, EC sulfate, methylated EC sulfate, as well as the glucuronide and sulfate metabolites of the ring-fission metabolites of tea catechins, 5-(3',4',5'-trihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M4), 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6) and 5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone (M6'), were the major human urinary metabolites of tea polyphenols.

"Effects of food processing on blueberry antiproliferation and antioxidant activity","","Cultivated highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and wild lowbush (Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) blueberries are excellent sources of phytochemicals that are believed to have significant biological activity. The objective of this study was to determine whether incorporation of blueberries into food products affects their phenolic content or antioxidant and antiproliferation activity. Several blueberry fruit-containing products including fresh, individually quick frozen (IQF), freeze-dried, spray-dried, heat-dried, cooked, juice concentrate, pie filling, and jam were fractionated to remove sugars and isolate groups of phytochemicals based on solubility. The fractions were analyzed for total phenolics and assayed for ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) antioxidant activity, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, and hepa-1c1c7 antiproliferative activities. For both cultivated and wild berries, fresh and IQF berries had the highest total phenols, antioxidant activity, and antiproliferation activity. Whole freeze-dried wild blueberries also retained significant antiproliferative activity in 2 fractions eluted with acetone (fraction 4, 4% of control cell growth at 20 microgram/mL) and 50% aqueous acetone (fraction 5, 69% of control cell growth at 20 microgram/mL) and ranked close to the activities recorded for fresh (30% of control cell growth at 20 microgram/mL for fraction 5) and IQF whole fruit (27% of control cell growth at 20 microgram/mL for fraction 5). Products that were heat-processed retained most of the antioxidant activity and total phenolics found in unprocessed whole fruit. However, the heat-treated products lacked or had diminished antiproliferation activity, suggesting that although products may be high in phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, some forms of bioactivity may be compromised by harsh processing methods.","1034.0"
"Determination of chlorogenic acids with lactones in coffee","","An HPLC method has been developed which allowed the determination of mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acids (CQA and di-CQA), corresponding lactones (CQL) and feruloylquinic acids (FQA) in roasted coffee within one chromatographic run. The elusion order was verified by isolation of the individual compounds by preparative HPLC, chromatography of the fractions on the analytical HPLC system, NMR spectroscopy and thermospray LC-MS. At least 15 additional minor compounds had the spectra of hydroxycinnamic acids, some of them only occurring in roasted coffee. Caffeoyltryptophan, which has been identified some time ago by another working group could also be separated with this system. The average contents in commercial roasted coffee samples (n = 12) were: 3-CQA, 5.0 g kg-1; 4-CQA, 6.2 g kg-1; 5-CQA, 11.4 g kg-1; 4-FQA, 0.7 g kg-1; 5-FQA, 1.4 g kg-1; 3-CQL, 21 g kg-1; 4-CQL, 10 g kg-1; 3,4-diCQA, 0.7 g kg-1; 3,5-di-CQA, 0.4 g kg-1 and 4,5-di-CQA, 0.8 g kg-1 dry matter. There were only small differences between the different brands. Two series of samples with different degrees of roast produced from the same green coffee have also been analysed. One series was steam treated before roasting (a process which is commercially used to improve digestibility). Only in the initial stages of roasting (light roast) could a difference in the contents of the acids between both series be observed. Keeping coffee brews at an elevated temperature (4 h at 80 degrees C) reduced the amounts of CQL to 60% of the initial value. The contents of 3-CQA and 4-CQA increased, whilst that of 5-CQA decreased. The overall contents of CQA decreased.","1035.0"

"Comparison of sample preparation methods for analysis of isoflavones in foodstuffs","19166724.0","Due to the lack of one universally applicable and commonly used reference method, sample preparation in isoflavone (IF) analysis has been performed by many different methods which renders comparison and quality assessment of published IF contents in foodstuffs difficult. In the present work, the impact of different experimental parameters on the IF concentrations determined in soybeans, tofu, soy drink and textured vegetable protein by different extraction and hydrolysis methods was assessed and IF contents obtained by optimized orthogonal methods were compared. Chromatographic analysis was performed by HPLC-UV-ESI-MS. If possible sources of error - which are also pointed out in this work - are avoided, IF contents obtained by extraction, acid-, base- and enzymatic hydrolysis are similar. However, these sample preparation methods differ in the amount of time, standard compounds and instruments required, ruggedness, and in their applicability to analysis of complex composite samples containing soy as minor ingredient. Enzymatic hydrolysis with Helix pomatia juice after extraction by sonication with first 50, then 80% aqueous acetonitrile in the presence of zinc sulfate heptahydrate and after adjustment to </=10% organic solvent turned out to be the method of choice if only aglucone equivalent contents are required. The advantages of this method are short chromatographic run times, smallest danger of coelution, lowest achievable limits of quantitation and therefore best suitability for work-up of complex composite samples and that only aglucone standards are needed for quantitation.","1038.0"
"Vitisin A content in Chilean wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and contribution to the color of aged red wines","14518953.0","Vitisin A was prepared from malvidin 3-glucoside and pyruvic acid in model wine medium, isolated by countercurrent chromatography, and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The synthesized compound was used as a reference standard to quantify vitisin A in Chilean wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, including a vertical row of wines from the same vineyard over 16 years. Maximum vitisin A content was reached within the first year of storage. Importantly, up to half of the initial amount of vitisin A in young wines was still present in 15 year old wines. Although vitisin A was found to be much more stable as compared to other monomeric C-4 underivatized anthocyanins, it also slowly degrades after reaching its peak concentration. The ""color activity concept"" was applied to vitisin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, malvidin 3-(6' '-acetylglucoside), and polymeric pigments isolated by countercurrent chromatography in order to estimate their contribution toward the overall color expression of wines. It was found that vitisin A is only a minor contributor to the visually perceived color of aged red wines (color contribution approximately 5%). The major contributor is the polymeric fraction (color contribution approximately 70-90%).","1039.0"
"Investigations on anthocyanins in wines from Vitis vinifera cv. Pinotage: factors influencing the formation of pinotin A and its correlation with wine age","14759139.0","Pinotage red wines were found to contain a reaction product of malvidin 3-glucoside and caffeic acid, the so-called pinotin A. A total of 50 Pinotage wines from the vintages 1996-2002 were analyzed for the content of pinotin A, malvidin 3-glucoside, caffeic acid, and caftaric acid. Statistical analyses were performed to reveal variations in the content of these compounds and to determine the factors that influence pinotin A formation during wine aging. An exponential increase of the concentration of this aging product was observed with prolonged storage time. The most rapid synthesis of pinotin A was observed in 2.5-4 year old wines, although at this age malvidin 3-glucoside is already degraded to a large extent. This phenomenon is explained by the increased ratio of caffeic acid/malvidin 3-glucoside, which strongly favors the formation of pinotin A and makes side reactions less likely. Pinotin A formation proceeds as long as a certain level of malvidin 3-glucoside is maintained in the wines. In wines >5-6 years old degradation or polymerization of pinotin A finally exceeds the rate of its de novo synthesis.","1040.0"

"Pistachio skin phenolics are destroyed by bleaching resulting in reduced antioxidative capacities","16968060.0","Pistachio shells split naturally prior to maturity leading to their unique crack-shell form. Within 24 h of harvest, hull-trapped moisture may cause shell staining. The illegal process of bleaching has been used to restore a desirable white color to pistachio shells. It is not known whether bleaching adversely affects phytochemical levels in pistachios. Therefore, we identified for the first time multiple pistachio skin phenolics as quercetin (14.9 microg/g), luteolin (10.0 microg/g), eriodictyol (10.2 microg/g), rutin (1.6 microg/g), naringenin (1.2 microg/g), apigenin (0.2 microg/g), and the anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-galactoside (696 microg/g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (209 microg/g). We investigated the effects of bleaching (0.1-50% hydrogen peroxide) on phenolic levels and antioxidative capacities in raw and roasted nuts. Because of their flavylium cation structures, anthocyanins were the most sensitive to bleaching. Bleaching decreased total anthocyanin levels [mug/g of skins (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 905 and 549 (0%); 653 and 145 (0.1%); 111 and 18.4 (5%); 6.1 and 3.2 (25%); 0 and 0 (50%) for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Bleaching also reduced antioxidative capacity [microM/g of Trolox (% hydrogen peroxide)]: 945 and 725 (0%); 940 and 472 (0.1%); 930 and 455 (5%); 433 and 370 (25%); 189 and 173 (50%), for raw and roasted nuts, respectively. Raw nuts preserved phenolic levels and antioxidant capacity better than roasted nuts, suggesting contributing effects of other substances and/or matrix effects that are destroyed by the roasting process. The destruction of bioactive phenolics in pistachio skins may negatively impact the potential health benefits arising from pistachio consumption.","1042.0"
"Pomegranate juice ellagitannin metabolites are present in human plasma and some persist in urine for up to 48 hours","16988113.0","Ellagitannins (ETs) from pomegranate juice (PJ) are reported to have numerous biological properties, but their absorption and metabolism in humans are poorly understood. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of pomegranate ETs, 18 healthy volunteers were given 180 mL of PJ concentrate, and blood samples were obtained for 6 h afterwards. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were obtained on the day before (-1), the day of (0), and the day after (+1) the study. Ellagic acid (EA) was detected in plasma of all subjects with a maximum concentration of 0.06 +/- 0.01 micromol/L, area under concentration time curve of 0.17 +/- 0.02 (micromol x h) x L(-1), time of maximum concentration of 0.98 +/- 0.06 h, and elimination half-life of 0.71 +/- 0.08 h. EA metabolites, including dimethylellagic acid glucuronide (DMEAG) and hydroxy-6H-benzopyran-6-one derivatives (urolithins), were also detected in plasma and urine in conjugated and free forms. DMEAG was found in the urine obtained from 15 of 18 subjects on d 0, but was not detected on d -1 or +1, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker of intake. Urolithin A-glucuronide was found in urine samples from 11 subjects on d 0 and in the urine from 16 subjects on d +1. Urolithin B-glucuronide was found in the urine of 3 subjects on d 0 and in the urine of 5 subjects on d +1. Urolithins, formed by intestinal bacteria, may contribute to the biological effects of PJ as they may persist in plasma and tissues and account for some of the health benefits noted after chronic PJ consumption. Whether genetic polymorphisms in EA-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., catechol-O-methyl transferase and glucuronosyl transferase) are related to variations in response to PJ remains to be established.","1043.0"
"Pomegranate ellagitannin-derived metabolites inhibit prostate cancer growth and localize to the mouse prostate gland","17722872.0","Our group has shown in a phase II clinical trial that pomegranate juice (PJ) increases prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling time in prostate cancer (CaP) patients with a rising PSA. Ellagitannins (ETs) are the most abundant polyphenols present in PJ and contribute greatly towards its reported biological properties. On consumption, ETs hydrolyze to release ellagic acid (EA), which is then converted by gut microflora to 3,8-dihydroxy-6H-dibenzo[b, d]pyran-6-one (urolithin A, UA) derivatives. Despite the accumulating knowledge of ET metabolism in animals and humans, there is no available data on the pharmacokinetics and tissue disposition of urolithins. Using a standardized ET-enriched pomegranate extract (PE), we sought to further define the metabolism and tissue distribution of ET metabolites. PE and UA (synthesized in our laboratory) were administered to C57BL/6 wild-type male mice, and metabolite levels in plasma and tissues were determined over 24 h. ET metabolites were concentrated at higher levels in mouse prostate, colon, and intestinal tissues as compared to other tissues after administration of PE or UA. We also evaluated the effects of PE on CaP growth in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice injected subcutaneously with human CaP cells (LAPC-4). PE significantly inhibited LAPC-4 xenograft growth in SCID mice as compared to vehicle control. Finally, EA and several synthesized urolithins were shown to inhibit the growth of human CaP cells in vitro. The chemopreventive potential of pomegranate ETs and localization of their bioactive metabolites in mouse prostate tissue suggest that pomegranate may play a role in CaP treatment and chemoprevention. This warrants future human tissue bioavailability studies and further clinical studies in men with CaP.","1044.0"
"Pomegranate juice and extracts provide similar levels of plasma and urinary ellagitannin metabolites in human subjects","18598186.0","Pomegranate juice (PJ), a rich source of polyphenols including ellagitannins, has attracted much attention due to its reported health benefits. This has resulted in the consumption of liquid and powder pomegranate extracts as alternatives to PJ. Therefore establishing the bioavailability of polyphenols from these extract preparations is necessary. Sixteen healthy volunteers sequentially consumed, with a 1-week washout period between treatments, PJ (8 ounces, Wonderful fruit variety), a pomegranate polyphenol liquid extract (POMxl, 8 ounces), and a pomegranate polyphenol powder extract (POMxp, 1,000 mg). The three interventions provided 857, 776, and 755 mg of polyphenols as gallic acid equivalents, respectively. Plasma bioavailability, judged based on ellagic acid levels over a 6-hour period, did not show statistical differences in area under the curve for the three interventions: 0.14 +/- 0.05, 0.11 +/- 0.03, and 0.11 +/- 0.04 micromol . hour/L for PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, respectively. The time of maximum concentration was delayed for POMxp (2.58 +/- 0.42 hours) compared to PJ (0.65 +/- 0.23 hours) and POMxl (0.94 +/- 0.06 hours). Urolithin-A glucuronide, a urinary metabolite of ellagic acid, was not significantly different with the three interventions, reaching levels of approximately 1,000 ng/mL. This study demonstrates that ellagitannin metabolites, delivered from pomegranate fruits, as PJ, POMxl, and POMxp, reach equivalent levels with a delay in time of maximum concentration of POMxp compared to PJ and POMxl.","1045.0"
"Effects of laccase, xylanase and their combination on the rheological properties of wheat doughs","","The effects of Trametes hirsuta laccase alone and in combination with Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus subtilis xylanases on dough extensibility were studied using the Kieffer test to determine the dough extensibility (E(x)) and the resistance to stretching (R(max)). Laccase treatment resulted in dough hardening: the R(max) of dough increased and the E(x) at R(max) decreased as a function of dosage (5-50 nkat/g flour). Xylanases softened flour and gluten doughs. Hardening by laccases and softening by xylanases was weaker in gluten doughs. Dough hardening, observed in the laccase treatments, decreased as a function of dough resting time. The softening effect occurred especially at higher laccase dosages (approximately equal to 50 nkat/g flour). The softening phenomenon was related to the laccase-mediated depolymerization of the cross-linked AX network. In combined laccase and xylanase treatments, the effect of laccase was predominant, especially at low xylanase dosage, but when xylanase was added to flour dough at high concentrations, the hardening effect of laccase on dough was decreased. In combined laccase and xylanase treatments in gluten doughs, similar decreases in laccase-mediated hardening were not seen.","1046.0"

Identification of each compound was based on comparison of its retention time and UV spectra with those of pure commercial standards. Three major flavonoids, kaempferol, myricetin, and quercetin, were identified and quantified. Quercetin was the major flavonoid (7.70-46.32 mg/100 g fresh weight, FW) present in all varieties, followed by myricetin (2.77-4.13 mg/100 g FW). Minor quantities of kaempferol (1.10-1.98 mg/100 g FW) were also detected. The total polyphenols and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) ranged from 73.33 to 180.84 mg/100 g FW and 0.92-1.56 microM TEAC/g FW, respectively. A positive but weaker correlation was obtained for total polyphenols versus antioxidant capacity. Nevertheless, a stronger correlation (r(2) = 0.34) was obtained between flavonoid content versus antioxidant capacity.

"Evaluation of phenolic compounds in virgin olive oil by direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection","16608197.0","Hydrophilic phenols are the most abundant natural antioxidants of virgin olive oil (VOO), in which tocopherols and carotenes are also present. The prevalent classes of hydrophilic phenols found in VOO are phenyl alcohols, phenolic acids, secoiridoids such as the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanol or (p-hydroxypheny1)ethanol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA or p-HPEA-EDA) and an isomer of the oleuropein aglycon (3,4-DHPEA-EA), lignans such as (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol and (+)-pinoresinol, and flavonoids. A new method for the analysis of VOO hydrophilic phenols by direct injection in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the use of a fluorescence detector (FLD) has been proposed and compared with the traditional liquid-liquid extraction technique followed by the HPLC analysis utilizing a diode array detector (DAD) and a FLD. Results show that the most important classes of phenolic compounds occurring in VOO can be evaluated using HPLC direct injection. The efficiency of the new method, as compared to the liquid-liquid extraction, was higher to quantify phenyl alcohols, lignans, and 3,4-DHPEA-EA and lower for the evaluation of 3,4-DHPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EDA.","1049.0"
"Effect of processing on buckwheat phenolics and antioxidant activity","","The effect of processing on functional compounds in buckwheat was investigated. Extractions of buckwheat flour were carried out before and after roasting or extrusion. Folin-Ciocalteu assays indicated that processing did not cause any change in total phenolic content in buckwheat flour. Roasted (200 °C, 10 min) dark buckwheat flour exhibited an increase in non-polar compounds as well as polar compounds whereas extrusion exhibited increase only in polar compounds. Antioxidant activity test (DPPH) showed that roasting at 200 °C for 10 min decreased the antioxidant activity slightly whereas extrusion (170 °C) did not cause any change.

"Effect of technological processes and storage on flavonoids content and total, cumulative fast-kinetics and cumulative slow-kinetics antiradical activities of citrus juices","","Juices from the mandarin Clemenules (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.), the tangor Ortanique (Citrus reticulata Blanco x Citrus sinensis Osb.) and the sweet orange Valencia Late (Citrus sinensis) have been industrially squeezed, pasteurized, concentrated and stored under refrigeration (4 °C) and at room temperature (20 °C). After each process, the flavanone-7-O-glycosides (FGs) and fully methoxylated flavones (FMFs) contents as well as total, cumulative fast-kinetics and cumulative slow-kinetics antiradical activities were determined and compared with those from the corresponding fresh hand-squeezed juices. Neither industrial-squeezing, nor pasteurization or concentration significantly affected FGs and FMFs contents and antiradical activities of assayed juices. Storage caused a slight decrease of the FMFs contents but a significant reduction of both soluble hesperidin contents and cumulative fast-kinetics antiradical activities in all assayed juices. These decreases were dependent on storage temperature. Characteristic values of the varietal characterization parameters, which are derived from the FMFs contents and antiradical activities of fresh hand-squeezed juices, held valid for industrially squeezed, pasteurized and concentrated juices. After storage, however, only the FMFs-derived varietal characterization parameters and cumulative slow-kinetics antiradical activity remained valid for the resulting juices.","1051.0"

In this study, we analyzed plasma of volunteers that had consumed 325 micromol of either quercetin-3-glucoside or quercetin-4'-glucoside as an oral solution. Quercetin metabolites were extracted with acetonitrile/phosphoric acid and these extracts were analyzed using a high performance liquid chromatography with Coularray detection that distinguishes between the glucuronidated and the glucosylated forms of quercetin. No intact quercetin glucosides and only trace amounts of aglycone were found in human plasma, irrespective of the glucoside ingested. This was confirmed by spiking the plasma with glucoside standards. The major components in plasma had the same retention time as quercetin glucuronide standards. These plasma components disappeared after treatment of the plasma with bovine liver beta-glucuronidase, under reformation of quercetin, and showed the same oxidation pattern as the glucuronides. These results suggest that after consumption of quercetin glucosides, quercetin glucuronides are major metabolites in plasma.","1054.0"

Our objective in this study was to define the pharmacokinetics of natural S-(-)equol after administration of SE5-OH, a newly developed S-(-)equol supplement made by incubation of the equol-producing bacterium Lactococcus garvieae with soy germ isoflavones. In a single-center, open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover design study, the pharmacokinetics of S-(-)equol administered as single-bolus oral doses of 10 and 30 mg in the form of SE5-OH tablets was determined in 12 healthy postmenopausal women. S-(-)equol was measured in plasma and urine collected at timed intervals over a 48-h period postdosing using tandem MS. Equol-producer status was also determined after a soymilk challenge conducted after the pharmacokinetic sampling was complete. S-(-)equol was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and attained high plasma concentrations, with a plasma elimination half-life of 8 h. The maximum plasma concentration/dose, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity/dose, and the fraction of dose excreted in urine (%f(e,u)) were similar for the 2 doses, indicating a dose-proportional response in total S-(-)equol pharmacokinetics. The systemic bioavailability of S-(-)equol was very high, as the %f(e,u) was 82% for both doses, which is greater than published data for the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein.

"Antioxidant capacity of 26 spice extracts and characterization of their phenolic constituents","16190627.0","Total equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and phenolic content of 26 common spice extracts from 12 botanical families were investigated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of major phenolics in the spice extracts were systematically conducted by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Many spices contained high levels of phenolics and demonstrated high antioxidant capacity. Wide variation in TEAC values (0.55-168.7 mmol/100 g) and total phenolic content (0.04-14.38 g of gallic acid equivalent/100 g) was observed. A highly positive linear relationship (R2= 0.95) obtained between TEAC values and total phenolic content showed that phenolic compounds in the tested spices contributed significantly to their antioxidant capacity. Major types of phenolic constituents identified in the spice extracts were phenolic acids, phenolic diterpenes, flavonoids, and volatile oils (e.g., aromatic compounds). Rosmarinic acid was the dominant phenolic compound in the six spices of the family Labiatae. Phenolic volatile oils were the principal active ingredients in most spices. The spices and related families with the highest antioxidant capacity were screened, e.g., clove in the Myrtaceae, cinnamon in the Lauraceae, oregano in the Labiatae, etc., representing potential sources of potent natural antioxidants for commercial exploitation.

The antioxidant activity (AOA) increased significantly upon extrusion and this increase was the highest (36–69%) at 150°C and 20% feed moisture. The increase in feed moisture and temperature significantly increased the metal chelating activity. The reducing power decreased significantly upon extrusion as compared to their corresponding control samples. Extrusion lead to a greater increase in non-enzymatic browning (NEB) index however, increasing the moisture content of feed decreased the NEB index by 3–29% (at 180°C) and 1–17% (150°C), while increasing the temperature increased the NEB significantly.","1063.0"
"Quantitative comparison of volatile flavor compounds in deep-roasted and light-roasted sesame seed oil","","The effect of roasting degree on the formation of volatile compounds in sesame seeds was investigated. Light- and deep-roasted sesame seed oils were steam distilled under reduced pressure, and volatiles from the distillate were separated by an adsorptive column method. The recoveries of total volatiles were 9726 and 2014 ppb from deep- and light-roasted oils, respectively. The relative amount of monoalkylpyrazines decreased in contrast to the increases of di- and trialkylpyrazines with increase in the degree of roasting. 1H-Pyrrole-2-carboxyaldehyde, the most abundant pyrrole, was the only volatile that decreased in deep-roasted oil. 4,5-Dimethylisothiazole, 4,5-dimethylthiazole, 2-propyl-4-methylthiazole, and 2-butyl-5-methylthiazole increased their relative amounts in deep-roasted oil. Hexanal, (E)-2-heptenal, and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal occurred in almost the same levels. Guaiacol and 2-furanmethanethiol increased from 32 to 321 ppb and from 6 to 40 ppb, respectively, in deep-roasted oil.","1064.0"
"Intestinal absorption of luteolin and luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats and humans","9827549.0","In this study, we investigated the intestinal absorption of luteolin and luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside in rats by HPLC. The absorption analysis using rat everted small intestine demonstrated that luteolin was converted to glucuronides during passing through the intestinal mucosa and that luteolin 7-O-beta-glucoside was absorbed after hydrolysis to luteolin. Free luteolin, its conjugates and methylated conjugates were present in rat plasma after dosing. This suggests that some luteolin can escape the intestinal conjugation and the hepatic sulfation/methylation. LC/MS analysis showed that the main conjugate which circulates in the blood was a monoglucuronide of the unchanged aglycone. Luteolin in propyleneglycol was absorbed more rapidly than that in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose. The plasma concentration of luteolin and its conjugates reached the highest level 15 min and 30 min after dosing with luteolin in propyleneglycol, respectively. HPLC analysis also allowed us to demonstrate the presence of free luteolin and its monoglucuronide in human serum after ingestion of luteolin.","1065.0"
"Antimutagenic, antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity of ethyl acetate extracts from white, yellow and red onions","15019191.0","The beneficial effects of red, yellow and white onion extracts have been assessed by antioxidant activity and antimutagenic activity. And the effects compared to BHT and ascorbic acid. Total phenolic compounds and flavonoids in onion extracts were determined. Yellow onion extract had more organic acid and free sugar than those detected in the white and red onion extract. The scavenging activity of DPPH radical and H(2)O(2) were increased depending on the concentration. The antioxidant activities using beta-carotene-linoleate system and reducing power were increased but the effect was small to that of BHT and ascorbic acid. After digested, extracts showed antimutagenic activities, and it seems that they inhibit the mutagenicity for digesting. This study demonstrated that the antimutagenicities and antioxidant properties of ethyl acetate extract against mutagens were related to their phenols and flavonoids, which are heat stable and losses digestive juices are relatively low.","1066.0"

"Physico-chemical properties of polyphenol oxidase from d'anjou and Bartlett pears (Pyrus communis L.)","","Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and phenolics were studied in two pear cultivars, d'Anjou and Bartlett. PPO activity, total phenolics and chlorogenic acid concentration differed significantly with respect to cultivar. PPO activity, total phenolics and chlorogenic acid all decreased in overripe fruits. The pH optimum (d'Anjou, 4.7 and Bartlett, 5.5), and optimum temperature (d'Anjou 40C and Bartlett, 20C) for maximum PPO activity were determined. Among substrates, 4-methylcatechol followed by catechol and dopamine, was the most readily oxidized substrate of PPO from both pear cultivars. The enzyme from both cultivars did not show any activity with any of the monohydroxy substrates. Km of l3.33 and 10.92 mM were determined with 4-methylcatechol for d'Anjou and Bartlett pear PPO, respectively. Benzoic and cinnamic acid series compounds were poor inhibitors of PPO. However, L-cysteine, sodium metabisulfite, ascorbic acid and thiourea proved to be effective inhibitors of this enzyme. Heating at 65C for 30 min resulted in a loss of 60-72% of PPO activity.","1068.0"
"The content and antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in cold-pressed plant oils","","Many nontraditional vegetable oils have been introduced to the market relatively recently, and therefore data on their antioxidant potential have not been reported. Such data are of importance for the evaluation of the nutritional and health impact of these oils. Antioxidant properties of the methanolic extracts of cold-pressed oils such as soybean, sunflower, rapeseed, corn, grapeseed, hemp, flax, rice bran and pumpkin were studied. The methanolic extracts were obtained by solid phase extraction and separation, and identification of phenolic acids was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography. The obtained extracts were characterized by different scavenging activities of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals. The best antioxidant properties were displayed by the extract from hemp, pumpkin and rapeseed oils. The highest content of total phenolic compounds was determined for the pumpkin and hemp oils - about 2.4 mg/100 g. Rapeseed oil was characterized by the highest content of phenolic acids, especially sinapic acid. To better understand the beneficial effects of antioxidant compounds in vegetable oils, it is important to investigate whether these bioactive compounds in oils differ in their reactions with free radicals. Phenolic compounds have been reported to be present in all vegetable oils, which is very important for the oxidative stability of the polyunsaturated fatty acids of these oils. Additionally, edible oils rich in natural antioxidants may play a role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Thus, the oils examined may be used in different food applications to provide nutrition and health benefits.","1069.0"
"The antioxidant activity of selected cruciferous vegetables subjected to aquathermal processing","","Kale (Brassica oleracea var. Acephala), broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis italica), Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea L. var. gemmifera) and green and white cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis) were used to determine their contents of antioxidising agents: vitamin C, carotenoids and polyphenols. The examined vegetables were found to contain between 40.6 and 107 mg/100 g FW of vitamin C, from 0.04 to 2.7 mg/100 g FW of carotenoids, and from 144 to 773 mg/100 g FW of polyphenols. Cauliflower was found to contain the smallest amount of these compounds and kale the largest. The antioxidant activity of the vegetables was determined on the basis of their ability to extinguish the ABTS free radical. The aquathermal processes to which the vegetables were subsequently subjected reduced their antioxidant activity, mainly due to escape of vitamin C and polyphenols into the water environment. These losses were largest in the case of leafy or highly fragmented vegetables.","1070.0"
"Flavanone metabolism in healthy and tumor-bearing rats","16952436.0","Flavanones, the main polyphenols of citrus fruits, are thought to contribute to the protective effects of these fruits against cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The metabolism of naringin (naringenin 7-O-neohesperidoside) is studied here in healthy (sham-operated, ShO) and tumor-bearing (TuB) rats. The tumor was induced by implanting Yoshida's sarcoma in hindlimb. Both groups received for 7 days a semi-synthetic diet containing 0.5% naringin in per feeding conditions. Flavanones were analyzed in plasma, liver, kidney and urine by tandem mass spectrometry. Naringenin conjugates (essentially glucuronides) accounted for up to 98% of the total flavanones in plasma. Low amounts of hesperetin (4'-O-methyl naringénine) and isosakuranetin (3'-hydroxy-4'-O-methylnaringenin) were also detected in all biological samples and accounted for 2% of the total flavanones in plasma. They were largely present as aglycones. The in vivo hydroxylation of flavanones is described here for the first time. Total concentrations of naringenin metabolites reached 17.3+/-2.7 microM in plasma 6 hours after the beginning of the meal in healthy rats and only 10.6+/-1.3 microM in TuB rats. The nature of metabolites was similar in both healthy and TuB rats and in plasma, tissues and urine. The lower concentration of flavanones in the TuB rats suggests that disease and more particularly cancer, may affect the bioavailability of flavonoids.","1071.0"

"Polyphenol content and total antioxidant potential of selected Italian wines","","The total antioxidant activity (TAA) of 13 typical Italian wines was determined (average 12.3 and 1.6 mM Trolox equivalents for red and white wines, respectively), and the resulting values were correlated with total phenols (1365-3326 and 96-146 mg/L for red and white wines, respectively), flavanols (203-805 and 11-49 mg/L, for red and white wines, respectively), and flavonols. Only the red wines contained appreciable amounts of flavonols (average 15.3 mg/L), with quercetin and rutin being the most abundant, followed by myricetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin accounting for only 0.7-3% of TAA. The TAA of investigated wines are well correlated with phenol (r = 0.9902) and flavanol (r = 0.9270) content. These results confirm that red wine polyphenols are in vitro significant antioxidants and may explain the beneficial effects of a moderate daily intake of red wines, probably through a sparing action of highly bioavailable vitamins C, E, and beta-carotene.","1076.0"
"Retention and changes of soy isoflavones and carotenoids in immature soybean seeds (Edamame) during processing","11141271.0","Isoflavones and carotenoids in four experimental genotypes and Hutcheson cultivar soybeans were evaluated as a function of processing treatments and maturity. Total isoflavone and carotenoid contents were affected by genotypes and maturity stages (p < 0.0001). Total isoflavones ranged from 472 microg/g (in NTCPR93-40) to 2280 microg/g (in Hutcheson). Lutein contents ranged from 895 (in NTCPR93-286) to 2119 (in Honey Brown), and beta-carotene ranged from 291 (in Hutcheson) to 491 (in NICPR92-40) microg/100 g. Mean total isoflavone retention percentages in immature Hutcheson soybeans were 46% (boiling), 53% (freezing), and 40% (freeze-drying). Mean retentions of lutein and beta-carotene, respectively, were 92 and 73% in frozen, 62 and 62% in boiled, and 34 and 27% in freeze-dried soybeans. Boiling caused a substantial increase in daidzin, genistin, and genistein. The results show that post-harvest changes in total isoflavones and carotenoids in soybeans are influenced by processing methods, but genotype has an effect on isoflavone and carotenoid profiles during seed development.","1077.0"
"Polyphenolic composition of Marion and Evergreen blackberries","","The polyphenolics in aqueous extracts of Marion (Rubus sp. hyb) and Evergreen (Rubus laciniatus) blackberries and blackberry seeds were isolated by solid-phase extraction using C18 cartridges and polyamide mini-column chromatography, and characterized using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/diode array spectral techniques. Flavonols (primarily quercetin glycosides) were the major phenolics in berries, whereas procyanidins (catechin and epicatechin) and ellagic acid derivatives predominated in seeds. No flavonols were found in seeds. Evergreen berries contained higher level of epicatechin, ellagic acid derivatives, and flavonols than Marion berries, whereas Marion berries and seeds were higher in anthocyanins, total phenolics, and antioxidant properties as measured by oxygen radical absorbance capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power.","1078.0"

Total phenolics did not show a marked change with maturity with values slightly decreasing from underripe to ripe. Antioxidant activities, while increasing with ripening, also did not show the marked change that total anthocyanins exhibited. The impact of variation due to plots, subsampling, sample preparation, and measurement on Marion composition was examined in detail. Plot-to-plot and sample differences were the major contributors to variation, with sample preparation being an important contributor for some parameters.

"The influence of variety and harvest time on the bitterness and phenolic compounds of olive oil","","The health benefits of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), including improved cardiovascular health and metabolic function, are linked to its phenolic content. This study evaluated how storage duration and packaging affect the phenolic composition and sensory quality of Corbella EVOO. Oils were analyzed at production and after 6 and 12 months of storage in two types of packaging: bag-in-box; stainless steel containers with a nitrogen headspace. UPLC-MS/MS profiling quantified 23 phenolic compounds, predominantly secoiridoids such as oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones. Oleuropein aglycone increased over time, whereas ligstroside aglycone peaked mid-storage before declining, likely converting to oleocanthal. Lignans and flavonoids degraded during storage, although luteolin increased, potentially due to glucoside hydrolysis. Bag-in-box packaging better preserved phenolic content than stainless steel. A sensory analysis corroborated the chemical findings, with oils stored in stainless steel showing greater reductions in pungency and astringency. A Pearson correlation linked bitterness with oleuropein aglycone (r = 0.44) and oleacein (r = 0.66), pungency with oleocanthal (r = 0.81), and astringency with oleacein (r = 0.86) and oleocanthal (r = 0.71). These findings highlight the importance of packaging in preserving the phenolic composition responsible for the sensory qualities of EVOO over time.","1080.0"

"Effect of drying of figs (Ficus carica L.) on the contents of sugars, organic acids, and phenolic compounds","21958361.0","Fresh figs were subjected to two different drying processes: sun-drying and oven-drying. To assess their effect on the nutritional and health-related properties of figs, sugars, organic acids, single phenolics, total phenolics, and antioxidant activity were determined before and after processing. Samples were analyzed three times in a year, and phenolic compounds were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). In figs, monomer sugars predominate, which is important nutritional information, and the content of sugars as well as organic acids in fresh figs was lower than in dried fruits. However, the best sugar/organic acid ratio was measured after the sun-drying process. Analysis of individual phenolic compounds revealed a higher content of all phenolic groups determined after the oven-drying process, with the exception of cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside. Similarly, higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were detected after the drying process. With these results it can be concluded that the differences in analyzed compounds in fresh and dried figs are significant. The differences between the sun-dried and oven-dried fruits were determined in organic acids, sugars, chlorogenic acid, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, luteolin-8-C-glucoside, and total phenolic contents. The results indicate that properly dried figs can be used as a good source of phenolic compounds.","1083.0"
"Activity and concentration of polyphenolic antioxidants in apple juice. 1. Effect of existing production methods","12452634.0","Apples are an important source of flavonoids in the human diet. The effect of processing apples into juice on polyphenolic antioxidant content and activity is described. Raw juice obtained from Jonagold apples by pulping and straight pressing or after pulp enzyming had an antioxidant activity that was only 10 and 3%, respectively, of the activity of the fresh apples. The levels of flavonoids and chlorogenic acid in the juice were reduced to between 50% (chlorogenic acid) and 3% (catechins). Most of the antioxidants were retained in the pomace rather than being transferred into the juice. Apparently, most of the antioxidant compounds are absorbed to the solid matter of the pomace. In apple juice, 45% of the total measured antioxidant activity could be ascribed to the analyzed antioxidants. For three apple cultivars tested (Elstar, Golden Delicious, and Jonagold), the processing methods had similar effects. The results indicate that processing can have a major impact on the bioactivity of products.","1084.0"

"Antioxidant activities and anthocyanin content of fresh fruits of common fig (Ficus carica L.)","17002444.0","Fig fruit has been a typical component in the health-promoting Mediterranean diet for millennia. To study the potential health-promoting constituents of fig fruits, six commercial fig varieties differing in color (black, red, yellow, and green) were analyzed for total polyphenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, and amount and profile of anthocyanins. Using reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC), various concentrations of anthocyanins but a similar profile was found in all varieties studied. Hydrolysis revealed cyanidin as the major aglycon. Proton and carbon NMR confirmed cyanidin-3-O-rhamnoglucoside (cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; C3R) as the main anthocyanin in all fruits. Color appearance of fig extract correlated well with total polyphenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacity. Extracts of darker varieties showed higher contents of phytochemicals compared to lighter colored varieties. Fruit skins contributed most of the above phytochemicals and antioxidant activity compared to the fruit pulp. Antioxidant capacity correlated well with the amounts of polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.985 and 0.992, respectively). In the dark-colored Mission and the red Brown-Turkey varieties, the anthocyanin fraction contributed 36 and 28% of the total antioxidant capacity, respectively.

"Antioxidant compounds from bananas (Musa Cavendish)","","Functional foods are gaining heightened popularity in diet modifications. Green bananas contain a significant quantity of resistant starch, dietary fibre, and phytochemicals that demonstrate strong antioxidant properties, particularly due to the high concentration of polyphenols. The community demand for incorporating these essential components into food products, such as bread, has increased. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in the content and bio-accessibility of phenolic compounds in bread enriched with 5, 10, and 15% of Australian green banana powder (GBF) from (Cavendish ""<i>Musa acuminata</i>"", Ladyfinger ""<i>Musa paradisiaca</i> L."", and Ducasse ""<i>Musa balbisiana</i>""), as well as their antioxidant capabilities and the generation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation. The 15% Cavendish bread exhibited significant TPC and TFC at 1.31 mg GAE/g and 0.05 mg QE/g, respectively, along with substantial antioxidant activity (DPPH, 0.40 mg TE/g), observed following stomach and intestinal phases. However, the 15% Ladyfinger bread exhibited the highest TTC following the stomach digestion, with 17.4 mg CE/g. The bio-accessibility of most phenolic components from 10% GBF-bread was elevated following the gastric and intestinal phases. Nonetheless, a substantial total phenolic content (50.3% in Ladyfinger bread) was still observable in the residue during colonic fermentation. The highest SCFAs production occurred in Cavendish and Ducasse bread after 24 h of fermentation. Overall, the consumption of GBF bread can positively influence intestinal health and provide antioxidant properties, facilitating future advancements in the creation of nutrient-dense and health-enhancing bakery products.","1091.0"
"Soy isoflavone analysis: quality control and a new internal standard","","Development of a database of the soy isoflavone content of foods requires accurate and precise evaluation of different food matrixes. To evaluate accuracy, we estimated recoveries of both internal and external standards in 5 different soyfoods weekly. Standards were evaluated daily for system quality assurance. To evaluate sample precision, we analyzed soybeans and soymilk bimonthly for within-day precision and over 4 d for day-to-day precision. CVs should be < or = 8%. We validated our methods for single and multiple recovery concentrations by using our new internal standard, 2,4,4'-trihydroxydeoxybenzoin, and the external standards daidzein, genistein, and genistin. Concentrations of 12 isoflavone isomers, 3 aglycones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein), and 9 glucosides (daidzin, genistin, glycitin, acetyldaidzin, acetylgenistin, acetylglycitin, malonyldaidzin, malonylgenistin, and malonylglycitin) were measured in a variety of soybeans and soyfoods. The extraction methods used depended on soyfood type. The HPLC conditions for soy isoflavone analysis were improved, leading to good separation with a short analysis time (60 min/sample). A data bank of concentration and distribution of isoflavones in different soybean products was assembled. A wide range of isoflavone concentrations, from < 50 microg/g to > 20,000 microg/g, was found in different soy products. The glucoside forms are almost twice the molecular weight of the aglycones; reported isoflavone concentrations should be normalized to the aglycone mass (or an isoflavonoid equivalent) rather than a simple sum of all isomers.","1092.0"
"Free, esterified, and insoluble-bound phenolic acids. 3. Composition of phenolic acids in cereal and potato flours","","Buckwheat, a dicotyledonous pseudocereal from the Polygonaceae family, has emerged as a crop of scientific and industrial interest due to its exceptional phytochemical profile, adaptability to different environments, and minimal agronomic input requirements. This paper aims to highlight the proximate composition (carbohydrates, protein, dietary fiber, lipids, starch, vitamins, and minerals) of the buckwheat principal species, <i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i> Moench (common buckwheat) and <i>Fagopyrum tataricum</i> (L.) Gaertn (Tartary buckwheat). Other bioactive compounds, including flavonoids (e.g., rutin, quercetin), phenolic acids, and anthocyanins, were emphasized, together with their influence on human health. These constituents confer a broad range of biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and hypoglycemic effects. Moreover, buckwheat is inherently gluten-free, making it a valuable alternative in formulations targeting gluten-sensitive populations. Finally, the review addresses the possibility of using starch buckwheat as a raw material in starch-based films. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential of buckwheat starch as a viable material for the development of biodegradable food packaging films.","1093.0"

"Influence of two fertilization regimens on the amounts of organic acids and phenolic compounds of tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC)","16277412.0","A phytochemical study was undertaken on tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata DC) cultivated under conventional and organic practices and collected at different times. Six organic acids (aconitic, citric, ascorbic, malic, shikimic, and fumaric acids) were identified and quantified by HPLC-UV. Qualitative and quantitative differences were noted between internal and external leaves. Analysis of the phenolics of the internal leaves was achieved by HPLC-DAD, and the phenolic profile obtained was revealed to be distinct from that of the external leaves. By this means were identified and quantified 11 compounds: 3-p-coumaroylquinic acid, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(caffeoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(sinapoyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl)sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside, two isomeric forms of 1,2-disinapoylgentiobiose, 1-sinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, and 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose. In general, internal leaves exhibited more constant chemical profiles.","1095.0"
"Determination of trans-resveratrol concentrations in Brazilian red wines by HPLC","","The levels of trans-resveratrol in 36 commercial red wines produced in the southern region of Brazil have been measured using a direct injection isocratic UV-HPLC method.

"Influence of processing and storage on the phenolic composition of apple juice","","Consumer demands for fresh and minimally processed liquid foods that support disease prevention and promote health emphasize the need for innovative processing technologies that ensure microbiological safety and preserve bioactive compounds. In addition, consumers are becoming more concerned about the presence of chemical additives in liquid foods. Non-thermal processing technologies, including high-pressure processing, high-pressure homogenization, pulsed electric field, pulsed magnetic field, high-pressure carbon dioxide, ultrasound treatment, radiation processing, ozone processing, cold plasma, and membrane processing, offer excellent prospects for the application in liquid foods. The given technologies aim to retain bioactive properties, deactivate enzymatic activity, and destroy microorganisms, thereby extending the shelf life of liquid foods. Thus, this current review, without a doubt, could be valuable to the liquid food industries and the scientific world by offering great insight into the latest developments in the use of innovative non-thermal processing technologies, which can be employed for shelf life extension and the retention of bioactive compounds in liquid foods. This paper also discusses the challenges faced by the liquid food industry that need to be addressed in future studies.","1097.0"
"Variability in the Distribution of Phenolic Compounds in Milled Fractions of Chickpea and Horse Gram: Evaluation of Their Antioxidant Properties","20593828.0","Seed coat, cotyledon and embryonic axe fractions of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum L.) were evaluated for their phenolic composition in relation to antioxidant activities. Compositional analysis of phenolics by HPLC revealed a wide variation in the distribution of flavonols, isoflavones, phenolic acids and anthocyanins among these legume fractions. Although cotyledon fractions of both the legumes were rich in phenolic acids, the concentrations of flavonols such as quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin were significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the embryonic axe and seed coat fractions. Ferulic, chlorogenic, caffeic, and vanillic acids were the principal phenolic acids found in cotyledons. The most striking difference was the predominance of isoflavones in embryonic axe fractions. Although the isoflavone genistein was detected in all three fractions of chickpea, it was present exclusively in the embryonic axe fraction of horse gram at levels greater than daidzein. Furthermore, cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin were detected in seed coat and embryonic axe fractions but not in cotyledons. In addition to these three anthocyanins, malvidin was found only in the horse gram seed coat fraction. Seed coat fractions having higher total phenolic indexes were found to be the most active 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavengers (IC(50) 13.1 to 18.6 microg/mL) followed by embryonic axe and cotyledon fractions (IC(50) 15.4 to 34.2 microg/mL). Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) scavenging capacities of cotyledons, embryonic axe and seed coats were 12.3, 34.1 and 78.6% for chickpea and 15.1, 56.8 and 92.6% for horse gram, respectively. The multiple antioxidant activity of horse gram and chickpea fractions was evident, as they also possessed reducing power and ferrous ion-chelating potency. These results contributed to the understanding of the relationships between major phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities of legumes and provided useful information for effective utilization of legume-milled fractions as functional food ingredients for promoting health.","1098.0"
"Absorption, metabolism and excretion of Choladi green tea flavan-3-ols by humans","18979506.0","Ten healthy human subjects consumed 500 mL of Choladi green tea, containing 648 mumol of flavan-3-ols after which plasma and urine were collected over a 24 h period and analysed by HPLC-MS. Plasma contained a total of ten metabolites, in the form of O-methylated, sulphated and glucuronide conjugates of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, with 29-126 nM peak plasma concentrations (C(max)) occurring 1.6-2.3 h after ingestion, indicative of absorption in the small intestine. Plasma also contained unmetabolised (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate with respective C(max) values of 55 and 25 nM. Urine excreted 0-24 h after consumption of green tea contained 15 metabolites of (epi)catechin and (epi)gallocatechin, but (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate were not detected. Overall flavan-3-ol metabolite excretion was equivalent to 8.1% of intake, however, urinary (epi)gallocatechin metabolites corresponded to 11.4% of (epi)gallocatechin ingestion while (epi)catechin metabolites were detected in amounts equivalent to 28.5% of (epi)catechin intake. These findings imply that (epi)catechins are highly bioavailable, being absorbed and excreted to a much greater extent than most other flavonoids. It is also evident that flavan-3-ol metabolites are rapidly turned over in the circulatory system and as a consequence C(max) values are not an accurate quantitative indicator of the extent to which absorption occurs.","1099.0"
"Metabolite profiling of hydroxycinnamate derivatives in plasma and urine after the ingestion of coffee by humans: identification of biomarkers of coffee consumption","19460943.0","Human subjects drank coffee containing 412 mumol of chlorogenic acids, and plasma and urine were collected 0 to 24 h after ingestion and were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Within 1 h, some of the components in the coffee reached nanomole peak plasma concentrations (C(max)), whereas chlorogenic acid metabolites, including caffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and sulfates of 3- and 4-caffeoylquinic acid lactones, had higher C(max) values. The short time to reach C(max) (T(max)) indicates absorption of these compounds in the small intestine. In contrast, dihydroferulic acid, its 4-O-sulfate, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate exhibited much higher C(max) values (145-385 nM) with T(max) values in excess of 4 h, indicating absorption in the large intestine and the probable involvement of catabolism by colonic bacteria. These three compounds, along with ferulic acid-4-O-sulfate and dihydroferulic acid-4-O-glucuronide, were also major components to be excreted in urine (8.4-37.1 mumol) after coffee intake. Feruloylglycine, which is not detected in plasma, was also a major urinary component (20.7 mumol excreted). Other compounds, not accumulating in plasma but excreted in smaller quantities, included the 3-O-sulfate and 3-O-glucuronide of isoferulic acid, dihydro(iso)ferulic acid-3-O-glucuronide, and dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-glucuronide. Overall, the 119.9 mumol excretion of the chlorogenic acid metabolites corresponded to 29.1% of intake, indicating that as well as being subject to extensive metabolism, chlorogenic acids in coffee are well absorbed. Pathways for the formation of the various metabolites within the body are proposed. Urinary dihydrocaffeic acid-3-O-sulfate and feruloylglycine are potentially very sensitive biomarkers for the consumption of relatively small amounts of coffee.","1100.0"
"Molecular definition of the taste of roasted cocoa nibs (Theobroma cacao) by means of quantitative studies and sensory experiments","16848542.0","Sensory-guided decomposition of roasted cocoa nibs revealed that, besides theobromine and caffeine, a series of bitter-tasting 2,5-diketopiperazines and flavan-3-ols were the key inducers of the bitter taste as well as the astringent mouthfeel imparted upon consumption of roasted cocoa. In addition, a number of polyphenol glycopyranosides as well as a series of N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids have been identified as key astringent compounds of roasted cocoa. In the present investigation, a total of 84 putative taste compounds were quantified in roasted cocoa beans and then rated for the taste contribution on the basis of dose-over-threshold (DoT) factors to bridge the gap between pure structural chemistry and human taste perception. To verify these quantitative results, an aqueous taste reconstitute was prepared by blending aqueous solutions of the individual taste compounds in their ""natural"" concentrations. Sensory analyses revealed that the taste profile of this artificial cocktail was very close to the taste profile of an aqueous suspension of roasted cocoa nibs. To further narrow down the number of key taste compounds, finally, taste omission experiments and human dose/response functions were performed, demonstrating that the bitter-tasting alkaloids theobromine and caffeine, seven bitter-tasting diketopiperazines, seven bitter- and astringent-tasting flavan-3-ols, six puckering astringent N-phenylpropenoyl-l-amino acids, four velvety astringent flavonol glycosides, gamma-aminobutyric acid, beta-aminoisobutyric acid, and six organic acids are the key organoleptics of the roasted cocoa nibs.","1101.0"
"Minerals, phytic acid, tannin and rutin in buckwheat seed milling fractions","","The composition of common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) seed milling fractions depends upon the relative abundance of various seed tissues in each. Fancy (light) flour contains mainly central endosperm, while the bran milling fraction has seed coat and some embryo tissues. Phytate, found in protein bodies of embryo and aleurone cells, is the major storage form of phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and some microelements in seeds. Phytic acid (35-38 g kg(-1)) and minerals are concentrated in bran, a milling fraction with high concentrations of phytate-rich tissues. Polyphenolics, including condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins), are also concentrated in bran (11-15 g kg(-1)). Rutin is concentrated in the hull of common buckwheat (0.8-4.4 g kg(-1)). Rutin concentration is low (0.2-0.3 g kg(-1)) in groats of common buckwheat but higher (0.7-0.8 g kg(-1)) in bran containing hull fragments. Rutin is 300-fold more concentrated (81 g kg(-1)) in groats of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum (L) Gaertn) than in groats of common buckwheat. Only small amounts of quercetin were detected. Bran is a concentrated source of phytic acid and tannins, a consideration in consumption of large amounts of buckwheat bran for nutritional or medicinal purposes.","1102.0"
"Determination of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine and related biological products by HPLC and HPLC-ESI-MS-MS","11605763.0","To investigate probable health benefits of flavonoids and stilbenes in red wine a new reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid-chromatographic (HPLC) method with enhanced separation efficiency and improved selectivity, sensitivity, and speed has been established for determination of the flavonoids quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol and the stilbenes cis- and trans-resveratrol, in a single run . UV-absorbance, fluorescence (FLD), and mass-spectrometric (MS) detection were also evaluated. UV-absorbance detection at 320 nm for stilbenes and 377 nm for flavonoids enables their determination up to the nanogram range with a linearity of R2>0.9999 (linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)). Calculated values of average recoveries were between 95 and 105% for all analytes. For resveratrol, fluorescence detection was highly selective and twice as sensitive as UV detection, and linearity was satisfactory (R2>0.9996; linear range see UV detection). For the detection of the hydrophilic glycosidic compounds piceid and rutin, which are coeluted with other hydrophilic ingredients, the validated RP HPLC system was coupled to a quadrupole ion-trap mass-spectrometer (MS) via an electrospray interface (ESI) with 25% ammonia solution as sheath liquid. MS detection was, highly linear (R2>0.9878; linear range 50 ng mL(-1)-50 microg mL(-1)) for all investigated analytes and the limits of detection were in the low nanogram range. Compared with UV detection MS detection resulted in a 200% increase in signal intensity for myricetin and 400% increases for quercetin and kaempferol, but equal signal intensity for resveratrol. Calculated values of average recoveries were 102% for myricetin and 79% for piceid. Collision induced dissociation (CID) was also used to obtain characteristic fragmentation fingerprints to facilitate qualitative and quantitative analysis even in complex matrices. Finally, this hyphenated HPLC-ESI-MS method was highly suitable and an essential improvement compared with UV- and fluorescence detection.","1103.0"
"Quantitative analysis of xanthohumol and related prenylflavonoids in hops and beer by liquid chromatography_tandem mass spectrometry","10070768.0","A method for quantitation of six prenylflavonoids (xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, desmethylxanthohumol, 6- and 8-prenylnaringenins and 6-geranylnaringenin) in hops and beer by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. The method allows direct analysis of beer and crude methanolic extracts of hops. After HPLC separation, prenylflavonoids were detected by positive ion multiple-reaction monitoring using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a heated nebulizer--atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The accuracy and precision were evaluated by replicate analyses of (spiked) samples. Thirteen commercial beers were analysed with the method. Isoxanthohumol, formed by isomerization of xanthohumol during the brewing process, was the most abundant flavonoid in hopped beers, ranging from 0.04 to 3.44 mg/l.","1104.0"
"Occurrence of flavonols in tomatoes and tomato-based products","10898604.0","The flavonol contents of 20 varieties of tomato fruit were investigated in relation to variety, size, season, and country of origin. Ten commonly consumed tomato-based food products were also assessed. Free and conjugated flavonols were identified and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC. Ninety-eight percent of flavonols detected in tomatoes were found to occur in the skin. Tomatoes contained, primarily as conjugates, quercetin and kaempferol. The main quercetin conjugate was identified as rutin (quercetin 3-rhamnosylglucoside) by LC-MS. The total flavonol content of the different varieties of tomato that were analyzed varied from 1.3 to 22.2 microgram/g of fresh weight (fw). Smaller cherry tomato fruits originating from warm sunny climates, such as Spain and Israel, were found to contain the highest concentration of flavonols. Among the tomato-based products investigated, tomato juice and tomato purée were rich in flavonols, containing 14-16 microgram/mL and 70 microgram/g fw, respectively. In contrast to fresh tomatoes, most tomato-based products contained significant amounts of free flavonols.","1105.0"
"On-line high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in green and black tea","15602765.0","Teas represent a rich source of dietary antioxidants. This paper describes analysis of the antioxidant potential of individual tea phenolics using an on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Tea phenolics from Kenyan green and black teas were identified using liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)) in conjunction with the analysis of their 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS+) radical scavenging ability. Antioxidant potential of flavan-3-ols, caffeoylquinic acids, flavonols, and theaflavins was assessed in comparison to the synthetic vitamin E analogue Trolox. (-)-Epigallocatechin gallate was identified as the most potent antioxidant with a Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 3.0, contributing approximately 30% of the total antioxidant capacity of green tea. Theaflavins retained antioxidant capacity similar to that of (-)-epicatechin monomers whilst conjugated flavonols did not contribute significantly to the antioxidant capacity of either green or black tea. After HPLC analysis of the antioxidant capacity of phenolics in black tea some 80% of antioxidant activity remained unaccounted for indicating the potential importance of thearubigens as antioxidants in black teas.","1106.0"
"Pharmacokinetics of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in healthy volunteers fed freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 7 days","16172180.0","Eleven subjects completed a clinical trial to determine the safety/tolerability of freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) and to measure, in plasma and urine, specific anthocyanins-cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, and cyanidin-3-xylosylrutinoside, as well as ellagic acid. Subjects were fed 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily for 7 days. Blood samples were collected predose on days 1 and 7 and at 10 time points postdose. Urine was collected for 12 hours predose on days 1 and 7 and at three 4-hour intervals postdose. Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma occurred at 1 to 2 hours, and maximum quantities in urine appeared from 0 to 4 hours. Overall, less than 1% of these compounds were absorbed and excreted in urine. None of the pharmacokinetic parameters changed significantly between days 1 and 7. In conclusion, 45 g of freeze-dried BRB daily are well tolerated and result in quantifiable anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma and urine.","1107.0"

"Composition and properties of flaxseed phenolic oligomers","26050172.0","An extract from flaxseed containing oligomeric structures of the phenolic glucosides secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), p-coumaric acid glucoside and ferulic acid glucoside was fractionated into three oligomeric fractions (F50, F60 and F70) by reversed phase liquid chromatography and further subfractionated by Sepharose CL-6B. The F50 fraction, which had the highest proportion of hydroxycinnamic acid glucosides, was also fractionated on Sephadex LH-20 according to hydrophobicity and size. The different separations resulted in complex profiles of UV-absorbing molecules. HPLC analyses indicated that reversed-phase chromatography separated the oligomers according to composition of the phenolic glucosides, while the subfractionation revealed that other structural features of the oligomers were also important. Using the DPPH radical, SDG and oligomeric fractions showed similar hydrogen-donating abilities comparable to ferulic acid but higher than α-tocopherol, which suggests that SDG was the only active antioxidant.","1109.0"

The total phenolic glucoside content ranged from 15 to 157mg/100g dry bread. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside was the dominating phenolic glucoside with an average relative content of 62%, followed by p-coumaric acid glucoside (20%) and ferulic acid glucoside (18%). Strong positive correlations between the phenolic glucosides were found, indicating no major effect of raw material or bread-making process on the relative content of the phenolic glucosides in flaxseed.","1110.0"
"Determination of total content of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity in vegetables - evaluation of spectrophotometric methods","16448157.0","This research studies in detail the contents of phenolic compounds determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the antioxidant activities determined by the TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity), DPPH (using diphenyl-p-picrylhydrazyl radical), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods, and their correlations for used standards with these methods (catechine, gallic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, Trolox, ascorbic acid, and ferrous sulfate) and extracts from several species of commonly consumed vegetables were studied in detail. The comparison of absolute values of absorption coefficients for used standards and for individual methods allows one to choose optimal common standards for methods to be compared. The procedures applied for the same sets of the extracts using identical calibration procedures and common standards allowed better comparison of the results obtained by the TEAC, DPPH, and FRAP methods. The values of content of phenolic substances and total antioxidant activity of the sets of samples correlate very well for all used methods. The very high values of antioxidant activity were found in intensely colored vegetables (red cabbage, red onion, etc.), and the values were very low in watery vegetables such as potato, marrow, and cucumber.","1111.0"
"Improved method for identifying and quantifying olive oil phenolic compounds and their metabolites in human plasma by microelution solid-phase extraction plate and liquid chromatography-tandem mass sp","19913464.0","Two methods based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) using traditional cartridges and microelution SPE plates (muSPE) as the sample pre-treatment, and an improved liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were developed and compared to determine the phenolic compounds in virgin oil olive from plasma samples. The phenolic compounds studied were hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, homovanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA-EDA, luteolin, apigenin, pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol. Good recoveries were obtained in both methods, and the LOQs and LODs were similar, in the range of low muM. The advantage of muSPE, in comparison with SPE cartridges, was the lack of the evaporation step to pre-concentrate the analytes. The muSPE-UPLC-ESI-MS/MS method developed was then applied to determine the phenolic compounds and their metabolites, in glucuronide, sulphate and methylated forms, in human plasma after the ingestion of virgin olive oil.","1112.0"
"Aseptically packaged UHPH-treated apple juice: Safety and quality parameters during storage","","Ultra-high pressure homogenization (UHPH) at 300MPa and 4°C inlet temperature were used to preserve apple juice, and shelf-life evaluation of aseptically packaged juice was investigated. After processing Tetra Brik containers were stored at temperatures of 4, 10, 20 and 30°C during 60days. In this article, the effect of processing on the spoilage inactivation was evaluated after processing and during the storage trial. Non-germinated and germinated spores were found in the UHPH-treated juice, being an inactive population during storage. Patulin content was also not modified by UHPH processing, but a significant decrease was observed during storage at 30°C (P<0.05). Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and pectinmethylesterase (PME) activity was not found after UHPH-processing and during storage. A kinetic study of post-processing quality loss was conducted. Vitamin C, chlorogenic acid, total polyphenols and color change were measured during storage study and were used to model the UHPH-treated apple juice shelf-life. Loss of vitamin C was correlated with the hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) accumulation (0.59, P<0.05). A limiting quality parameter was polyphenolic content. UHPH-treated apple juice stored at 4°C was found to show a shelf-life for about 21months by preserving the color characteristics of the juice with low HMF accumulation. From 15°C changes in quality parameters were more evident.","1113.0"
"High performance liquid chromatography of the neutral phenolic compounds of low molecular weight in apple juice","","The neutral phenolic compounds, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, flavan-3-ols polymers (procyanidins), phloridzin, phloretin xyloglucoside, and the flavonol glycosides (isoquercitrin, hyperin, quercitrin, avicularin, and rutin), in apple juice were extracted with ethyl acetate and separated and quantified by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column using an acidified water (pH 2.8)-methanol solvent gradient. A diode array detector was used to evaluate the separation and to identify the phenolic compounds. The recovery obtained for the flavanols and some dihydrochalcones ranged between 93% and 106%. On the contrary, the 30% recovery rate obtained for flavonols shows that ethyl acetate liquid-liquid extraction, usually employed in this type of study, is not recommended for the extraction of these last compounds.","1114.0"
"Effect of different cooking methods on the antioxidant activity of some vegetables from Pakistan","","The effects of different cooking methods (boiling, frying and microwave cooking) on the antioxidant activity of some selected vegetables (peas, carrot, spinach, cabbage, cauliflower, yellow turnip and white turnip) were assessed by measuring the total phenolic contents (TPC), reducing power and percentage inhibition in linoleic acid system. TPC (gallic acid equivalents g/100 g of dry weight) and reducing power of the methanolic extracts of raw-, microwaved-, boiled- and fried vegetables ranged 0.333-2.97, 0.52-2.68, 0.48-2.08, 1.00-2.02 and 0.391-2.24, 0.822-1.10, 0.547-1.16, 0.910-4.07, respectively. The level of inhibition of peroxidation ranged 71.4-89.0, 66.4-87.3, 73.2-89.2 and 77.4-91.3%, respectively. Antioxidant activity of the vegetables examined was appreciably affected because of varying cooking treatments. TPC of vegetables, generally, decreased by boiling, frying and microwave cooking. There was a significant (P < 0.05) increase in reducing power as a result of frying. However, boiling and microwave cooking did not affect reducing power. Inhibition of peroxidation increased by boiling and frying, whereas, in contrast it was decreased by microwave cooking. The results of the present investigation showed that all the cooking methods affected the antioxidant properties of the vegetables; however, microwave treatment exhibited more deleterious effects when compared with those of other treatments. Thus an appropriate method might be sought for the processing of such vegetables to retain their antioxidant components at maximum level.","1115.0"
"Antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of common fruits","","Consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, especially phenolics, in fruits and vegetables are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds for the health benefits. However, the phenolic contents and their antioxidant activities in fruits and vegetables were underestimated in the literature, because bound phenolics were not included. This study was designed to investigate the profiles of total phenolics, including both soluble free and bound forms in common fruits, by applying solvent extraction, base digestion, and solid-phase extraction methods. Cranberry had the highest total phenolic content, followed by apple, red grape, strawberry, pineapple, banana, peach, lemon, orange, pear, and grapefruit. Total antioxidant activity was measured using the TOSC assay. Cranberry had the highest total antioxidant activity (177.0 +/- 4.3 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of fruit), followed by apple, red grape, strawberry, peach, lemon, pear, banana, orange, grapefruit, and pineapple. Antiproliferation activities were also studied in vitro using HepG(2) human liver-cancer cells, and cranberry showed the highest inhibitory effect with an EC(50) of 14.5 +/- 0.5 mg/mL, followed by lemon, apple, strawberry, red grape, banana, grapefruit, and peach. A bioactivity index (BI) for dietary cancer prevention is proposed to provide a new alternative biomarker for future epidemiological studies in dietary cancer prevention and health promotion.","1116.0"
"Introduction and nutritional evaluation of buckwheat sprouts as a new vegetable","","By using the mass production system, we could harvest the buckwheat sprouts that had their pericarps completely removed. As seeding days progressed, monosaccharides in buckwheat sprouts were rapidly increased, while di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides were gradually decreased. Linoleic acid (C18:2) was found to be the major fatty acid of buckwheat sprouts and increased up to 52.1% at 7 days after seeding (DAS), and total unsaturated fatty acid composition was greater than 83%. Free amino acid contents in buckwheat sprouts were almost four-times higher than those of buckwheat seeds. Based on these results, it was concluded that the abundance of lysine, γ-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) and sulfur containing amino acids in buckwheat sprouts provides a high nutritional value as a new vegetable. Rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside), quericitrin (quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside), chlorogenic acid, and two unknown compounds were presented in both buckwheat seeds and sprouts. As seeding days progressed, rutin, quercitrin, and unknown compound B (431 m/z) were notably increased, while chlorogenic acid and unknown compound A (451 m/z) were moderately increased. Among the water-soluble vitamins, vitamin B1 + B6, vitamin C, and two kinds of unidentified compounds were presented in the buckwheat sprouts. Vitamin C contents of buckwheat sprouts were increased and its maximum content (171.5 mg/100 g) was observed at 7 DAS. On the other hand, vitamin B1 + B6 contents were moderately increased. Buckwheat sprouts not only have the soft and slightly crispy texture, and attractive fragrance, but also have abundant nutrients.","1117.0"
"Effect of heat processing of spices on the concentrations of their bioactive principles: turmeric (Curcuma longa), red pepper (Capsicum annuum) and black pepper (Piper nigrum)","","Studies were made to examine the loss of curcumin, capsaicin and piperine, the active principles of turmeric (Curcuma longa), red pepper (Capsicum annuum) and black pepper (Piper nigrum), respectively, as a result of subjecting the spices to domestic cooking processes. This involved heat treatment of each of these spices by: (i) boiling for 10 min, (ii) boiling for 20 min and (iii) pressure cooking for 10 min. Quantitation of the spice principles in the organic solvent extracts of the freeze-dried cooked spice samples was made with an appropriate HPLC method. Significant loss of spice active principles was observed when the spices were subjected to heat processing. Curcumin loss from heat processing of turmeric was 27-53%, with maximum loss in pressure cooking for 10 min. Curcumin loss from turmeric was similar even in the presence of red gram. In the presence of tamarind, the loss of Curcumin from turmeric was 12-30%. Capsaicin losses from red pepper ranged from 18% to 36%, with maximum loss observed in pressure cooking. Presence of either red gram or tamarind or both did not influence the loss of capsaicin. Piperine losses from black pepper ranged from 16% to 34%, with maximum loss observed in pressure cooking. The loss was somewhat lower in the presence of red gram. The results of this investigation indicated diminished availability of spice active principles from cooked foods when the food ingredients have been subjected to either boiling or pressure cooking for few minutes.","1118.0"
"Comparative study of catechin compositions in five Japanese persimmons (Diospyros kaki)","","In order to study catechin compositions in five Japanese persimmons: Hiratanenashi (HN), Tone-wase (TW), Ishibashi-wase (IW), Maekawa-jiro (MJ) and Matsumoto-wase-fuyu (MF), the contents of epigallocatechin (EGC), catechin (C), and epicatechin (EC) were determined. Total phenolic contents were also determined for the studies of the catechin composition. Identification and quantification of the catechins were performed by HPLC. The EGC contents in three astringent persimmons (HN, TW and IW) were higher than those of two non-astringent persimmons (MJ and MF). The EGC content in HN (astringent) was the highest among the five Japanese persimmons. The EGC content in MF (non-astringent) was the lowest among the five Japanese persimmons. Therefore, astringent persimmons may be better sources of the natural antioxidant, EGC, than non-astringent persimmons, and HN (astringent) may be the best source of EGC among the five Japanese persimmons. This is the first comparative study of catechin compositions in five Japanese persimmons.","1119.0"

"The antioxidant capacity of cocoa products: contribution to the Spanish diet","","Chocolate and soluble cocoa powders are dietary sources of antioxidants. The literature reports antioxidant capacity (AC) derived from aqueous-organic extracts of cocoa polyphenols; however, the residue of these extracts contains appreciable amounts of nonextractable polyphenols (condensed tannins or proanthocyanidins), which may become bioactive antioxidants after colonic fermentation. The objective of this work was to determine the total AC of cocoa products including both extractable and nonextractable polyphenols. Three methods were used: ferric reducing/antioxidant power, 2,2,-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) cations' free-radical scavenging capacity. With this last method, AC ranged from 42 to 79 and from 22 to 60 μmol Trolox per gram of sample for extractable and nonextractable polyphenols, respectively. Addition of milk reduces the AC of cocoa products by about 30%. On the other hand, it was estimated that cocoa products account for about 10% of the total AC of the Spanish diet.","1122.0"

"Anthocyanin metabolism in rats and their distribution to digestive area, kidney, and brain","15884815.0","Anthocyanins are present in human diet due to their wide occurrence in fruits and beverages. They possess antioxidant activities and could be involved in several health effects. The aim of this study was to investigate anthocyanin metabolism and distribution in the digestive area organs (stomach, jejunum and liver) and kidney, as well as a target tissue (brain) in rats fed with a blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) anthocyanin-enriched diet for 15 days. Identification and quantification of anthocyanin metabolites was carried out by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS and HPLC-DAD, respectively. The stomach exhibited only native blackberry anthocyanins (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside and cyanidin 3-O-pentose), while in other organs (jejunum, liver, and kidney) native and methylated anthocyanins as well as conjugated anthocyanidins (cyanidin and peonidin monoglucuronides) were identified. Proportions of anthocyanin derivatives differed according to the organ considered, with the liver presenting the highest proportion of methylated forms. Jejunum and plasma also contained aglycone forms. In the brain, total anthocyanin content (blackberry anthocyanins and peonidin 3-O-glucoside) reached 0.25 +/- 0.05 nmol/g of tissue (n = 6). The urinary excretion of total anthocyanins was low (0.19 +/- 0.02% of the ingested amount). Thus, organs of the digestive area indicated a metabolic pathway of anthocyanins with enzymatic conversions (methylation and/or glucurono-conjugation). Moreover, following consumption of an anthocyanin-rich diet, anthocyanins enter the brain.","1124.0"
"Chemical and sensory quality of processed carrot puree as influenced by stress-induced phenolic compounds","10563981.0","Physicochemical analysis of processed strained product was performed on 10 carrot genotypes grown in Texas (TX) and Georgia (GA). Carrots from GA experienced hail damage during growth, resulting in damage to their tops. Measurements included pH, moisture, soluble phenolics, total carotenoids, sugars, organic acids, and isocoumarin (6-MM). Sensory analysis was conducted using a trained panel to evaluate relationships between chemical and sensory attributes of the genotypes and in carrots spiked with increasing levels of 6-MM. Preharvest stress conditions in GA carrots seemed to elicit a phytoalexic response, producing compounds that impacted the perception of bitter and sour flavors. Spiking 6-MM into strained carrots demonstrated the role bitter compounds have in lowering sweetness scores while increasing the perception of sour flavor. Screening fresh carrots for the phytoalexin 6-MM has the potential to significantly improve the sensory quality of processed products.","1125.0"

"Ripening associated phytochemical changes in mangos (Mangifera indica) following thermal quarantine and low-temperature storage","","Fresh mangos entering the United States must be subjected to a thermal quarantine treatment to eliminate invasive pests, commonly followed by cold storage to extend shelf-life. Changes in phytochemicals and their resultant antioxidant capacity after such treatments are unknown. These studies evaluated mature, green mangos subjected to a simulated quarantine treatment using hot water immersion at 50 degrees C for 60 min and subsequent storage at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against their respective controls. Fruit held at 5 degrees C were transferred to 20 degrees C after 8 d of storage to complete ripening, whereby symptoms of chill injury were observed. Phytochemical, antioxidant capacity, and quality parameters were then assessed every 4 d as the fruit ripened over the next 20 d. Storage temperature during ripening and not the hot water treatment was the major factor contributing to changes in polyphenolic content, with antioxidant capacity unaffected by either postharvest treatments or ripening. Major polyphenolics identified were free gallic acid and 4 gallotannins that collectively increased in concentration by 34% as the fruit ripened, also independent of postharvest and storage treatments. Carotenoid concentrations were highest in hot water-treated fruit stored at 20 degrees C, whereas storage at 5 degrees C initially delayed ripening. Despite appreciable differences in fruit quality during quarantine treatment or low temperature storage, only minor differences in antioxidant phytochemicals were observed.","1128.0"
"Gas chromatographic identification of phenolic acids found in sweet cherry and sour cherry juice","","To investigate the characteristic flavor compounds and their differences in commercially available cherry wines, this study employed headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS), headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS), and sensory evaluation techniques to comprehensively analyze the volatile flavor compounds and sensory characteristics of 11 commercial cherry wines. The results showed that HS-SPME-GC-MS and HS-GC-IMS identified 74 and 49 volatile compounds, respectively. The combined use of both techniques detected a total of 101 compounds, identifying 15 additional key compounds compared to a single method, significantly improving the comprehensiveness of flavor characterization. Through odor activity value (OAV), relative odor activity value (ROAV), and variable importance in projection (VIP), 28 key flavor compounds were screened. Among them, esters (such as ethyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, and ethyl octanoate) and alcohols (such as phenethyl alcohol) were the main contributors to the fruity and floral aroma of cherry wines, while benzaldehyde and 3-furfural were significantly associated with woody characteristics. Sensory evaluation indicated that sample C<sub>10</sub> received the highest overall score, exhibiting prominent floral and fruity notes. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis further confirmed that the floral and fruity attributes were strongly positively correlated with compounds such as linalool and α-terpineol, while the woody attribute was closely associated with benzaldehyde. Based on volatile compound fingerprinting and principal component analysis (PCA), samples C<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>9</sub>, and C<sub>10</sub> exhibited similar flavor profiles with notable floral and fruity characteristics, whereas C<sub>11</sub> displayed a unique woody character due to its high benzaldehyde content. This study provides a theoretical basis and data support for improving the flavor quality and differentiated quality control of cherry wine.","1129.0"

"Curcumin content of turmeric and curry powders","17044766.0","Curcumin, derived from the rhizome curcuma longa, is one of the primary ingredients in turmeric and curry powders that are used as spices in Middle Eastern and Asian countries, especially on the Indian subcontinent. More recently, laboratory studies have demonstrated that dietary curcumin exhibits various biological activities and significantly inhibits colon tumorigenesis and tumor size in animals. Curcumin displays both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, giving it the potential to be considered in the development of cancer preventive strategies and applications in clinical research. Experimental studies have shown the biological activities of the compound, but much more information on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and food content are needed. Whether the amount of curcumin in turmeric and curry powders is sufficient to suggest effects on biological activities and cancer risk is unknown. To determine and compare the quantitative amounts of curcumin that are present in several brands of turmeric and curry powders, a high performance liquid chromatography technique was used to analyze 28 spice products described as turmeric or curry powders and two negative controls. Pure turmeric powder had the highest curcumin concentration, averaging 3.14% by weight. The curry powder samples, with one exception, had relatively small amounts of curcumin present, and the variability in content was great. The curcumin content of these seasoning products that are consumed as a component of the diet should be considered in evaluating baseline tissue concentration and response to curcumin supplementation, which is under study in chemoprevention trials.","1132.0"

"Wine phenolics: contribution to dietary intake and bioavailability","","<b>Background and Objectives:</b> Anthocyanin-rich barley varieties have recently gained attention due to their high (poly)phenolic content and potential health benefits, yet human data on their bioavailability remain scarce. This study aimed to characterize the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of (poly)phenolic compounds from a novel hull-less purple whole-grain barley (WGB) genotype. <b>Methods:</b> Eleven healthy volunteers consumed 140 g of purple WGB biscuits, and plasma and urine samples were collected over 6 h and 48 h, respectively. <b>Results:</b> UPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed a broad range of metabolites, with 11 (poly)phenolic compounds identified in plasma and 80 in urine. The biscuits were particularly rich in flavones (217 mg/140 g, mainly chrysoeriol derivatives), followed by hydroxycinnamic acids (~54 mg, mainly 4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxycinnamic acid), anthocyanins (44.8 mg), and flavan-3-ols (16.8 mg). In plasma, glycosylated anthocyanins and flavone conjugates (e.g., peonidin-3-O-glucuronide, chrysoeriol-<i>O</i>-glucuronide) were detectable within 1-2 h, consistent with early absorption. In contrast, microbial-derived catabolites-including valerolactones, phenylacetic and benzoic acids-were mainly excreted in urine between 8 and 24 h, reaching concentrations above 1000 nM. <b>Conclusions:</b> These findings provide novel insights into the bioavailability and metabolic fate of barley (poly)phenols, supporting their potential contribution to host and gut health. As a proof-of-concept study, it complements the limited data available from pigmented cereals and underscores the need for validation in larger cohorts.","1134.0"
"Composition of anthocyanin pigments in aromatic red rice and its wine","","Colored highland barley is a promising nutrient-rich functional food. However, antioxidant capacity after fermentation and the quality of the resulting wine remain unexplored. This study investigated how the accumulation of non-volatile metabolites in four fermented colored highland barley varieties influences antioxidant capacity and wine quality. Comprehensive metabolomic analysis identified 1602 distinct non-volatile metabolites, with 486, 229, and 392 showing differential accumulation in black, purple, and blue varieties, respectively, compared with the yellow variety. Key differentially accumulated metabolites were enriched in flavonoid, flavone, flavonol, and anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways, significantly influencing antioxidant capacity. Interactions among glucose, organic acids, and metabolites contributed to the unique flavor of highland barley wine. Differences in physicochemical characteristics and flavor compounds offer consumers a diverse selection of highland barley wines.

"Phytoestrogen content of foods consumed in Canada, including isoflavones, lignans, and coumestan","16898863.0","Phytoestrogens may play a role in hormone-related diseases such as cancer, but epidemiological and clinical data are conflicting in part due to inadequate databases used in intake estimation. A database of nine phytoestrogens in foods relevant to Western diets was developed to more accurately estimate intakes. Foods (N = 121) available in Ontario, Canada were prepared as commonly consumed and analyzed for isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, formononetin), lignans (secoisolariciresinol, matairesinol, pinoresinol, lariciresinol), and coumestan (coumestrol) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Data were presented on an as is (wet) basis per 100 g and per serving. Food groups with decreasing levels of total phytoestrogens per 100 g are nuts and oilseeds, soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. Soy products contain the highest amounts of isoflavone, followed by legumes, meat products and other processed foods, cereals and breads, nuts and oilseeds, vegetables, alcoholic beverages, fruits, and nonalcoholic beverages. Decreasing amounts of lignans are found in nuts and oilseeds, cereals and breads, legumes, fruits, vegetables, soy products, processed foods, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. The richest sources of specific phytoestrogens, including coumestrol, were identified.

"Effect of different organic growing conditions on quality of cooked potatoes","","In 1997 and 1998 the effect of six different organic treatments on the chemical, rheological and sensory quality of cooked potatoes was investigated. Cattle slurry and cattle deep litter were each applied to sandy soil in three ways. The type of manure applied gave the most distinct effect on sensory quality. Manuring with slurry decreased dry matter, starch and phytic acid and increased N and rheological properties (modulus of deformability, stress, strain) significantly compared with deep litter manuring. Maturity of tubers was assumed to be the main cause of these differences. Regarding the sensory quality of potatoes, minor differences were found among the organic treatments investigated. Potatoes manured with slurry were slightly moister and seemed to have higher discolouration and off-odour and lower yellowness than potatoes manured with deep litter. Mealiness was highest when composted deep litter was ploughed in and lowest when deep litter and straw were ploughed in. The observed differences in sensory quality are presumably an effect of availability of N in the manure. Chlorogenic acid was the only phenolic acid that was affected by the organic treatments. The variation in phenolic acid and scopoletin contents did not seem to influence the off-taste of potatoes. As the sensory quality of potatoes produced by different organic treatments had not been addressed previously, this study revealed interesting results.","1137.0"
"Urinary excretion of black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis) anthocyanins and their metabolites","16478275.0","Anthocyanins are the most abundant phenolic compounds, widely distributed in fruits and vegetables, and exhibit potent antioxidant capacity. Humans ingest a significant amount of anthocyanins in the daily diet. The objective of the current study was to examine human absorption and metabolism of black raspberry anthocyanins when administered at high doses (2.69 +/- 0.085 g/day). Ten healthy men consumed 45 g of freeze-dried black raspberries daily for 1 week. Urine samples were collected over a 12 h period in 4 h intervals at day 1 and day 7. Urinary anthocyanins were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector and a tandem mass spectrometer using precursor ion and product ion analyses.

"Antioxidant activities of buckwheat extracts","","This work investigated the kinetics effect and the inhibition mechanism of acrylamide (AA) formation by adding Tartary buckwheat extracts from Tartary buckwheat seeds (TB) and Tartary buckwheat sprouts (TBS) in the asparagine-glucose reaction system. TBS exhibited greater inhibitory activity against AA than TB, demonstrating inhibition rates of 47.95 % and 32.13 % at 1 mg/mL, respectively. Rutin, the main polyphenol of extracts, achieved the highest inhibition rate (64.69 %) at 10<sup>-9</sup> mol/L. The Logistic-Exponential kinetic model was well fitted to the kinetic changes of AA in this study. In addition, the kinetics change of reaction products and oxidation-reduction potential indicated that Tartary buckwheat extracts and rutin might mitigate AA through three paths: 1) decrease the conversion of 3-aminopropionamide (3-APA) to AA, 2) reduce the formation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), 3) enhance the elimination of AA by increasing the positive voltage of the model system.","1139.0"

"Distinguishing organic wines from normal wines on the basis of concentrations of phenolic compounds and spectral data","","The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of location on the composition and quality of wines from the viticultural zone PGI Drama. Grapes from two white (Sauvignon blanc, Assyrtiko) and three red varieties (Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Agiorgitiko) were collected from nine locations within the zone during 2022. The vineyards span distances ranging from several hundred meters to 100 km, and their altitudes vary from 90 to nearly 820 m. Vinification was performed following the same protocol according to the type of wine. Wines were analyzed for quality parameters such as pH, total acidity, alcohol, and residual sugar content. In addition, elemental composition, phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and sensory attributes of the wines were assessed. The obtained results suggested that besides the type of wine and variety, the location significantly affects the quality parameters of the wine. PCA analysis revealed that location is an important factor affecting the wine quality. The areas north and northwest proved more suitable for specific varieties, as they produce wines with more distinct organoleptic characteristics. The results provide insights into the behavior of international and native varieties in the face of global warming and assist in decisions concerning the most suitable plant material.","1141.0"

"HPLC-DAD-ESIMS analysis of phenolic compounds in nectarines, peaches, and plums","11600017.0","The phenolic compounds of 25 peach, nectarine, and plum cultivars were studied and quantified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS. Hydroxycinnamates, procyanidins, flavonols, and anthocyanins were detected and quantified. White and yellow flesh nectarines and peaches, and yellow and red plums, were analyzed at two different maturity stages with consideration of both peel and flesh tissues. HPLC-MS analyses allowed the identification of procyanidin dimers of the B- and A-types, as well as the presence of procyanidin trimers in plums. As a general rule, the peel tissues contained higher amounts of phenolics, and anthocyanins and flavonols were almost exclusively located in this tissue. No clear differences in the phenolic content of nectarines and peaches were detected or between white flesh and yellow flesh cultivars. There was no clear trend in phenolic content with ripening of the different cultivars. Some cultivars, however, had a very high phenolic content. For example, the white flesh nectarine cultivar Brite Pearl (350-460 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 430-550 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and the yellow flesh cv. Red Jim (180-190 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 210-330 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh), contained 10 times more phenolics than cultivars such as Fire Pearl (38-50 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 23-30 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh). Among white flesh peaches, cultivars Snow King (300-320 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 660-695 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) and Snow Giant (125-130 mg/kg hydroxycinnamates and 520-540 mg/kg procyanidins in flesh) showed the highest content. The plum cultivars Black Beaut and Angeleno were especially rich in phenolics.","1147.0"
"A new process to develop a cocoa powder with higher flavonoid monomer content and enhanced bioavailability in healthy humans","17439235.0","Cocoa is a food rich in polyphenols, mainly the flavonoid procyanidins and flavan-3-ols. The improvement of the cardiovascular function in humans upon cocoa consumption has been specifically linked to the presence of flavan-3-ol derived metabolites in plasma, especially epicatechin glucuronide. In this context, a flavonoid-enriched cocoa-derived product could potentially exert stronger health benefits. The aim of the present study was to obtain a cocoa powder with a higher flavonoid content (mainly enriched in monomer compounds) and assess its flavonoid bioavailability in humans. For this purpose, an unfermented, nonroasted, and blanch-treated cocoa powder (A) was obtained. The powder contained four times more procyanidins than a conventional (B) cocoa powder. Powder A contained eight times more epicatechin and procyanidin B2 than powder B. Cocoa milk drinks were prepared with powder A (MDA) and B (MDB). The bioavailability of flavonoids in both drinks was assessed in a crossover intervention with healthy volunteers. The content of epicatechin glucuronide, the main metabolite detected in plasma, was five-fold higher upon consumption of MDA as compared with MDB. The urinary excretion of metabolites, mainly methyl epicatechin sulfate, was higher upon MDA consumption as compared with MDB, ranging from two- to 12-fold higher depending on the metabolite. These results, together with previous reports regarding the cardiovascular benefits linked to the presence of procyanidin metabolites in plasma, suggest that further clinical trials to validate the health benefits of a flavonoid-enriched cocoa powder are warranted.","1148.0"
"Seasonal variations in the antioxidant composition of greenhouse grown tomatoes","","<h4>Background</h4>Tomatoes have full of nutritional value as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. It contains substances such as lycopene and micronutrients that are beneficial to human health. Tomato consumption has been associated with reduced mortality, but the role of seasonal intake is not well understood. To address this gap, we investigated the association between in-season and off-season tomato consumption and all-cause as well as cardio-cerebrovascular mortality.<h4>Methods</h4>This prospective study enrolled 6,260 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The endpoint events were all-cause and cardio-cerebrovascular mortality within 10 years. Cox proportional hazards analyses and competing risk modeling were employed to evaluate the influences of total and seasonal tomato consumption. Further studies were conducted on the relationship between lycopene intake and all-cause and cardio-cerebrovascular mortality over 10 years.<h4>Results</h4>Fresh tomato consumption was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.87, <i>P</i> = 0.005). Moderate in-season consumption (once a week to once a day) was linked to a further reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24-0.95, <i>P</i> = 0.034). Conversely, off-season consumption was associated with decreased cardio-cerebrovascular mortality (subhazard ratio [SHE] = 0.43, 95%CI: 0.23-0.79, <i>P</i> = 0.006). Moderate ketchup intake (< 1 time/day) lowered both all-cause and cardio-cerebrovascular mortality, whereas tomato juice conferred no significant survival benefit, and higher daily consumption may negate potential advantages. Elevated total and trans lycopene concentrations were also correlated with reduced mortality risks.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Tomato consumption in different seasons shows different results with mortality: in-season intake corresponds to decreased all-cause mortality, whereas off-season intake is related to a lower risk of cardio-cerebrovascular mortality. These findings underscore the importance of considering seasonal dietary patterns in nutritional recommendations.","1149.0"

"The effects of genotype and extraction methods on chemical composition of virgin olive oils from Traslasierra Valley (Cordoba, Argentina)","","This work was carried out to assess the influence of two extraction methods (two-phase centrifugation and pressure) on oil quality from four olive varieties cultivated at Traslasierra Valley, Cordoba, Argentina. Analysis of the effect of the extraction system, on the values of analytical determinations, revealed statistically significant differences in some parameters, mainly in free fatty acid and phenol contents, and K270 values. Oxidative stability showed a significant positive correlation with phenol content. Most of the quality indices and fatty acid compositions showed significant variations among olive varieties. Nevadillo variety had the highest values of oleic acid, whereas Manzanilla was noteworthy for its higher content of phenolic compounds. Accordingly, pressure-extracted oil from the Manzanilla variety presented better oxidative stability.","1151.0"
"Chemical composition of Arbequina virgin olive oil in relation to extraction and storgae conditions","","The chemical composition of virgin olive oils from Arbequina olives cultivated in Córdoba (Argentina) was studied in relation to the oil extraction system and production year. Significant variations were found between oils obtained by pressure (PEOs) and centrifugation (CEOs) systems. PEOs were characterised by higher values of acidity, pigments and oleic acid, while CEOs showed greater phenol content. Moreover, a significant effect of crop year was observed. Arbequina oils produced in Córdoba contained lower amounts of oleic acid but higher amounts of phenolic compounds than Arbequina oils produced in Spain. A storage stability test was carried out in order to study the combined effects of oil extraction system and storage conditions (packaging material and illumination) on quality indices related to oxidative stability. Multivariate analysis applied to the chemical data emphasised the differences between PEOs and CEOs, indicating that variations due to extraction system were greater than those due to illumination condition and package type. Cluster analysis of oils from each extraction system stressed the influence of illumination condition on the oxidative stability of olive oils, showing increased amounts of secondary oxidation products in oils exposed to light. Glass and tin packages appear to be the most appropriate containers for maintaining the quality of olive oils, but this supposition is strongly dependent on the type of oil (PEO or CEO) and its initial chemical properties.","1152.0"
"Chronic dietary intake of plant-derived anthocyanins protects the rat heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury","18356330.0","Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages is thought to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Whereas the biological activities of flavonoids have been characterized in vitro, there are no clear experimental data demonstrating that chronic dietary intake and intestinal absorption of flavonoids actually protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. We tested whether long-term consumption of specific flavonoids (anthocyanins) included in normal food could render the heart of rats more resistant to myocardial infarction. Maize kernels that differed specifically in their accumulation of anthocyanins were used to prepare rodent food in which anthocyanins were either present or absent. Male Wistar rats were fed the anthocyanin-rich (ACN-rich) or the anthocyanin-free (ACN-free) diet for a period of 8 wk. Anthocyanins were significantly absorbed and detected in the blood and urine of only rats fed the ACN-rich diet. In Langendorff preparations, the hearts of rats fed the ACN-rich diet were more resistant to regional ischemia and reperfusion insult. Moreover, on an in vivo model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion, infarct size was reduced in rats that ate the ACN-rich diet than in those that consumed the ACN-free diet (P < 0.01). Cardioprotection was associated with increased myocardial glutathione levels, suggesting that dietary anthocyanins might modulate cardiac antioxidant defenses. Our findings suggest important potential health benefits of foods rich in anthocyanins and emphasize the need to develop anthocyanin-rich functional foods with protective activities for promoting human health.","1153.0"
"Effect of grain pre-treatment on different extractable phenolic groups in cereals and legumes commonly consumed in Tanzania","","Extractable phenolic compounds, classified as total phenolics, resorcinols, catechols and galloyls, were determined in cereals and legume food grains commonly consumed in Tanzania, using various colorimetric methods. Grain samples of red sorghum (udo), finger millet, cowpea, mung bean and brown kidney bean were further processed-soaked in water at different pHs, germinated, cooked or dehulled (legumes only)-and the effect on extractable phenolics was analysed. In untreated grains, total phenolics ranged from 0.9 to 33.7, catechols from 0.8 to 13.5 and resorcinols from 0.2 to 11 mg catechin equivalents (CE) g(-1). Galloyls (tannic acid equivalents, TAE) were found in negligible amounts in most grains, but in appreciable amounts in red sorghum (5.5 mg g(-1)). Processing of grains led to variable effects on the extractable phenolics. Soaking the grains significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the amount of total extractable phenolics in red sorghum, finger millet and cowpea, with alkali and acidic media being more effective. Water soaking had no effect on total extractable phenolics in mung bean and water, while alkali and acidic soaking had no effect on total extractable phenolics in brown kidney bean. Extractable catechols and resorcinols were affected by soaking in a similar pattern to total extractable phenolics. Germination reduced total extractable phenolics, catechols and resorcinols in all samples, except for catechols in mung bean. Cooking (boiling of grains) was more effective in reducing total extractable phenolics in cereals than germination and water soaking, while dehulling was the most effective method for reducing total extractable phenolics in legumes (p < 0.01).","1154.0"

"A study of the effect of roasting on the chlorogenic acid composition of coffee using HPLC","","Coffee silverskin (CS), the principal solid by-product from coffee roasting, is a promising raw material for sustainable food applications aligned with circular economy principles. Due to its high flammability at roasting temperatures, effective management of CS is not only an environmental but also a safety concern in coffee processing facilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the chemical composition, bioactivity, safety, and environmental impact of torrefacto (CT) and natural (CN) coffee silverskin. CT (from Arabica-Robusta blends subjected to sugar-glazing) and CN (from 100% Arabica) were characterized in terms of composition and function. Oven-dried CT showed higher levels of caffeine (13.2 ± 0.6 mg/g vs. 8.7 ± 0.7 mg/g for CN), chlorogenic acid (1.34 ± 0.08 mg/g vs. 0.92 ± 0.06 mg/g), protein (18.1 ± 0.2% vs. 16.7 ± 0.2%), and melanoidins (14.9 ± 0.3 mg/g vs. 9.6 ± 0.2 mg/g), but CN yielded more total phenolics (13.8 ± 0.6 mg GAE/g). Both types exhibited strong antioxidant capacity (ABTS: 48.9-59.2 µmol TE/g), and all oven-dried samples met food safety criteria (microbial loads below 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/g, moisture 7.9%). Oven drying was identified as the most industrially viable, ensuring preservation of bioactives and resulting in a 19% lower greenhouse gas emissions impact compared to freeze-drying. Sun drying was less reliable microbiologically. The valorization of oven-dried CT as a clean-label, antioxidant-rich colorant offers clear potential for food reformulation and waste reduction. Renewable energy use during drying is recommended to further enhance sustainability. This study provides scientific evidence to support the safe use of coffee silverskin as a novel food, contributing to regulatory assessment and sustainable food innovation aligned with SDGs 9, 12, and 13.","1156.0"

"The absorption, metabolism and excretion of flavan-3-ols and procyanidins following the ingestion of a grape seed extract by rats","16115350.0","Rats were fed a grape seed extract (GSE) containing (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and dimers, trimers, tetramers and polymeric procyanidins. Liver, kidney, brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract together with plasma, urine and faeces were collected over a 24 h period and their flavan-3-ol content was analysed by HPLC with tandem mass spectrometry and diode array detection. Small amounts of the GSE flavan-3-ols moved out of the stomach and into the duodenum/jejunum, and to a greater extent the ileum 1 h after ingestion, and into the caecum after 2 h with relatively small amounts being detected in the colon after 3 h. The GI tract contained the parent GSE flavan-3-ols and procyanidins with only trace amounts of metabolites and there were no indications that proanthocyanidins were depolymerised in the GI tract releasing monomeric flavan-3-ols. Plasma contained exclusively catechin glucuronides and methylated glucuronide metabolites which were also detected in the liver and kidneys. These metabolites were also present in urine together with sulphated metabolites and low amounts of the procyanidin dimers B1, B2, B3 and B4 as well as the trimer C2 and an unknown GSE trimer. The amounts of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin metabolites excreted in urine relative to the quantity of the monomers ingested were 27 and 36 %, respectively, after 24 h. This is similar to the levels of urinary excretion reported to occur by other investigators after feeding (-)-epicatechin to rats and provides further, albeit indirect, evidence that the procyanidin oligomers in the GSE were not depolymerised to monomers to any extent after ingestion. No convincing analytical data were obtained for the presence of flavan-3-ol metabolites in the brain.","1159.0"
"Free and conjugated myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol in Bulgarian red wines","","The moderate consumption of red wines is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and cancer. It is well known that red wines are a rich source of flavonoids, especially of flavonols. The data on flavonol content in Bulgarian food and beverages are extremely rare. Eleven red wines traditionally consumed in Bulgaria were analyzed for free and conjugated flavonols: myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol. They were determined before and after acid hydrolysis using RP-HPLC with UV detection. The results show that Gamza wines have very low flavonol level (< 1.0-4.0 mg/L). The total flavonol content for Merlot wines was 5.3-13.9 mg/L; for Cabernet Sauvignon wines, 9.3-13 mg/L; and for the Mavrud wine 14.8 mg/L. The maximum flavonol content was found in Melnik wines (12.2-16.9 mg/L). The results were compared with data from other surveys and will be included in the National Database of Food Composition.","1160.0"
"Polyphenolic profiles in eight apple cultivars using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)","14518966.0","Polyphenolic compounds of apple may play an important role in physiologic functions related to human health. Different polyphenolics may have varied biological activities including antioxidant activity. The objective of this study was to investigate the profiles of polyphenolic compounds in different apple varieties and different parts of an apple. The total and individual polyphenolics differed significantly among the eight apple cultivars grown in Ontario, and the peels had higher concentrations than the flesh. Among the tested cultivars, Red Delicious and Northern Spy had the highest concentrations and Empire the lowest. Five major polyphenolic groups with a total of 16 identified individual compounds were found, among which the dihydroxycinnamic acid esters, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found in both flesh and peel, whereas quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively found in the peel. Cyanidin 3-galactoside was unique to and found only in red apple peels. In both apple peel and flesh, the predominant group of polyphenolics was the procyanidins, followed by quercetin glycosides in the peel and hydroxycinnamic acid esters in the flesh. 3-Hydroxyphloretin 2'-xyloglucoside was newly identified in apple. The results obtained in this study will further the understanding of the polyphenolic composition of apples and their roles in health-promoting physiological functions.","1161.0"
"Absorption and metabolism of cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside in rats","10338127.0","We have clarified for the first time how cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (C3G), which is a potent antioxidant anthocyanin, is absorbed and metabolized in vivo. Rats were orally administered C3G (0.9 mmol/kg body weight), and C3G rapidly appeared in the plasma. However, the aglycon of C3G (cyanidin; Cy) was not detected, although it was present in the jejunum. Protocatechuic acid (PC), which may be produced by degradation of Cy, was present in the plasma and the concentration was 8-fold higher than that of C3G. These results suggest that plasma PC and C3G may contribute to the antioxidant activity of the plasma. In the liver and kidney, C3G was metabolized to methylated C3G (methyl-C3G), suggesting that C3G and/or methyl-C3G act as antioxidants in the tissues.","1162.0"
"Flavonoid in fruits and vegetables. II. Content of flavonol glucosides and some properties of enzymes metabolizing the glucosides in onion","","<h4>Background</h4>Flavonoids that are widely distributed across various plant species exhibit significant anticancer activity in various preclinical and clinical studies, thus offering promising therapeutic prospects. However, a thorough understanding of their pharmacokinetic properties, drug-likeness characteristics, and safety profile is essential for the translational applicability of these molecules into clinical settings.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic search was carried out using various electronic databases such as PubMed Central, ScienceDirect, Clinical Registry, and Google Scholar, using different keywords like ""flavonoids"", ""cancer"", ""pharmacokinetics"", ""toxicity"", ""tumor"", and their combinations. Non-English literature was excluded due to language barriers, limited accessibility, non-indexing, and the risk of misinterpreting methods or results, which could compromise the accuracy and reliability of the review.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>This review provides an in-depth overview of various mechanistic pathways, such as oxidative stress-mediated and immunomodulatory pathways, that are considered to be responsible for the anti-cancer potential of flavonoids. In addition, the pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity profile of flavonoids have been discussed, which are the crucial factors in their clinical translation. Lastly, the review briefly explores various strategies that can be adopted to improve the effectiveness of flavonoids in the treatment of cancer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This investigation enhances our understanding of the translational potential of flavonoid-based therapies by highlighting these essential elements, bringing us one step closer to the development of effective and safe cancer treatments.","1163.0"
"Determination of antioxidant compounds and antioxidant activity in commercial oilseeds for food use","","Different commercial edible oilseed samples were analyzed in order to evaluate the compounds involved in antioxidant activity. Fatty acids, triacylglycerols, tocopherols, chlorophylls, β-carotene, squalene, phenolic compounds and CIE L*a*b* coordinates were assayed. Strong chemical variability depending on the oilseed variety was observed. Antioxidant activity was evaluated for the oils, both for their methanol-soluble phase and the fraction insoluble in methanol. DPPH radical scavenging activity expressed in TEAC ranged between 0.45 and 2.30 mmol/l in peanut and maize oils, respectively. Free radical scavenging activity was mainly influenced by tocopherols content (r = +0.70) in oils and polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = +0.61) in the fraction nonsoluble in methanol. Variability of the correlation between the antioxidant activity and the composition of the oilseeds could be attributed to the differences in the squalene, chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phenols contents of the oils and their mutual interactions.","1164.0"
"Structural characterization of the metabolites of hydroxytyrosol, the principal phenolic component in olive oil, in rats","11929304.0","Hydroxytyrosol is quantitatively and qualitatively the principal phenolic antioxidant in olive oil. Recently it was shown that hydroxytyrosol and five metabolites were excreted in urine when hydroxytyrosol was dosed intravenously or orally in an olive oil solution to rats. The conclusive identification of three metabolites of hydroxytyrosol by MS/MS as a monosulfate conjugate, a 3-O-glucuronide conjugate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (homovanillic acid) has been established in this investigation. The structural configurations of the glucuronide conjugate and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid were confirmed by (1)H NMR. The radical scavenging potencies of homovanillic acid, homovanillic alcohol, hydroxytyrosol, and the metabolites were examined with the radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl. These studies showed them to be potent antioxidants with SC(50) values of 14.8 and 11.4 microM for homovanillic acid and homovanillic alcohol, respectively. The 3-O-glucuronide conjugate was more potent than hydroxytyrosol, with an SC(50) of 2.3 in comparison to 11.0 microM, and the monosulfate conjugate was almost devoid of radical scavenging activity.","1165.0"
"Induction of antioxidant flavonol biosynthesis in fresh-cut potatoes. Effect of domestic cooking","12358461.0","The effect of fresh-cutting and subsequent cold storage on phenolic compounds from five long-term-stored potato cultivars (Agria, Cara, Liseta, Monalisa, and Spunta) was studied. Fresh-cutting induced the biosynthesis of three flavonols, which were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESIMS as quercetin 3-rutinoside, quercetin 3-diglucoside, and quercetin 3-glucosylrutinoside. The flavonols were detected after a lag period of 3 days of cold storage. The content ranged from 6 to 14 mg/100 g of fresh weight depending on the cultivar after 6 days of storage. Chlorogenic acid as the main caffeic acid derivative and the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan were also quantified. The effect of cold storage under light or in dark was studied with new-season-harvested Monalisa potatoes. The flavonol induction was higher in fresh-cut potatoes stored under light than in the dark. However, caffeic acid derivatives were not affected. Domestic cooking such as boiling, microwaving, and frying provoked a partial loss of the flavonols, which were retained in the range of 4-16 mg per serving (213 g). Steam-cooking resulted in the highest retention of caffeic acid derivatives and aromatic amino acids compared with the other cooking methods studied. This means that due to the large amount of potatoes consumed in the Western diet, fresh-cut potatoes can be a significant source of health-promoting phenolics.","1166.0"

"Isoflavone content of foods with soy additives","","The health effects of consumption of isoflavones from soy products are being actively investigated, yet food composition tables often have incomplete values for commercial foods containing soy additives. Therefore, we analyzed 167 processed and fast foods with soy additives (e.g. isolated soy protein, soy protein concentrate, soy flour, and hydrolyzed soy protein) for the isoflavones daidzein, glycitein, and genistein. Total isoflavones were computed by adding these three isoflavones. Additionally, 12 traditional soybean products were analyzed, including soy flour and Asian condiments made from soybeans. Foods were sampled from food stores and fast-food restaurants in Hawaii. Concentrations of total isoflavones, expressed as aglycones, ranged from not detected (ND, for 49 foods) to 149.9 mg/100 g. Ranges within food groups were: bread and grain products (ND-93.9), gravies and sauces (ND-2.7), meat and poultry products (ND-15.9), meat substitutes (0.3-149.9), nutritional products (0.4-36.5), reduced fat peanut butters (0.1-4.0), seafood products (ND-1.6), and soybean products (2.9-109.3). For 56 foods on our food composition table, we calculated composite isoflavone values reflecting the mean of multiple brands and the proportion of brands containing soy additives. The resulting table now permits more accurate estimates of total isoflavone intakes by participants in our research studies.","1169.0"
"Not applicable","","Microbial foodborne outbreaks are a severe public health challenge in Africa, which bears the highest global burden due to systemic vulnerabilities. Common microbial pathogens contaminate various foods, particularly raw and processed meats, leading to significant morbidity, mortality and economic losses. In this review, data from 31 studies encompassing 42 microbial foodborne outbreaks in Africa were synthesized, analyzed and visualized. Overall, 877 067 of infections and intoxications occurred, with 2064 hospitalizations and 2061 deaths. Salmonella enterica accounted for the most of infections and intoxication (53.6%), while Staphylococcus aureus caused the highest rate of outbreaks (21.4%). Clostridium botulinum was associated with the highest fatality (46.154%), followed by Listeria monocytogenes (20.323%). The implicated food vehicles in the outbreaks included processed meats (38.1%), cereals, legumes and tuber (21.43%), vegetables (9.52%) and seafood (7.14%). The key contributing factors were poor hygiene, inadequate food storage and limited compliance with food safety practices. Addressing critical deficiencies in food safety infrastructure, public awareness and hygiene practices requires enhanced surveillance systems, stricter regulatory frameworks, investment in infrastructure and public education campaigns. Efforts should prioritize the control of prevalent pathogens to mitigate the health and socioeconomic impacts of foodborne illnesses across the continent.","1170.0"

To determine the distribution of isoflavone metabolites in ewe tissues and look for a link with their physiological impact, two ewes were fed a diet containing 50% red clover silage (variety Pawera) for one month with a daily intake of 157.6 mg/kg bw of total isoflavones. Only aglycones were fed due to the fermentation stage of the silage. At the sacrifice, isoflavone metabolites and aglycones were analyzed in blood, liver, kidney, lung, heart, muscle, ovaries, uterus, mammary glands, suprarenal glands, thymus, aorta, thyroid, pituitary gland, cerebellum, olfactory lobes, and brain hemispheres using HPLC-Coularray and LC-MS-MS. The major compounds recovered in tissues were equol and daidzein, present as glucuronides. Kidney concentrations were 10-fold higher than in other tissues. Penetration in brain was very limited. Reproductive organs contained higher concentrations of isoflavones than heart, muscle, or thymus.

An analytical method, based on an optimized 96-well plate solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) for the analysis of 19 phenolic microbial metabolites and monomeric and dimeric flavanols in urine samples, was developed and validated. Human urine samples were obtained before and after ingestion of an acute consumption of 40 g of soluble cocoa powder and rat urines before and after the prolonged administration (2 weeks) of different diets composed of natural cocoa powder. The mean recovery of analytes using the new SPE-LC-MS/MS method ranged from 87% to 109%. Accuracy ranged from 87.5% to 113.8%, and precision met acceptance criteria (<15% relative standard deviation). Procyanidin B2 has been detected and quantified for the first time in human and rat urine after cocoa consumption. Changes in human and rat urinary levels of microbial phenolic acids and flavanols were in the range of 0.001-59.43 nmol/mg creatinine and of 0.004-181.56 nmol/mg creatinine, respectively. Major advantages of the method developed include reduction of laboratory work in the sample preparation step by the use of 96-well SPE plates and the sensitive measurement of a large number of metabolites in a very short run time, which makes it ideal for use in epidemiological studies.","1173.0"
"Profile of plasma and urine metabolites after the intake of almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb] polyphenols in humans","19839583.0","Nut skins are considered to be a rich source of polyphenols and may be partially responsible for the numerous health effects associated with nut consumption. However, more bioavailability studies of nut skin polyphenols are needed to understand the health effects derived from nut consumption. The aim of the present study was to determine the profiles of both phase II and microbial-derived phenolic metabolites in plasma and urine samples before and after the intake of almond skin polyphenols by healthy human subjects (n = 2). Glucuronide, O-methyl glucuronide, sulfate, and O-methyl sulfate derivatives of (epi)catechin, as well as the glucuronide conjugates of naringenin and glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of isorhamnetin, were detected in plasma and urine samples after consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The main microbial-derived metabolites of flavanols, such as 5-(dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(hydroxymethoxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, were also detected in their glucuronide and sulfate forms. In addition, numerous metabolites derived from further microbial degradation of hydroxyphenylvalerolactones, including hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, hydroxybenzoic, and hydroxyhippuric acids, registered major changes in urine after the consumption of almond skin polyphenols. The urinary excretion of these microbial metabolites was estimated to account for a larger proportion of the total polyphenol ingested than phase II metabolites of (epi)catechin, indicating the important role of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of highly polymerized almond skin polyphenols. To the authors' knowledge this study constitutes the most complete report of the absorption of almond skin polyphenols in humans.","1174.0"
"Targeted metabolic profiling of phenolics in urine and plasma after regular consumption of cocoa by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","19671472.0","The biological properties of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) polyphenols are strictly dependent on their bioavailability. A long-term cocoa feeding trial was performed with subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Subjects (n=42) received two sachets of 20 g of cocoa powder/day with 250 mL of skimmed milk each, or only 500 mL/day of skimmed milk, both for two 4-week periods. The phenolic metabolic profile including phase II conjugated metabolites and phenolic acids derived from the intestinal microbiota was determined by LC-MS/MS in both 24-h urine and fasting plasma. The analysis of 24-h urine revealed significant increases of phase II metabolites, including glucuronides and sulfate conjugates of (-)-epicatechin, O-methyl-epicatechin, 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(3'-methoxy-4'-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, after regular cocoa intake. In the case of plasma, only glucuronide conjugates of dihydroxyphenylvalerolactones increased. Regular consumption of cocoa also resulted in a significant increase in the urinary excretion of colonic microbial-derived phenolic metabolites, including vanillic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acids, and particularly 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, whereas only the two latter metabolites showed a significant increase in fasting plasma. The results found herein indicate that 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and hydroxyphenylacetic acids could be good biomarkers of the regular consumption of cocoa and therefore, of flavanol-rich foods.","1175.0"
"Effect of milk on the urinary excretion of microbial phenolic acids after cocoa powder consumption in humans","20222713.0","Health effects of cocoa flavonols depend on their bioavailability, which is strongly influenced by the food matrix and the degree of flavanol polymerization. The effect of milk on the bioavailability of cocoa flavanoids considering phase II metabolites of epicatechin has been the subject of considerable debate. This work studies the effect of milk at the colonic microbial metabolism level of the nonabsorbed flavanol fraction that reaches the colon and is metabolized by the colonic microbiota into various phenolic acids. Twenty-one human volunteers followed a diet low in polyphenols for at least 48 h before taking, in a random order, 40 g of cocoa powder dissolved either in 250 mL of whole milk or in 250 mL of water. Urine samples were collected before the intake and during three different periods (0-6, 6-12, and 12-24 h). Phenolic acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS after solid-phase extraction. Of the 15 metabolites assessed, the excretion of 9 phenolic acids was affected by the intake of milk. The urinary concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, protocatechuic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxyhippuric, hippuric, caffeic, and ferulic acids diminished after the intake of cocoa with milk, whereas urinary concentrations of vanillic and phenylacetic acids increased. In conclusion, milk partially affects the formation of microbial phenolic acids derived from the colonic degradation of procyanidins and other compounds present in cocoa powder.","1176.0"
"Composition of Foods Raw, Processed, Prepared. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 23","","Metabolomics is a postgenomic, systems-based discipline offering valuable applications in nutrition research, including the use of objective biomarkers to characterize dietary intake and metabolic responses more accurately. A scoping review identified the need for reporting guidance on dietary information in the form of a checklist to ensure reproducibility of human feeding studies that are measuring the diet-related metabolome. In this study, we aimed to gain consensus on a core outcome set pertaining to diet-related item details (DIDs) and recommendations for reporting DIDs to inform development of a reporting checklist. The goal of this checklist is to guide researchers on the minimum level of content and detail required for reporting dietary information in human feeding studies measuring the metabolome. A 2-stage online Delphi process encompassing 5 survey rounds with international experts in clinical trial design, feeding study intervention implementation, metabolomics, and/or human biospecimen analyses was conducted. A core outcome set encompassing 29 DIDs and accompanying recommendations was developed across 5 domains: dietary intervention-modeling (8 DIDs), dietary intervention-implementation (3 DIDs), dietary assessment (9 DIDs), adherence and compliance monitoring (4 DIDs), and bias (5 DIDs). The reporting guideline (DID-METAB Checklist) was generated and accepted by the international expert working group in the final survey round. All experts agreed that relevant journals should include the checklist as a suggested reporting tool for relevant studies and/or used alongside existing reporting tools. This report provides examples, explanations and elaboration for each recommendation including examples from published literature and references. The DID-METAB Checklist will be a key tool to advance the standardized reporting for feeding studies assessing the metabolome. Implementation of this tool will enable the ability to better interpret data and ensure global utility of results for furthering the advancement of metabolomics in nutrition research and future precision and personalized nutrition strategies.","1177.0"
"Analysis of vervain flavonoids by HPLC/diode array detector method. Its application to quality control","10552853.0","A reversed-phase HPLC procedure is proposed for the determination of seven flavonoids (luteolin, nepetin, hispidulin, jaceosidin, cirsimaritin, cirsilineol, and eupatorin) in vervain samples. A simple extractive technique was developed, involving only extraction with ethyl ether, which allowed the elimination of phenolic acids, yielding a sufficiently purified flavonoid fraction. All of the analyzed vervain samples showed a common flavonoid pattern, in which hispidulin and jaceosidin were the major compounds and nepetin was the minor compound.","1178.0"
"Potential bioactive compounds in health promotion from broccoli cultivars grown in Spain","","Glucosinolates, phenolic compounds and vitamin C were evaluated in two commercial and 12 experimental cultivars of broccoli (Brassica oleracea L var italica) grown under uniform cultural conditions. The predominant glucosinolates in all broccoli cultivars were 4-methylsulphinylbutyl glucosinolate (glucoraphanin) and 3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate (glucobrassicin). Other glucosinolates such as 4-OH-glucobrassicin and N-methoxyglucobrassicin were detected in lower amounts. The total glucosinolate concentration ranged from 3.0 µmol g−1 dw (dry weight) in Pentathlon (experimental cultivar) to 28.3 µmol g−1 dw in I-9905 (experimental cultivar). Flavonoids, caffeic acid derivatives and sinapic acid derivatives were quantified in methanol extracts. The largest content of flavonoids was found in the commercial cultivars Marathon and Lord, around 60 mg kg−1 fw (fresh weight). The vitamin C content of broccoli ranged from 43.1 mg per 100 g fw in Lord (commercial cultivar) to 146.3 mg per 100 g fw in SG-4515 (experimental cultivar).","1179.0"
"Effect of climatic and sulphur fertilisation conditions, on phenolic compounds and vitamin C, in the inflorescences of eight broccoli cultivars","","The global diversity of fungi has been estimated between 2 to 11 million species, of which only about 155 000 have been named. Most fungi are invisible to the unaided eye, but they represent a major component of biodiversity on our planet, and play essential ecological roles, supporting life as we know it. Although approximately 20 000 fungal genera are presently recognised, the ecology of most remains undetermined. Despite all this diversity, the mycological community actively researches some fungal genera more commonly than others. This poses an interesting question: why have some fungal genera impacted mycology and related fields more than others? To address this issue, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to identify the top 100 most cited fungal genera. A thorough database search of the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed was performed to establish which genera are most cited. The most cited 10 genera are <i>Saccharomyces</i>, <i>Candida</i>, <i>Aspergillus</i>, <i>Fusarium</i>, <i>Penicillium</i>, <i>Trichoderma</i>, <i>Botrytis</i>, <i>Pichia</i>, <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Alternaria</i>. Case studies are presented for the 100 most cited genera with general background, notes on their ecology and economic significance and important research advances. This paper provides a historic overview of scientific research of these genera and the prospect for further research. <b>Citation:</b> Bhunjun CS, Chen YJ, Phukhamsakda C, Boekhout T, Groenewald JZ, McKenzie EHC, Francisco EC, Frisvad JC, Groenewald M, Hurdeal VG, Luangsa-ard J, Perrone G, Visagie CM, Bai FY, Błaszkowski J, Braun U, de Souza FA, de Queiroz MB, Dutta AK, Gonkhom D, Goto BT, Guarnaccia V, Hagen F, Houbraken J, Lachance MA, Li JJ, Luo KY, Magurno F, Mongkolsamrit S, Robert V, Roy N, Tibpromma S, Wanasinghe DN, Wang DQ, Wei DP, Zhao CL, Aiphuk W, Ajayi-Oyetunde O, Arantes TD, Araujo JC, Begerow D, Bakhshi M, Barbosa RN, Behrens FH, Bensch K, Bezerra JDP, Bilański P, Bradley CA, Bubner B, Burgess TI, Buyck B, Čadež N, Cai L, Calaça FJS, Campbell LJ, Chaverri P, Chen YY, Chethana KWT, Coetzee B, Costa MM, Chen Q, Custódio FA, Dai YC, Damm U, de Azevedo Santiago ALCM, De Miccolis Angelini RM, Dijksterhuis J, Dissanayake AJ, Doilom M, Dong W, Alvarez-Duarte E, Fischer M, Gajanayake AJ, Gené J, Gomdola D, Gomes AAM, Hausner G, He MQ, Hou L, Iturrieta-González I, Jami F, Jankowiak R, Jayawardena RS, Kandemir H, Kiss L, Kobmoo N, Kowalski T, Landi L, Lin CG, Liu JK, Liu XB, Loizides M, Luangharn T, Maharachchikumbura SSN, Makhathini Mkhwanazi GJ, Manawasinghe IS, Marin-Felix Y, McTaggart AR, Moreau PA, Morozova OV, Mostert L, Osiewacz HD, Pem D, Phookamsak R, Pollastro S, Pordel A, Poyntner C, Phillips AJL, Phonemany M, Promputtha I, Rathnayaka AR, Rodrigues AM, Romanazzi G, Rothmann L, Salgado-Salazar C, Sandoval-Denis M, Saupe SJ, Scholler M, Scott P, Shivas RG, Silar P, Souza-Motta CM, Silva-Filho AGS, Spies CFJ, Stchigel AM, Sterflinger K, Summerbell RC, Svetasheva TY, Takamatsu S, Theelen B, Theodoro RC, Thines M, Thongklang N, Torres R, Turchetti B, van den Brule T, Wang XW, Wartchow F, Welti S, Wijesinghe SN, Wu F, Xu R, Yang ZL, Yilmaz N, Yurkov A, Zhao L, Zhao RL, Zhou N, Hyde KD, Crous PW (2024).

"Health-promoting compounds in broccoli as influenced by refrigerated transport and retail sale period","12720387.0","Total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates, phenolic compounds (flavonoids and hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives), and vitamin C contents were evaluated in freshly harvested broccoli (Brassica oleracea L., var. italica, cv. Marathon) inflorescences. These were film-wrapped and stored for 7 days at 1 degrees C to simulate a maximum period of commercial transport and distribution. After cold storage, inflorescences were kept for 3 days at 15 degrees C to simulate a retail sale period. For wrapping, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) of 11 microm thickness was used. Gas composition was about 17% O(2) and 2% CO(2) during cold storage and about 16% O(2) and 3-4% CO(2) during shelf life within packages. The predominant glucosinolates were 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate (glucoraphanin), 3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (glucobrassicin), and 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolate (neoglucobrassicin). The predominant hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives were identified as 1,2,2'-trisinapoylgentiobiose, 1,2-diferuloylgentiobiose, 1,2'-disinapoyl-2-feruloylgentiobiose, and 3-O-caffeoyl-quinic (neochlorogenic acid). Results showed major losses at the end of both periods, in comparison with broccoli at harvest. Thus, the respective losses, at the end of cold storage and retail periods, were 71-80% of total glucosinolates, 62-59% of total flavonoids, 51-44% of sinapic acid derivatives, and 73-74% caffeoyl-quinic acid derivatives. Slight differences in all compound concentrations between storage and retail sale periods were detected. Distribution and retail periods had minimal effects on vitamin C. Weight loss was monitored at the end of both periods.","1181.0"
"Concentration and solubility of flavanones in orange beverages affect their bioavailability in humans","20441150.0","Orange juice is a very rich source of dietary flavanones. The effect of flavanone concentration and solubility of orange beverages on their bioavailability has been studied in a crossover study with 10 healthy volunteers. Five different beverages with different flavanone concentrations were evaluated. Commercial orange juices (29.2-70.3 mg of flavanones/100 mL) were compared with experimental orange beverages in which the flavanone concentration was enhanced (110.2 mg/100 mL). Hesperetin and naringenin glucuronides and sulfates were detected and quantified in plasma and urine. The study shows that the solubility of the flavanones, and particularly that of hesperidin, in the juice is a key factor for the bioavailability as flavanone excretion and the C(max) in plasma correlate well with the soluble flavanone concentration in the juice, whereas it has no correlation with the total flavanone intake. In addition, a large interindividual variation was observed, this being consistent for each individual after the intake of the different beverages, suggesting that flavanone bioavailability is also dependent on the occurrence of specific microbiota that is able to remove the rutinosides from the juice glycosides, which results in aglycones that are then absorbed from the gut.","1182.0"
"Changes in phenolic content of tomato products during storage","21819081.0","The effect of storage on the total polyphenol content and individual phenolic compounds as well as on the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity of ketchups and tomato juices was studied. The total polyphenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, and the antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction was determined using DPPH and ABTS(+) assays. Individual polyphenols were identified and quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole. All analyses were carried out for ketchups and tomato juices after storage for 3, 6, and 9 months. The total polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the hydrophilic fraction decreased during storage of ketchups and tomato juices. Ketchups, in general, showed a slightly greater stability during storage than tomato juices. The most significant decrease was observed for quercetin followed by caffeic and ferulic acids, whereas glycosilated polyphenols showed greater stability during storage.","1183.0"
"Changes in phenolic profile and antioxidant activity during production of diced tomatoes","25213947.0","Tomatoes and tomato-based products are rich in antioxidants such as carotenoids, vitamin C and polyphenols. The industrial processing of diced tomatoes involves heat treatments in which these antioxidant compounds may be potentially affected. In this study, we evaluate the effect of each separate step in the dice-making process. Three technological processes were investigated: Hot, Cold and Cold treated with calcium salt (CaCl2). Four stages were monitored in each process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) peeled tomatoes; (3) diced tomatoes; and (4) final product after sauce addition. The main tool for minimising or counteracting the eventual processing damage was the strategy of 'reconstitution', achieved by adding a sauce rich in seeds and peels with high levels of antioxidants and phenolics to the diced tomatoes. Different analyses were carried out in order to evaluate the effect of each processing step. First, total polyphenols (TP) were evaluated using Folin-Ciocalteau (F-C) assay and antioxidant activity using ABTS(+) and DPPH assays. Flavonols, flavanones, hydroxycinnamic and phenolic acids were then quantified using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that each processing step induces alterations in the antioxidant and phenolic profile, and in particular sauce addition and calcium treatment significantly affected the levels of antioxidants and phenolics during the dice-making process.","1184.0"
"Effect of tomato industrial processing on phenolic profile and hydrophilic antioxidant capacity","","Industrial processing of tomatoes involves juice addition and heat treatment that may affect (increase or decrease) the levels of phenolic compounds. In this work, we evaluated the effect of each processing step in the paste-making process. Four technological processes were investigated on an industrial scale: Hot Break 28/30, Hot Break 22/24, Cold Break 28/30 and Passata 10/12; and four stages were monitored in each process: (1) fresh tomatoes; (2) juice after scalders and cream addition; (3) tomato paste from evaporators and (4) final paste. The effect of each processing stage was evaluated by different analyses: first, hydrophilic antioxidant capacity was evaluated using ABTS⁺ and DPPH assays and total phenolics using Folin–Ciocalteau method; then, individual polyphenols were quantified using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. This multifaceted approach has revealed that each processing stage induces different changes in the antioxidant and phenolic profile. The results of this study indicated that cream addition increases the hydrophilic antioxidant capacity and the amount of phenolic compounds positively, while heat treatment and, to a lesser extent, the sterilization stage during the paste-making process affect these compounds negatively.","1185.0"
"Phyto-oestrogen database of foods and average intake in Finland","12725654.0","Information on phyto-oestrogen intake in various populations has been scanty until now, primarily because data on the content of these compounds in foods were lacking. We report here on expansion of the Finnish National Food Composition Database (Fineli) with values for the plant lignans matairesinol and secoisolariciresinol and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein. The values, expressed as aglycones, were based on food analyses (mainly GC-MS) or imputed from analytical data for 180 foods for lignans and 160 foods for isoflavones; additionally, over 1000 values were derived from the recipe database of Fineli. Average intake of these phyto-oestrogens was calculated using food consumption data of the National Dietary Survey FINDIET 1997, which was carried out in a random sample of the adult population in five areas in Finland. The dietary data were collected by 24 h recall =2862). The mean lignan intake was 434 (standard deviation (SD) 1575) microg/d and the mean isoflavone intake was 788 (SD 673) microg/d. Women had a higher lignan density (microg lignans/MJ) in their diet than men (P<0.05). Men had a higher mean daily isoflavone intake, 902 (SD 368) microg, than women, 668 (SD 963) microg (P<0.05). The sources of lignans were many: seeds, cereals, fruit, berries and vegetables. The main sources of isoflavones appeared to be processed meat products/sausages containing soya as an ingredient, and legumes as such. The average intake of lignans and isoflavones in Finland seems to be low, but intake varies throughout the population.","1186.0"
"Activity and concentration of polyphenolic antioxidants in apple: effect of cultivar, harvest year, and storage conditions","11513636.0","Consumers' increasing interest in the relationship between diet and health is a sign for food producers to pay more attention to potential health-protecting compounds in new product development and food processing. From a production chain perspective the choice of the raw material that is used is important for the health-protecting potential of the end product. Four apple cultivars (Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Cox's Orange, and Elstar), which can be used as fresh apples or in processed apple products, were compared with regard to flavonol, catechins, phloridzin, and chlorogenic acid concentrations and antioxidant activity. Jonagold apples possessed the highest flavonoid concentration and the highest antioxidant activity. To study seasonal differences, apples from three different harvest years were analyzed, but in three cultivars no effect on flavonoid concentration and antioxidant activity was observed. Long-term storage, both at refrigerator temperature and under controlled atmosphere conditions, was found not to influence flavonoid concentration or antioxidant activity.","1187.0"

"Effect of gamma-irradiation on the phenolic acids of some Indian spices","","Five commercially important spices, namely cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg and mace, were subjected to gamma-irradiation using a dose of 10 kGy, which is recommended for microbial decontamination. Various phenolic acids present in these spices were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In clove and nutmeg, quantitatively significant changes were noted in some of the phenolic acids upon irradiation. The content of gallic and syringic acids in irradiated clove increased by 2.2- and 4.4-fold respectively, whereas in irradiated nutmeg many of the phenolic acids showed wide increases and decreases in the range of two- to sixfold compared with the control samples. No qualitative and major quantitative changes were, however, observed in the phenolic acids of cinnamon, cardamom and mace upon irradiation. The possibility that gamma-radiation induced breakdown of tannins could be responsible for the changes in phenolic acids content of clove and nutmeg is discussed.","1189.0"
"Primary and secondary metabolite composition of kernels from three cultivars of Portuguese chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) at different stages of industrial transformation","17407304.0","Chestnut (Castanea sativa) is an important basic food in rural diets and a major starch crop used in a similar way to potatoes. Chestnuts are a fundamental economic resource in the ""chestnut regions"" not only for the fruit but also for the chestnut wood. Chestnuts have become increasingly important with respect to human health, for example, as an alternative gluten-free flour source. Chestnuts are also a rich source of other beneficial compounds, but there have been few studies on the composition during processing. In this study, we analyzed the chemical composition of three Portuguese cultivars at different stages of industrial processing. The chestnut cultivars were Longal, Judia, and Martaínha. All three cultivars had high moisture contents but were low in ash, crude fat, and crude protein contents, with high starch and low fiber contents. The free amino acid contents, including various essential amino acids, varied depending on the cultivar. All three cultivars also had a significant content of polyphenolics with gallic acid; ellagic acid was predominant among hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Many of these compounds are known to exert significant positive effects on human health. The one-way analysis of variance for fresh chestnut shows significant differences among the three cultivars for most of the studied parameters. The same statistical analysis applied to each one of the two cultivars (Judia and Longal) sampled for the four processing steps analyzed indicates a significant effect of this factor in practically all of the constituents. On the other hand, the two-way analysis of variance shows that, besides the residual, the processing step and the interaction cultivar x processing step were the factors that more contributed for the total variation observed in the constituents analyzed, while the contribution of cultivar was much less significant.","1190.0"
"Antioxidant activity and total phenolics in selected fruits, vegetables, and grain products","","The antioxidant activities and total phenolics of 28 plant products, including sunflower seeds, flaxseeds, wheat germ, buckwheat, and several fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants were determined.

"Chemical composition of selected edible nut seeds","16787018.0","Commercially important edible nut seeds were analyzed for chemical composition and moisture sorption. Moisture (1.47-9.51%), protein (7.50-21.56%), lipid (42.88-66.71%), ash (1.16-3.28%), total soluble sugars (0.55-3.96%), tannins (0.01-0.88%), and phytate (0.15-0.35%) contents varied considerably. Regardless of the seed type, lipids were mainly composed of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (>75% of the total lipids). Fatty acid composition analysis indicated that oleic acid (C18:1) was the main constituent of monounsaturated lipids in all seed samples. With the exception of macadamia, linoleic acid (C18:2) was the major polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the case of walnuts, in addition to linoleic acid (59.79%) linolenic acid (C18:3) also significantly contributed toward the total polyunsaturated lipids. Amino acid composition analyses indicated lysine (Brazil nut, cashew nut, hazelnut, pine nut, and walnut), sulfur amino acids methionine and cysteine (almond), tryptophan (macadamia, pecan), and threonine (peanut) to be the first limiting amino acid as compared to human (2-5 year old) amino acid requirements. The amino acid composition of the seeds was characterized by the dominance of hydrophobic (range = 37.16-44.54%) and acidic (27.95-33.17%) amino acids followed by basic (16.16-21.17%) and hydrophilic (8.48-11.74%) amino acids. Trypsin inhibitory activity, hemagglutinating activity, and proteolytic activity were not detected in the nut seed samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms (Aw range = 0.08-0.97) indicated a narrow range for monolayer water content (11-29 mg/g of dry matter). No visible mold growth was evident on any of the samples stored at Aw < 0.53 and 25 degrees C for 6 months.","1192.0"
"Alkylresorcinols in wheat, rye and triticale","","Rye (<i>Secale cereale</i> L.), a cereal with valuable agronomic and nutritional benefits, contributes to sustainable agriculture, especially in areas where more demanding crops cannot be cultivated due to the poor agronomic value of soil. This review explores rye grain quality optimization strategies through production techniques. The quality and yield of grain are under the significant impact of agronomic factors, such as variety selection, crop rotation, soil tillage, fertilization, sowing practices, chemical protection, and harvest timing. It is also under the strong influence of the chosen farm's management strategy, like organic or conventional farming system. This review emphasizes its diverse potential utilization routes, and the importance of bioactive compounds, dietary fibers, phenolic acids, phytoestrogens, and benzoxazinoids that enhance its value as a functional food. Cereal grain with quality issues cannot be used as food for humans, however, it can still be utilized alternatively as a renewable biofuel. This review showed rye grain to have a potential to contribute to sustainable agriculture and at the same time build farms' resilience through possible alternative utilization strategies. It can serve as both a food source and a sustainable biofuel, offering a dual-purpose solution within the circular bioeconomy.","1193.0"
"Effect of Processing on Some Antinutritional Factors of Lentils","","Changes in the trypsin inhibitor activity and in the phytic acid, tannin, and catechin content of lentils (Lens culinaris var. Vulgaris) were investigated after soaking in distilled water, citric acid, and sodium bicarbonate solutions. The effect of cooking, after the seeds were presoaked in the above-mentioned solutions and both the soaking and cooking solutions were discarded, was also studied. Finally, two varieties of lentils (L. culinaris var. Vulgaris and Variabilis) were germinated for 6 days, and the effect on the trypsin inhibitor activity and the phytic acid, tannin, and catechin contents was also measured. Soaking did not modify the trypsin inhibitor activity, decreased the physic acid content, and increased the tannin and catechin contents. Cooking the presoaked seed brought about the total removal of trypsin inhibitor activity, a reduction of the physic acid level, and an increase of the content of tannins and catechins. The trypsin inhibitor activity and the physic acid content showed a large decrease after 6 days of germination, while amounts of tannins and catechins in the two lentil varieties studied increased. Cooking and germination seem to be good procedures to improve the quality of lentil flour from the nutritional point of view, despite the fact that a large variation on the effects of processing, related to the different legume varieties, has been observed.","1194.0"

Kernels which included the outer brown testa or pellicle, and shells which is the hard cover that surrounds the kernel, were evaluated for each cultivar. Strong correlations were found in kernels between AC and TP for both DPPH (r2 = 0.98) and ACORAC (r2 = 0.75) antioxidant assays. ACORAC values ranged from 372 to 817 μmol trolox equivalents/g defatted kernel, corresponding to Desirable and Kanza cultivars, respectively. CT ranged from 23 to 47 mg catechin equivalents/g defatted kernel and TP from 62 to 106 mg of chlorogenic acid equivalents/g defatted kernel. After a consecutive basic-acid hydrolysis, gallic acid, ellagic acid, catechin and epicatechin were identified by HPLC. The TP, AC and CT were 6, 4.5 and 18 times higher, respectively, for shells compared to kernels. The presence of phenolic compounds with high antioxidant capacity in kernels and shells indicates pecans can be considered an important dietary source of antioxidants.","1195.0"

"Phenol antioxidant quantity and quality in food : vegetables","","Fruits and vegetables in the diet have been found in epidemiology studies to be protective against several chronic diseases. Epidemiological evidence suggests that flavonoid consumption in the diet is protective against heart disease. Phenols in 23 vegetables have been measured by extraction with and without acid hydrolysis to determine the percent of conjugated and free phenols. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with catechin as the standard. The extracts' antioxidant quality was assayed by the inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation mediated by cupric ions. Vegetables had antioxidant quality comparable to that of pure flavonols and were superior to vitamin antioxidants. The phenol antioxidant index, measuring both the quantity and the quality of antioxidants present, was used to evaluate 23 vegetables. Isolated lower density lipoproteins from plasma spiked with two vegetable extracts were enriched with phenol antioxidants and showed decreased oxidizability. The average per capita consumption of vegetable phenols in the United States was estimated to be 218 mg/day of catechin equivalents. This is 3 times higher than the recommended intake of vitamin antioxidants.","1197.0"
"Phenol antioxidant quantity and quality in foods: cocoa, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate","10606537.0","This study developed a vegan chocolate spread using spray-dried plant-based milk powders (soy, lentil, and rice), fortified with nano-liposomal vitamin D3 and an oleogel-balanced omega fatty acid to enhance nutritional quality. The plant-based milk powders exhibited high protein (up to 26.8% in soy), fiber, and micronutrients. They were successfully incorporated into chocolate spreads, yielding products with a favorable texture and sensory acceptance comparable to commercial spreads. Nano-liposomal encapsulation of vitamin D3 achieved high encapsulation efficiency (94.2%), uniform nanoscale particle size (average 112 nm), and robust stability, ensuring effective vitamin delivery throughout storage. The oleogel, formulated from a blend of almond, coconut, avocado, red palm, and flaxseed oils, significantly improved the omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio (from 1:15 to 1:4.7) and provided enhanced oxidative stability, as confirmed by Rancimat testing. Sensory evaluation indicated that the fortified spreads maintained desirable flavor, mouthfeel, and overall acceptability. These results demonstrate that combining plant-based milk powders, nano-liposomal vitamin D3, and a balanced oleogel can produce a sustainable, nutritious, and appealing vegan chocolate spread. This approach offers a promising alternative for health-conscious consumers seeking functional, plant-based confectionery products.","1198.0"
"Phenol antioxidant quantity and quality in food : fruits","11714322.0","The free and bound phenols have been measured in 20 fruits commonly consumed in the American diet. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent with catechin as the standard after correction for ascorbic acid contribution. On a fresh weight basis, cranberry had the highest total phenols, and was distantly followed by red grape. Free and total phenol quality in the fruits was analyzed by using the inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation promoted by cupric ion. Ascorbate had only a minor contribution to the antioxidants in fruits with the exception of melon, nectarine, orange, white grape, and strawberry. The fruit extracts' antioxidant quality was better than the vitamin antioxidants and most pure phenols, suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. Using our assay, fruits had significantly better quantity and quality of phenol antioxidants than vegetables. Fruits, specifically apples and cranberries, have phenol antioxidants that can enrich lower density lipoproteins and protect them from oxidation. The average per capita consumption of fruit phenols in the U.S. is estimated to be 255 mg/day of catechin equivalents.","1199.0"
"Phenol antioxidant quantity and quality in foods: beers and the effect of two types of beer on an animal model of atherosclerosis","12926909.0","The free phenols have been measured in 15 lagers, 6 porters and ales, and 11 light and nonalcoholic beers. Phenols were measured colorimetrically using an oxidation-reduction reaction with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and catechin as the standard. The order of phenol concentration was ales > lagers > low calorie > nonalcoholic. The quality of antioxidants of the major phenols in beers and the quality of beer antioxidants were measured by (1) dose-response inhibition of lower density lipoprotein oxidation and (2) concentration of phenols in the beers at which 50% of the peroxide was destroyed in a luminescent assay for antioxidant activity. The beers' lipoprotein antioxidant quality was clearly superior to that of vitamin antioxidants and to that of the phenol ingredients, suggesting synergism among the antioxidants in the mixture. The average per capita consumption of beer in the United States in 2000 was 225 mL/day, equivalent to 42 mg/day of catechin equivalents. Beer provides more antioxidants per day than wine in the U.S. diet. A dark beer and a lager beer were given at two concentrations to cholesterol-fed hamsters, an animal model of atherosclerosis. At the high dose ((1)/(2)-diluted beer) both lager and dark beer significantly inhibited atherosclerosis compared to a control of 2% alcohol. At the high dose, lager significantly decreased cholesterol and triglycerides, and both beers acted as in vivo antioxidants by decreasing the oxidizability of lower density lipoproteins. At the low dose ((1)/(10)-diluted beer) only the lager beer significantly decreased atherosclerosis compared to the 0.4% alcohol control. The polyphenols in the beers appear to be responsible for the benefits of beer in this model. Lager beer inhibited atherosclerosis at a human equivalent dose in this hamster model of atherosclerosis.","1200.0"
"Olive oil phenolics are dose-dependently absorbed in humans","10692578.0","Olive oil phenolic constituents have been shown, in vitro, to be endowed with potent biological activities including, but not limited to, an antioxidant action. To date, there is no information on the absorption and disposition of such compounds in humans. We report that olive oil phenolics, namely tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol, are dose-dependently absorbed in humans after ingestion and that they are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates. Furthermore, an increase in the dose of phenolics administered increased the proportion of conjugation with glucuronide.","1201.0"
"Olive oils rich in natural catecholic phenols decrease isoprostane excretion in humans","11095986.0","This study was undertaken to evaluate, in humans, the antioxidant activity of olive oil phenolics, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone that share an orthodiphenolic (catecholic) structure. Human volunteers were administered olive oil samples containing increasing amounts of an olive oil phenolic extract that was characterized by gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry. The administration of phenol-rich oils was dose-dependently associated with a decreased urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), a biomarker of oxidative stress. Also, a statistically significant negative correlation between homovanillyl alcohol (HValc, hydroxytyrosol's major metabolite, formed through the COMT system) and F(2)-isoprostanes excretion was found. Thus, the administration of oil samples with increasing, albeit low, concentrations of orthodiphenolic compounds, namely hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein aglycone, results in a dose-dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha). The statistically significant negative correlation between 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) and HValc urinary concentrations suggests that this metabolite better reflects the in vivo activities of hydroxytyrosol.","1202.0"
"Hydroxytyrosol, as a component of olive mill waste water, is dose- dependently absorbed and increases the antioxidant capacity of rat plasma","11264904.0","Hydroxytyrosol is the most potent phenolic antioxidant of olive oil and olive mill waste water (OMWW) and its biological activities have stimulated research on its potential role in cardiovascular protection. However, evidence of the absorption of OMWW phenolics and on their possible in vivo activity has, until now, never been provided. Three groups male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg of the OMWW extract, respectively, providing 41.4, 207, and 414 microg/Kg of hydroxytyrosol, respectively. Urine was collected for 24 h and the urinary levels of hydroxytyrosol were quantified by mass spectrometry. Hydroxytyrosol was dose-dependently (R(2) = 0.95) absorbed and excreted in the urines mostly as a glucuronide conjugate. Further, the administration of an hydroxytyrosol-rich OMWW extract (10 mg/kg) to the rats was also associated with an increase of their plasma antioxidant capacity. Future experiments will eventually further clarify its metabolic fate and its in vivo actions.","1203.0"
"Hydroxytyrosol excretion differs between rats and humans and depends on the vehicle of administration","12888646.0","Interest in the in vivo biological activities of olive oil phenolics is rapidly growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT), the most representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in humans than in rats, a species with a high basal excretion of HT and its metabolites. The high (234% of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its administration as a natural component of olive oil (44.2% of HT administered) than after its addition to refined olive oil (23% of HT administered) or yogurt (5.8% of dose or approximately 13% of that recorded after virgin olive oil intake). These data suggest that the rat is not the appropriate model for the study of HT metabolism and that HT-containing functional foods should be carefully formulated.","1204.0"
"Bioavailability of trans-resveratrol from red wine in humans","15830336.0","Many in vitro studies demonstrated significant biological effects of trans-resveratrol. Thus, understanding the rate of intestinal absorption and metabolization in vivo of trans-resveratrol is the prerequisite to evaluate its potential health impact. Bioavailability studies mainly in animals or in humans using the pure compound at very high doses were performed. In this work, trans-resveratrol bioavailability from a moderate consumption of red wine in 25 healthy humans has been studied by three different experiments. The wine ingestion was associated to three different dietary approaches: fasting, a standard meal, a meal with high and low amount of lipids. Trans-resveratrol 3- and 4'-glucuronides were synthesized, purified, and characterized as pure standards. Bioavailability data were obtained by measuring the concentration of free, 3-glucuronide and 4'-glucuronide trans-resveratrol by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), both with ultraviolet (UV) and mass spectrometry (MS) detection, in serum samples taken at different times after red wine administration. Free trans-resveratrol was found, in trace amounts, only in some serum samples collected 30 min after red wine ingestion while after longer times resveratrol glucuronides predominated. Trans-resveratrol bioavailability was shown to be independent from the meal or its lipid content. The finding in human serum of trans-resveratrol glucuronides, rather than the free form of the compound, with a high interindividual variability, raises some doubts about the health effects of dietary resveratrol consumption and suggests that the benefits associated to red wine consumption could be probably due to the whole antioxidant pool present in red wine.","1205.0"
"Protocatechuic acid is the major human metabolite of cyanidin-glucosides","17709440.0","The metabolic fate of dietary anthocyanins (ACN) has not been fully clarified in humans. In all previous studies, the proportion of total ACN absorbed and excreted in urine was <1% intake. This study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of cyanidin-glucosides (CyG) contained in blood orange juice (BOJ). One liter of BOJ, containing 71 mg CyG, was consumed by 6 healthy, fasting volunteers. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected at baseline and at different times up to 24 h after juice consumption. The content of native CyG, glucuronidated/methylated derivatives, and various phenolic acids was determined by HPLC/MS/MS. The serum maximal concentration of cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc) was 1.9 +/- 0.6 nmol/L and that of protocatechuic acid (PCA) was 492 +/- 62 nmol/L at 0.5 h and 2 h after juice consumption, respectively. The calculated total amounts in plasma corresponded for Cy-3-glc to 0.02% and for PCA to 44% of CyG ingested. CyG and glucuronidated/methylated metabolites, but not PCA, were detected in urine. ACN recovered in 24-h urine collections represented approximately 1.2% of the ingested dose. Both CyG (1.90 +/- 0.04 nmol/g) and PCA (277 +/- 0.2 nmol/g) were recovered in 24-h fecal samples. Data explained the metabolic fate of 74% of BOJ ACN. PCA was for the first time, to our knowledge, identified in humans as a CyG metabolite, accounting for almost 73% of ingested CyG. A high concentration of PCA may explain the short-term increased plasma antioxidant activity observed after intake of cyanidin-rich food and it can also contribute to the numerous health benefits attributed to dietary ACN consumption.","1206.0"
"Direct liquid chromatographic analysis of resveratrol derivatives and flavanonols in wines with absorbance and fluorescence detection","","Moderate wine consumption is often associated with healthy lifestyle habits. The role of wine as a healthy drink is mainly due to its bioactive compounds, which differ according to various viticultural and enological factors. The aim of the present study was to observe the differences in bioactive compounds of white and red autochthonous Croatian wines, differing in terms of the grape variety and production technology. Our further aim was to explore the effect of their moderate consumption (200 mL per day) over the course of six weeks on some aspects of health in sixty-six healthy individuals. Participants were divided into eight groups depending on the wines consumed, while one group formed a non-consuming control group. Medical examination and laboratory tests were performed before the start and at the end of the consumption period. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL concentrations decreased. Additionally, an increase in HDL concentrations, and serotonin and dopamine levels, was observed. ALT, ALP, and GGT levels did not significantly increase in consumer groups, although alcohol concentration was relatively high in all the wines. Such results support the beneficial effects of wine-derived bioactive compounds on some health aspects resulting from moderate white and red wine consumption.","1207.0"

Stilbenes have been shown to protect lipoproteins from oxidative damage and to have cancer chemopreventive activity. We describe a method for the direct determination of stilbenes in several red wines using high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. In a survey of 12 commercial wines from the south of Brazil (Rio Grande del Sul), levels of delta-viniferin are reported for the first time in different varieties of red wines. Brazilian red wine contains trans-astringin, trans-piceid, trans-resveratrol, cis-resveratrol (in high quantity: 5 times more than the trans form), epsilon-viniferin, and a compound isolated for the first time in wine, trans-delta-viniferin. Isolation and identification of delta-viniferin was achieved by NMR after extraction and fractionation of red wine phenolics. delta-Viniferin contributes, as well as cis-resveratrol and trans-piceid, to a significant proportion of stilbenes in wine dietary intake, particularly with Merlot varieties containing an average level of 10 mg/L for delta-viniferin, 15 mg/L for cis-resveratrol, and 13 mg/L for trans-piceid. The total stilbene intake from wine origin was estimated for the Brazilian population as 5.3 mg/day per person (on the basis of a regular wine consumption of 160 mL/day). delta-Viniferin can contribute to around 20% of total stilbenes in wine (average of 6.4 mg/L in red Brazilian wines). It would be important in the future to investigate the origins of the differences in wine stilbene levels in relation to the vine varieties, and the bioavailability of the newly extracted stilbene delta-viniferin in plasma after consumption of different types of wines.","1208.0"

"Effect of thermal treatment on glucosinolates and antioxidant-related parameters in red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. ssp capitata f. rubra)","","The effects of various thermal processing treatments (blanching, boiling and steaming) of red cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. ssp. capitata f. rubra cv. 'Autoro', were assessed for the levels of glucosinolates (GLS), total phenols (TP), total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA), l-ascorbic acid (L-AA) and soluble sugars, as well as for the antioxidant potential by the ferric reducing ability power (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. Individual native GLS were determined by ion-pair HPLC-MS/DAD. There were significant (p <0.05) losses in blanched red cabbage: TP, 43%, TMA 59%, FRAP 42%, ORAC 51%, L-AA 48% and soluble sugars 45%. Boiling gave less extensive reductions: TP 16%, TMA 41%, FRAP 17%, ORAC 19%, L-AA 24% and soluble sugars 19%. Steaming caused no losses for TP, ORAC, FRAP or soluble sugars. However, significant reductions were found for TMA and L-AA, with 29% and 11%, respectively. In general losses were accounted for in the processing waters; however, TMA was not fully recovered, indicating degradation. Total GLS were severely affected by processing, with reductions of 64%, 38% and 19% in blanched, boiled and steamed red cabbage, respectively. Total aliphatic and indole GLS were similarly affected.

Blanching, prior to freezing, reduced total aliphatic and indole glucosinolates (GLS) by 31% and 37%, respectively. l-ascorbic acid (L-AA), total phenols (TP), anthocyanins, FRAP and ORAC were on average reduced by 19, 15, 38, 16 and 28%, respectively. The colour measured as CIELAB parameters was partly affected by blanching: lightness was significantly reduced in the white cultivars and in a romanesco type cultivar. Chromaticity was reduced in the coloured cultivars with a twice-as-large reduction in the purple cultivars. Hue increased for all samples, except for the purple cultivar where a decrease was found. Long-term freezer storage did not affect total aliphatic and indole GLS in cauliflower in a major way. Freezer storage did result in an average L-AA decrease of 24% for all but the purple cultivar. Some reductions in the TP levels were also found but not to the extent found for L-AA. When an effect was found in the FRAP and ORAC values, the reductions occurred towards the end of the storage period and were 15% and 37%, on average, respectively.

"Quantitative analysis of the main phenolics in rapeseed meal and oils processed differently using enzymatic hydrolysis and HPLC","","Rapeseed meal is the dry residue of the rapeseed de-oiling process. It contains more phenolic compounds than any other oilseed meal. In analysis, rapeseed phenolic esters, mainly sinapine, are usually hydrolyzed to free phenolic acids, because sinapine is not available as a commercial standard. In this study, the efficiencies of different enzymes and enzyme preparations in hydrolyzing sinapine to sinapic acid were explored. The main phenolics in rapeseed meal were sinapine and sinapic acid. In rapeseed oil, the main phenolics were vinylsyringol, sinapine and sinapic acid. In hydrolyzing rapeseed meal, ferulic acid esterase and Ultraflo L were as effective in hydrolyzing sinapine as sodium hydroxide. Over 90% of sinapic acid derivatives were hydrolyzed to yield sinapic acid. Compared to base hydrolysis, enzyme treatment was not only as efficient but also less destructive to the liberated phenolics. Thus, enzymatic hydrolysis is a recommended procedure for optimal analysis of rapeseed phenolics. In rapeseed oils, hydrolysis was best applied in crude post-expelled rapeseed oils with high phenolic content.","1214.0"

"The effect of cooking on Brassica vegetables","","Assessing antioxidant intake requires a food antioxidant database. However, cooking may affect antioxidant content due to antioxidant release, destruction or creation of redox-active metabolites. Here, effects of boiling, steaming and microwaving of broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and choy-sum (Chinese cabbage) were explored by measuring antioxidant contents of raw and cooked vegetables. Cooking water was also tested. For all cooked vegetables, antioxidant content was highest in steamed>boiled>microwaved, and decreased with longer cooking time, regardless of method. All steamed vegetables had higher antioxidant contents than had matching raw vegetables. Effects were variable for boiling and microwaving. Microwaving caused greater antioxidant loss into cooking water than did boiling. Marked losses of anitoxidants occurred in microwaved cabbage and spinach. To assess food antioxidant content/intake accurately, cooking effects need detailed study. Steaming may be the cooking method of choice to release/conserve antioxidants.

"Ferulic acid dehydrodimers in the cell walls of Beta vulgaris and their possible role in texture","","Sugarbeet, a form of Beta vulgaris var vulgaris, fails to soften completely after heating at 100 degrees C for several hours. This is due to thermal stability of the cell-wall polymers involved in cell-cell adhesion. In contrast, beetroot softens within 25-30 min due to a relatively rapid increase in the ability of the cells to separate. Information concerning the cell-wall polymers responsible for cell-cell adhesion was obtained by subjecting sugarbeet and beetroot tissues to a range of chemical and biochemical treatments designed to cleave cell-wall chemical bonds selectively. Treatment of sugarbeet tissues with chelating agents, weak base (Na2CO3, 0.05 M) or a purified, specific endoxylanase did not facilitate vortex-induced cell separation. However, this could be induced after extraction in dilute, cold alkali (0.05-0.1 M KOH) or dilute, hot acid (0.1 M TFA, 100 degrees C). Tissues from beetroot behaved similarly. Furthermore, the cell walls of sugarbeet and beetroot were similar in yield and neutral carbohydrate composition; the cell-wall-galacturonic acid content of beetroot was 50% higher as compared with sugarbeet. They were also rich in ferulic acid (FA) and its derivatives (6-7 mg g-1 CWM), and exhibited pH-dependent autofluorescence which disappeared during alkali-induced cell separation. In sugarbeet, over 20% of the FA was in dimer form. In beetroot, however, the value was only 10%. The main FA dimers were 8-O-4'DiFA and 8,5'DiFA (benzofuran form). The results indicate that the degree of thermal stability of cell-cell adhesion and, therefore, texture in Beta vulgaris tissues is related to the degree of FA-cross linking between pectic polysaccharides.","1218.0"
"High absorption but very low bioavailability of oral resveratrol in humans","15333514.0","The dietary polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to have chemopreventive activity against cardiovascular disease and a variety of cancers in model systems, but it is not clear whether the drug reaches the proposed sites of action in vivo after oral ingestion, especially in humans. In this study, we examined the absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism of 14C-resveratrol after oral and i.v. doses in six human volunteers. The absorption of a dietary relevant 25-mg oral dose was at least 70%, with peak plasma levels of resveratrol and metabolites of 491 +/- 90 ng/ml (about 2 microM) and a plasma half-life of 9.2 +/- 0.6 h. However, only trace amounts of unchanged resveratrol (<5 ng/ml) could be detected in plasma. Most of the oral dose was recovered in urine, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis identified three metabolic pathways, i.e., sulfate and glucuronic acid conjugation of the phenolic groups and, interestingly, hydrogenation of the aliphatic double bond, the latter likely produced by the intestinal microflora. Extremely rapid sulfate conjugation by the intestine/liver appears to be the rate-limiting step in resveratrol's bioavailability. Although the systemic bioavailability of resveratrol is very low, accumulation of resveratrol in epithelial cells along the aerodigestive tract and potentially active resveratrol metabolites may still produce cancer-preventive and other effects.","1219.0"

The time to reach maximal total ACN plasma concentration (C(max) BcACN/water = 0.37 +/- 0.07 micromol/L; C(max) BcACN/oatmeal = 0.20 +/- 0.05 micromol/L) occurred faster after BcACN/water (t(max)= 0.25 h), than after BcACN/oatmeal administration (t(max)= 1.0 h). In digesta and tissue samples, the 4 original blackcurrant ACNs were detected. The relative concentration of rutinosides in the digesta increased during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract, while the glucosides decreased. Maximum ACN excretion in urine occurred later after BcACN/oatmeal than after BcACN/water administration (3 compared with 2 h). The 4 original ACNs of blackcurrant in their unchanged form, as well as several metabolites, were identified in the urine samples of both groups. The simultaneous intake of food affects ACN absorption and excretion in the urine, but not metabolism.","1220.0"
"Isoflavone Content in Commercial Soybean Foods","","The concentration and distribution of isoflavones in 29 commercial soybean foods, categorized into soy ingredients, traditional and second-generation, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography and photodiode array detection. Twelve isomers were quantified, three aglycons (daidzein, genistein, glycitein) and nine glucosides (daidzin, genistin, glycitin; 6""-O-acetyldaidzin, -genistin, -glycitin; 6""-O-malonyldaidzin, -genistin, -glycitin). Compared with unprocessed soybeans, high-protein soy ingredients contained similar concentrations, except alcohol-leached soy concentrate. Traditional soybean foods showed differences between nonfermented and fermented foods. Nonfermented foods had greater levels of glucosides, while in contrast, greater levels of aglycons were found in fermented foods. Second-generation soy foods contained only 6-20% of the isoflavones of whole soybeans. The variety of soybean, method of processing, and addition of other components affect the retention and distribution of isoflavone isomers in soy foods.","1221.0"
"Quantification and characterization of anthocyanins in Balaton tart cherries","","The anthocyanin contents of Balaton and Montmorency cherries were compared. The results indicate that both cherries contain identical anthocyanins. However, Balaton contains approximately six times more anthocyanins than does Montmorency. Also, hydrolysis of the total anthocyanins and subsequent gas chromatographic (GC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments with the resulting products indicated that both varieties contain only one aglycon cyanidin. This observation contrasts with existing reports of the presence of peonidin glycosides in Montmorency cherry. Results of the present study suggest that the anthocyanins in Balaton and Montmorency cherries are anthocyanin 1 [3-cyanidin 2"" -O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-6""-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-beta -D-glucopyranoside], anthocyanin 2 [3-cyanidin 6""-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside], and anthocyanin 3 [3-cyanidin O-beta-D-glucopyranoside].","1222.0"

"Antioxidant activity in fruits and leaves of blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry varies with cultivar and developmental stage","10691606.0","Fruits and leaves from different cultivars of thornless blackberry (Rubus sp.), red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.), black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis L.), and strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa D.) plants were analyzed for total antioxidant capacity (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic content. In addition, fruits were analyzed for total anthocyanin content. Blackberries and strawberries had the highest ORAC values during the green stages, whereas red raspberries had the highest ORAC activity at the ripe stage. Total anthocyanin content increased with maturity for all three species of fruits. Compared with fruits, leaves were found to have higher ORAC values. In fruits, ORAC values ranged from 7.8 to 33.7 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh berries (35. 0-162.1 micromol of TE/g of dry matter), whereas in leaves, ORAC values ranged from 69.7 to 182.2 micromol of TE/g of fresh leaves (205.0-728.8 micromol of TE/g of dry matter). As the leaves become older, the ORAC values and total phenolic contents decreased. The results showed a linear correlation between total phenolic content and ORAC activity for fruits and leaves. For ripe berries, a linear relationship existed between ORAC values and anthocyanin content. Of the ripe fruits tested, on the basis of wet weight of fruit, cv. Jewel black raspberry and blackberries may be the richest source for antioxidants. On the basis of the dry weight of fruit, strawberries had the highest ORAC activity followed by black raspberries (cv. Jewel), blackberries, and red raspberries.","1224.0"
"Isocratic elution system for the determination of catechins, caffeine and gallic acid in green tea using HPLC","","China's ancient tea gardens boast a rich resource, and their unique environmental conditions cause their quality differences. In this study, flavor components and aroma compounds of fresh leaves from four Dancong ancient tea gardens (Zimao (ZMF), Baixiang (BX), Xialiao (HSK), and Da'an (DAF)) at different altitudes were determined by HPLC and GC-MS and then correlated with elemental contents. The results showed that low-altitude tea gardens ZMF had a higher caffeine content (5.21%) and astringency index (0.82) compared to other high-altitude tea gardens, which led to a more bitter taste and astringent sensation. Fresh leaves from ZMF had a higher content of linalool (151.31 μg/kg) and geraniol (61.09 μg/kg) than those of other tea gardens. Correlation analysis showed that the bitter and astringent indexes had a strong correlation with element N content (correlation coefficient: 0.74, 0.48); volatile compounds had significant positive or negative correlations with various elemental contents, among which the correlation coefficient between element Al content and linalool content of fresh leaves was -0.83 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The fresh leaves of ZMF tea gardens had a higher N content and lower Al, Si, and Hf content, which may cause more bitterness astringency and differences in volatile compounds in their teas than those of higher altitude tea gardens.

"Determination of flavonols in green and black tea leaves and green tea infusions by high-performance liquid chromatography","","Sichuan Congou black tea (SCGBT), one of China's top three high-aroma black teas, enjoys widespread consumer popularity. However, research into optimal processing varieties remains insufficient. This study assessed the quality of SCGBT produced from eight tea varieties: '<i>Fudingdabai</i>' (FDDB), '<i>Zhongcha 302</i>' (ZC302), '<i>Wuniuzao</i>' (WNZ), '<i>Chuancha</i> 2' (CC2), '<i>Fuxuan</i> 9' (FX9), '<i>Mingshan 131</i>' (MS131), '<i>Zhongcha 108</i>' (ZC108), and '<i>Huangjinya</i>' (HJY). Sensory evaluation, quantitative chemical analysis, and metabolomics techniques were employed. Results indicated that HJY, ZC302, and MS131 exhibited strong sweetness, umami, and mellowness, while CC2, FX9, and ZC108 were characterized by intense bitterness and astringency, attributed to high tea polyphenol levels and low free amino acid concentrations. The quality of WNZ and FDDB was relatively average. Using non-targeted metabolomics, 4,476 metabolite ion features were detected, and 75 significantly differential metabolites were identified (<i>p</i> < 0.05 and VIP > 1.0). Correlation analysis revealed that metabolites such as valine, L-glutamic acid, asparagine, L-serine, kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, quercetin-7-O-glucoside, L-tyrosine, and L-norleucine significantly influenced the taste of the tea infusion (|<i>r</i>| > 0.8, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Elevated levels of amino acids (L-glutamic acid and asparagine) and phenolic acids (gallic acid) contributed to the umami of HJY, ZC302, and MS131. Astringency was primarily determined by variations in flavonol/flavone and flavonol/flavone glycosides, as well as ester catechins. Additionally, the content of sweet-tasting amino acids and non-ester catechins was found to fluctuate. In summary, ZC302, MS131, and HJY are more suitable for processing into higher-grade SCGBT. These findings provide a theoretical and practical foundation for selecting and breeding high-quality SCGBT varieties and ensuring consistent product quality.","1226.0"

Pelargonidin-based anthocyanins such as pelargonidin 3-glucoside (291.3-945.1 microg/g fresh wt.), pelargonidin 3-rutinoside (24.7-50.9 microg/g fresh wt.), and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate (62.2-244.0 microg/g fresh wt.) were the predominant anthocyanins in strawberry fruit juice. The content of cyanidin-based anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-glucoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, was much lower than that of pelargonidin-based anthocyanins. Strawberry growth in high temperature conditions significantly enhanced the content of p-coumaroylglucose, dihydroflavonol, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 3-glucuronide, kaempferol 3-glucoside, kaempferol 3-glucuronide, cyanidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-glucoside, pelargonidin 3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-glucoside-succinate, and pelargonidin 3-glucoside-succinate in strawberry juice. Plants grown in the cool day and cool night temperature (18/12 degrees C) generally had the lowest phenolic acid, flavonols, and anthocyanins. An increase in night temperature from 12 to 22 degrees C, with the day temperature kept constant at 25 degrees C, resulted in a significant increase in phenolic acid, flavonols, and anthocyanins. These conditions also resulted in a significant increase in antioxidant capacity. The highest day/night temperature (30/22 degrees C) yielded fruit with the most phenolic content as well as ROO(*), O(2)(*)(-), H(2)O(2), OH(*), and (1)O(2) radical absorbance capacity. Fruit of Kent cv. strawberry had higher values of phenolic acid, flavonols, anthocyanins, and antioxidant capacities than fruit of Earliglow cv. strawberry under all temperature regimes.","1227.0"

"Determination of rosmarinic acid and caffeic acid in aromatic herbs by HPLC","","Basil is an aromatic herb of culinary importance as well as a rich source of phenolic compounds, secondary plant metabolites with strong antioxidant properties that are associated with dietary health benefits. Although basil is cultivated worldwide, little is known about how its phytochemical content changes as the plant matures, information that is useful to identify harvest strategies that maximize the herb's nutritional value. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of plant development on the phenolic composition and antioxidant properties of three green basil cultivars (Genovese, Spicy, and Tuscany) that were harvested weekly throughout the vegetative stage. Average total phenolic content (TPC), individual phenolic acid concentrations, and antioxidant capacity values showed significant cultivar × plant maturity interactions, indicating that these properties change with plant growth in genotype-specific ways. TPC values and the concentrations of rosmarinic, caffeic, and caftaric acids generally increased as basil plants matured. Caffeic acid had the highest concentrations (0.71-5.00 mg/100 g dry weight, depending on the cultivar) and levels correlated strongly with basil height (<i>r</i> <sub>s</sub> = 0.717; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and leaf mass (<i>r</i> <sub>s</sub> = 0.676; <i>p</i> < 0.001), suggesting that its accumulation is closely associated with plant growth. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the genotype exerts a greater influence than plant maturity on the phenolic composition of Genovese and Tuscany basils. In contrast, the chemical properties of Spicy basil varied greatly with developmental stage, implying that plant maturity plays a larger role in the phytochemical profile of this cultivar.","1229.0"

We conducted a pharmacokinetic study of soybean isoflavones in seven healthy male volunteers. After ingestion of 60 g of kinako (baked soybean powder, containing 103 micromol daidzein and 112 micromol genistein), changes of the isoflavone and metabolite concentrations in plasma, urine and feces were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The plasma concentration of genistein increased after 2 h and reached its highest value of 2.44 +/- 0.65 micromol/L 6 h later. The plasma concentration of daidzein peaked at 1.56 +/- 0.34 micromol/L at the same time, but it was always lower than that of genistein. Peak plasma concentration of O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol appeared after the daidzein peak in four and two subjects, respectively. In contrast with plasma, daidzein was the main component in urine. Urinary daidzein excretion started to increase shortly after the rise in its plasma concentration and reached 2.4 micromol/h 8 h after ingestion of kinako. Genistein excretion in urine paralleled that of daidzein, but the value at 6 h was about half (1.1 micromol/h). The majority of ingested isoflavones after ingestion of kinako were recovered on d 2 or 3 in the feces. Total recovery of daidzein, O-DMA and equol from urine and feces was 54.7%, calculated from daidzein intake; 20.1% of administered genistein was recovered as genistein. The half-lives of plasma genistein and daidzein were 8.36 and 5.79 h, respectively. The individual plasma and urinary concentrations of equol and O-DMA were quite variable; subjects were classified as high and low metabolizers. The high plasma concentration of isoflavones for at least several hours after a single ingestion of soy protein suggests that these compounds may interact with macromolecules and have biological effects.","1234.0"

"The contents of lignans in commercial sesame oils of Taiwan and their changes during heating","","Sesame lignans have multiple functions and were recently reported to have potential as sources of phytoestrogens. Sesame oils used in Taiwan are expelled from roasted sesame seeds with dark colour and strong flavour. This study analyzed lignan contents of 14 brands of sesame oils, and found their mean of total lignans to be 11.5 mg/g; 82% and 15% of the lignans were sesamin, and sesamolin, respectively. Sesamol contents were relatively higher in those with darker colour. In use as a cooking oil, heating at 180 °C for 4 min did not change the content of lignans, but the level of sesamol increased after heating at 180 °C for 20 min. Heating at 200 °C for 20 min caused a significant loss of sesamolin and sesamol. From our calculation, ingestion of 10 g of sesame oil is adequate to provide the level of lignans that might benefit cardiovascular health, as found by other studies. Cooking at temperatures above 200 °C will cause loss of some lignans, but sesamin, a source of phytoestrogen, is relatively heat-stable.","1238.0"
"Antioxidant properties of roasted coffee residues","15796608.0","The antioxidant activity of roasted coffee residues was evaluated. Extraction with four solvents (water, methanol, ethanol, and n-hexane) showed that water extracts of roasted coffee residues (WERCR) produced higher yields and gave better protection for lipid peroxidation. WERCR showed a remarkable protective effect on oxidative damage of protein. In addition, WERCR showed scavenging of free radicals as well as the reducing ability and to bind ferrous ions, indicating that WERCR acts as both primary and secondary antioxidants. The HPLC analyses showed that phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid) and nonphenolic compounds [caffeine, trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfuraldehyde] remained in roasted coffee residues. These compounds showed a protective effect on a liposome model system. The concentrations of flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds in roasted coffee residues were 8,400 and 20,400 ppm, respectively. In addition, the Maillard reaction products (MRPs) remaining in roasted coffee residues were believed to show antioxidant activity. These data indicate that roasted coffee residues have excellent potential for use as a natural antioxidant source because the antioxidant compounds remained in roasted coffee residues.","1239.0"
"High-amylose corn exhibits better antioxidant activity than typical and waxy genotypes","17227056.0","The consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains rich in antioxidative phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract, and aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the world; thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and phenolic acid compositions of typical and mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2, and high-amylose) were investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in methanol extracts and 60.41-67.26% in HCl/methanol (1/99, v/v) extracts of corn. The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g and from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv/kg of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80 and 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 10.57-12.47 and 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn in methanol and HCl/methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv/kg of corn. The composition of phenolic acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 mg/kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg/kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg/kg), syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg/kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg/kg), ferulic acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg/kg), and o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg/kg). Levels of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL, and ORAC in HCl/methanol extracts were obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high temperatures (65 and 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient temperatures (27 degrees C).

"Predictive analysis of cocoa procyanidins using near-infrared spectroscopy techniques","","Cocoa and its derivative products, especially chocolate, are highly appreciated by consumers for their exceptional organoleptic qualities, thus being often considered delicacies. They are also regarded as superfoods due to their nutritional and health properties. Cocoa is susceptible to adulteration to obtain illicit economic benefits, so strategies capable of authenticating its attributes are needed. Features such as cocoa variety, origin, fair trade, and organic production are increasingly important in our society, so they need to be guaranteed. Most of the methods dealing with food authentication rely on profiling and fingerprinting approaches. The compositional profiles of natural components -such as polyphenols, biogenic amines, amino acids, volatile organic compounds, and fatty acids- are the source of information to address these issues. As for fingerprinting, analytical techniques, such as chromatography, infrared, Raman, and mass spectrometry, generate rich fingerprints containing dozens of features to be used for discrimination purposes. In the two cases, the data generated are complex, so chemometric methods are usually applied to extract the underlying information. In this review, we present the state of the art of cocoa and chocolate authentication, highlighting the pros and cons of the different approaches. Besides, the relevance of the proposed methods in quality control and the novel trends for sample analysis are also discussed.","1242.0"
"Quercetin from shallots (Allium cepa L. var. aggregatum) is more bioavailable than its glucosides","18424596.0","The lipophilic character of quercetin suggests that it can cross enterocyte membranes via simple diffusion. Therefore, it should be more bioavailable than its glucosides, which require preliminary hydrolysis or active transport for absorption. However, the published human studies show that quercetin is less bioavailable than its glucosides. Assuming that low bioavailability of quercetin aglycone provided to humans as a pure substance is the result of its low solubility in the digestive tract, we studied its bioavailability from dietary sources in which quercetin was dispersed in the food matrix. In a randomized crossover study, 9 volunteers took a single dose of either shallot flesh (99.2% quercetin glucosides and 0.8% quercetin aglycone) or dry shallot skin (83.3% quercetin aglycone and 16.7% quercetin glucosides), providing 1.4 mg quercetin per kg of body weight. Blood samples were collected before and after consumption of shallot preparations. Plasma quercetin was measured on HPLC with electrochemical detection after plasma enzymatic treatment. The maximum plasma quercetin concentration of 1.02 +/- 0.13 micromol/L was reached at 2.33 +/- 0.50 h after shallot flesh consumption compared with 3.95 +/- 0.62 micromol/L at 2.78 +/- 0.15 h after dry skin consumption. The area under the concentration-time curve after dry skin consumption was 47.23 +/- 7.53 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1) and was significantly higher than that after shallot flesh intake (22.23 +/- 2.32 micromol x h(-1) x L(-1)). When provided along with dietary sources, quercetin aglycone is more bioavailable than its glucosides in humans. Results point to the food matrix as a key factor.","1243.0"
"Ellagic acid content in strawberries of different cultivars and ripening stages","","Ellagic acid is a phenolic compound which occurs naturally in strawberries. Interest in ellagic acid has increased during the past few years owing to its properties as a micronutrient. The objective of this study was to determine the ellagic acid content in strawberries compared with that in other common fruits and to evaluate its variability, the effects of ripening stage, and the tissue and seasonal variability in selected cultivars widely grown in Argentina. Strawberries showed significantly higher levels of ellagic acid than many other fruits of economic importance, ranging from 0.16 to 2.07 mg g(−1) dry weight. The ellagic acid content was highest in green fruit, intermediate in mid-ripe fruit and lowest in full-ripe fruit.

"Antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds in 32 selected herbs","","Total equivalent antioxidant capacities (TEAC) and phenolic contents of 32 spices extracts from 21 botanical families grown in Poland were investigated. The total antioxidant capacity was estimated by the following methods: ABTS+ (2,2'azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) expressed as TEAC. The total phenolics were measured using a Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of major phenolics by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were also used. Major phenolic acids identified in analyzed species were caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic and neochlorogenic, while predominant flavonoids were quercetin, luteolin, apigenin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin. Myricetin was detected only in Epilobium hirsutum. Many investigated spices had high levels of phenolics and exhibited high antioxidant capacity. The TEAC values of the spices ranged from 1.76 to 346 μM trolox/100 g dw, from 7.34 to 2021 μM trolox/100 g dw, and 13.8 to 2133 μM trolox/100 g dw for ABTS+, DPPH and FRAP, respectively. The total phenolic content, measured using a Folin-Ciocalteu assay, ranged from 0.07 to 15.2 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g dw. The herbs with the highest TEAC values were Syzygium aromaticum, E. hirsutum and the species belonging to the Labiatae and Compositae family. A positive relationship between TEAC (ABTS+ and FRAP) values and total phenolic content, measured by HPLC, was found only in family groups with many representative herbs within Labiatae and Compositae.","1248.0"
"Activities of amine and phenolic antioxidants and their changes in broad beans (Vicia faba) after freezing and steam cooking","","Antioxidant properties and changes in the levels of active compounds in fresh and processed broad beans were determined in the study. Activity of extracted substances was much higher against ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid]) than towards DPPH (2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals. Phenolics extracted with 70% acetone were also more active comparing to amine compounds obtained with water both in experiments applying radicals and during oxidation of linoleic acid. Steam cooking and freezing had a negative influence on the content of polyphenols and in consequence on their activity. Cooking fresh broad beans decreased the content of those compounds by 16% and freezing - by over 30%, while cooking frozen material resulted in a much lower further decrease (2-8%). Processes applied on fresh material reduced the activity against ABTS ⁺ to a smaller extent (cooking by 11% and freezing by around 20%), while cooking frozen beans caused a further decrease by 10-17%.","1249.0"
"Influence of industrial sterilisation, freezing and steam cooking on antioxidant properties of green peas and string beans","","We found that peptides or amino acids constituted the main fractions of water‐soluble nitrogenous compounds in green peas and string beans (44% and 79%, respectively). Their proportion increased after processing, especially in frozen peas and beans (61% and 95%, respectively). The content of phenolic compounds was decreased more after industrial processing (by 40% in peas and 50-70% in beans) than after cooking (by 20% in peas and 0-35% in beans). Antiradical activity against ABTS•⁺ (2,2′‐azino‐bis[3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulphonic acid]) was much higher in aqueous extracts of peas and beans (33 and 45 μmol Trolox g⁻¹ d.m., respectively) than in aqueous acetone extracts (approximately 17 μmol Trolox g⁻¹ d.m. in both). In most cases, the activity decreased after processing. Both aqueous and acetone extracts of peas showed equal activity against DPPH• (2,2′‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl), whereas in the case of beans this activity was four times lower in aqueous than in acetone extracts. Both reductions and increases of these activities were noted after processing.","1250.0"
"Studies on the dual antioxidant and antibacterial properties of parsley (Petroselinum crispum) and cilantro (Coriandrum sativum) extracts","","Antioxidant and antibacterial activities of freeze-dried and irradiated parsley (Petroselinum crispum) and cilantro (Coriandrum sativum) leaves and stems were determined on methanol and water extracts. The total phenolic content was quantified with the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent. Several mechanisms of potential antioxidant activity of all extracts, including determining relative free radical-scavenging and ferrous ion-chelating activities, as well as reducing power, were examined. Assessment of the total antioxidant activity of all extracts was done using an iron-induced linoleic acid oxidation model system. Antimicrobial activity towards Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli by different extracts was assessed by determining cell damage. Total phenolic content varied between parsley and cilantro, leaf and stem, as well as methanol and water extracts. Methanol-derived leaf extracts exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) greater radical-scavenging activity towards both lipid- and water-soluble radicals, which was attributed to the total phenolic content. Ferrous ion-chelating activity was significantly (p < 0.05) greater in the stem methanol extracts, and corresponded to antioxidant activity. Prooxidant activity was a feature of all aqueous extracts and corresponded to the reducing activity of both leaf and stem parts of parsley and cilantro. Bacterial cell damage, resulting in significant (p < 0.05) greater growth inhibition of B. subtilis and E. coli, corresponded to ferrous sequestering activity of methanol-derived stem extracts.","1251.0"
"Absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins in elderly women after consumption of elderberry or blueberry","","The absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACN) in humans was studied in four elderly women given 12 g elderberry extract (EBX) (720 mg total ACN), and six elderly women given 189 g lowbush blueberry (BB) (690 mg total ACN). The two major ACN in EBX, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside, as well as four metabolites: 1) peonidin 3-glucoside, 2) peonidin 3-sambubioside, 3) peonidin monoglucuronide, and 4) cyanidin-3-glucoside monoglucuronide were identified in urine within 4 h of consumption using HPLC-MS/MS with diode-array detector detection and retention time. Total EBX ACN excretion was 554 +/- 90 microg (mean +/- SD, n = 4) (0.077% of intake/4 h, wt/wt). In 5 of 6 women fed BB, urine samples contained ACN, which were identified as the original forms based upon comparisons to the BB food sample, which contained 24 ACN, 22 of which were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. Reasonable correlations between BB and urine proportions of the different ACN were obtained except for ACN arabinosides. Total urinary excretion during the first 6 h was 23.2 +/- 10.9 microg (mean +/- SD, n = 5) (0.004% of intake/6 h, wt/wt). Plasma ACN levels were below detection limits using 2 mL plasma in women that consumed BB. This study demonstrates for the first time that in vivo methylation of cyanidin to peonidin and glucuronide conjugate formation occurs after people consume ACN and demonstrates the low absorption and excretion of ACN compared with other flavonoids.","1252.0"
"Characterization of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins in some cultivars of Ribes, Aronia, and Sambucus and their antioxidant capacity","15612766.0","Anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins were characterized by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS coupled with a diode array and/or fluorescent detector in seven cultivars of Ribes nigrum (black currant) and Ribes rubrum (red currant, Red Lake), six cultivars of Ribes grossularia (gooseberries), Aronia melanocarpa(chokeberry), and Sambucus nigra (elderberry). Thirty-one different anthocyanins were detected in these berries, but not every anthocyanin was observed in each berry. A number of minor anthocyanins were identified from these berries for the first time. The concentrations of individual anthocyanins in all of the berries were quantified using relevant anthocyanidin 3-glucoside standards. Among the berries studied in this paper and in berries in general, chokeberry has the highest total anthocyanin concentrations [1480 mg/100 g of fresh weight (FW)], whereas the lowest total anthocyanin concentration in the berries studied was found in the gooseberry cv. Careless, which contained only 0.07 mg/100 g of FW. Two cultivars of gooseberries (Marigold and Leveller) did not contain any anthocyanins. Total proanthocyanidin concentrations in the berries studied ranged from 23 to 664 mg/100 g of FW in elderberry and chokeberry, respectively. Procyanidin or prodelphinidin polymers were the predominant components (>65% w/w) in most of the berries. The lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) procedure. The total antioxidant capacity varied from 21 micromol of TE/g of FW in Careless gooseberry to 161 micromol of TE/g of FW in chokeberry. Total phenolics in the berries in general paralleled hydrophilic antioxidant capacity.","1253.0"
"Pelargonidin is absorbed and metabolized differently than cyanidin after marionberry consumption in pigs","15465754.0","Weaning pigs (7.9 +/- 1.7 kg) were fed a freeze-dried powder of marionberry (MB) by stomach tube to study the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins. Four major anthocyanins (ACNs) were found in MB: cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3-glc, 78%), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (Cy-3-rutin, 20%), pelargonidin-3-glucoside (Pg-3-glc, 0.4%), and 1 unknown acylated cyanidin-based ACN (UACy, 1.5%). In the urine, the 4 original ACNs and 11 metabolites were identified and quantified. The main metabolites were glucuronidated and/or methylated forms of the original anthocyanins. Total recovery of the 4 original ACNs plus their related metabolites was 0.087 +/- 0.034% for Cy-3-glc, 0.084 +/- 0.026% for Cy-3-rutin, 0.583 +/- 0.229% for Pg-3-glc and 0.036 +/- 0.011% for UACy (mean +/- SD, n = 3), respectively. For the individual ACNs, the amount of metabolites recovered from Cy-3-rutin was lower than that of the original intact Cy-3-rutin, whereas the amounts of metabolites from Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc in the urine were much higher than their original forms. In pig plasma, the 2 original ACNs, Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin, and a trace of 1 metabolite (cyanidin monoglucuronide) were detected. The plasma concentration:dose ratio of Cy-3-rutin was higher than that of Cy-3-glc. Different aglycones and/or sugar moieties may influence the absorption and metabolism of ACNs. Cy-3-glc and Cy-3-rutin had similar apparent excretion rates relative to dose, whereas Pg-3-glc had a much higher total urinary excretion than cyanidin-based anthocyanins. Most of Cy-3-glc and Pg-3-glc were excreted in the form of metabolites, whereas most of the Cy-3-rutin was excreted in its original unmetabolized form. Urinary recovery of the acylated anthocyanin was lower than that of nonacylated anthocyanins.","1254.0"
"Lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities of common foods in the United States","15186133.0","Both lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities were determined using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC(FL)) assay with fluorescein as the fluorescent probe and 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride as a peroxyl radical generator on over 100 different kinds of foods, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, spices, cereals, infant, and other foods. Most of the foods were collected from four different regions and during two different seasons in U.S. markets. Total phenolics of each sample were also measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Hydrophilic ORAC(FL) values (H-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.87 to 2641 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g among all of the foods, whereas lipophilic ORAC(FL) values (L-ORAC(FL)) ranged from 0.07 to 1611 micromol of TE/g. Generally, L-ORAC(FL) values were <10% of the H-ORAC(FL) values except for a very few samples. Total antioxidant capacity was calculated by combining L-ORAC(FL) and H-ORAC(FL). Differences of ORAC(FL) values in fruits and vegetables from different seasons and regions were relatively large for some foods but could not be analyzed in detail because of the sampling scheme. Two different processing methods, cooking and peeling, were used on selected foods to evaluate the impact of processing on ORAC(FL). The data demonstrated that processing can have significant effects on ORAC(FL). Considering all of the foods analyzed, the relationship between TP and H-ORAC(FL) showed a very weak correlation. Total hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidant capacity intakes were calculated to be 5558 and 166 micromol of TE/day, respectively, on the basis of data from the USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994-1996).","1255.0"
"Aglycones and sugar moieties alter anthocyanin absorption and metabolism after berry consumption in weanling pigs","16177206.0","To investigate the absorption and metabolism of anthocyanins (ACNs) with different aglycones and sugar moieties, weanling pigs (11.4 +/- 3.8 kg) were fed, in a single meal, a freeze-dried powder of chokeberry, black currant, or elderberry at a single dose of 229, 140, or 228 mumol total ACN/kg body weight (BW), respectively. These berries provided ACNs with differences in aglycone as well as some unique differences in the sugar moieties. The relative proportions of the different metabolites depended upon concentrations, quantities consumed, and types of glycoside of ACNs in the berry. Delphinidin ACNs were not metabolized to any measurable extent. Cyanidin ACNs were metabolized via methylation and glucuronidation as well as by formation of both derivatives on the same ACN molecule. ACNs with either a di- or trisaccharide attached to them were excreted in the urine primarily as the intact form. Over 80% of the ACN compounds containing rutinose or sambubiose, which were excreted in the urine from black currant, elderberry, or Marion blackberry, were excreted as the intact molecule. The limited metabolism of these ACNs that did occur was via methylation. ACN monoglycosides other than the glucoside were metabolized via methylation and/or glucuronide formation. The monoglucuronide that formed represented a small proportion of the metabolites relative to the methylated or the mixed methylated and glucuronide forms of ACNs. The data clearly demonstrate that the aglycone and the sugar moieties can alter the apparent absorption and metabolism of ACNs.","1256.0"

"Effects of soy isoflavones on estrogen and phytoestrogen metabolism in premenopausal women","","The decline in estrogen levels among menopausal women can trigger multisystem dysfunction, significantly increasing the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and genitourinary syndrome (GSM). As plant-derived weak estrogen analogs, phytoestrogens demonstrate menopause-related protective potential in preclinical studies by selectively activating ERα, ERβ, and GPER receptor targets to modulate downstream signaling pathways. Current clinical trials indicate their value as an alternative strategy to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT, previously referred to as HRT) for managing menopause-related disorders. Although heterogeneity exists across study outcomes, specific formulations have shown clear efficacy. Future well-designed, large-scale studies are warranted to validate their clinical translational potential.","1259.0"
"Soy consumption alters endogenous estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women","10952094.0","Isoflavones are soy phytoestrogens that have been suggested to be anticarcinogenic. Our previous study in premenopausal women suggested that the mechanisms by which isoflavones exert cancer-preventive effects may involve modulation of estrogen metabolism away from production of potentially carcinogenic metabolites [16alpha-(OH) estrone, 4-(OH) estrone, and 4-(OH) estradiol] (X. Xu et al., Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev., 7: 1101-1108, 1998). To further evaluate this hypothesis, a randomized, cross-over soy isoflavone feeding study was performed in 18 healthy postmenopausal women. The study consisted of three diet periods, each separated by a washout of approximately 3 weeks. Each diet period lasted for 93 days, during which subjects consumed their habitual diets supplemented with soy protein isolate providing 0.1 (control), 1, or 2 mg isoflavones/kg body weight/day (7.1 +/- 1.1, 65 +/- 11, or 132 +/- 22 mg/day). A 72-h urine sample was collected 3 days before the study (baseline) and days 91-93 of each diet period. Urine samples were analyzed for 10 phytoestrogens and 15 endogenous estrogens and their metabolites by a capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Compared with the soy-free baseline and very low isoflavone control diet, consumption of 65 mg isoflavones increased the urinary 2/16alpha-(OH) estrone ratio, and consumption of 65 or 132 mg isoflavones decreased excretion of 4-(OH) estrone. When compared with baseline values, consumption of all three soy diets increased the ratio of 2/4-(OH) estrogens and decreased the ratio of genotoxic: total estrogens. These data suggest that both isoflavones and other soy constituents may exert cancer-preventive effects in postmenopausal women by altering estrogen metabolism away from genotoxic metabolites toward inactive metabolites.","1260.0"
"Epimerisation of tea polyphenols in tea drinks","","The present study was carried out to quantify green tea epicatechin (GTE) derivatives and to investigate the origin of epicatechin epimers present in 18 selected canned or bottled tea drinks. The major GTEs present in tea are (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) and (-)-epicatechin (EC). HPLC analysis showed that the content of total GTEs was lower (16.4-268.3 mg l-1) in the canned and bottled tea drinks than in tea traditionally prepared as a beverage in a cup or teapot (3-5 g l-1). The major finding was that they contained higher levels of epicatechin epimers, namely (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), (-)-gallocatechin (GC), catechin gallate (CG) and (-)-catechin (C), than of GTEs, ranging from 7.6 to 331.8 mg l-1. To investigate the origin of these epimers, GTEs were extracted from longjing green tea and autoclaved at various temperatures for 10-60 min. It was found that at least 50% of GTEs were epimerised to their corresponding epimers when autoclaved at 120°C for 20 min. It is concluded that epicatechin epimers in tea drinks are not originally present in green tea leaf but are instead derived from thermal conversion of GTEs.","1261.0"

Calycosin and formononetin were proved absorbable by four methods; (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan and 7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan were proved absorbable by three methods; formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside and (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucoside were proved absorbable by two methods. The existence of calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, formononetin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, (6aR,11aR)-3-hydroxy-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucuronide, 7,2'-dihydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and calycosin sulfate was proved by two or three methods. We found that besides isoflavones, pterocarpans and isoflavans also could be metabolized by the intestine during absorption, and the major metabolites were glucuronides. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the flavonoids in Astragali Radix decoction, including isoflavones, pterocarpans, and isoflavans, could be absorbed and metabolized by the intestine. These absorbable compounds, which were reported to have various bioactivities related to the curative effects of Astragali Radix decoction, could be regarded as an important component of the effective constituents of Astragali Radix decoction.","1262.0"
"Effect of soaking, boiling, and steaming on total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of cool season food legumes","26050159.0","The effects of soaking, boiling and steaming processes on the total phenolic components and antioxidant activity in commonly consumed cool season food legumes (CSFL's), including green pea, yellow pea, chickpea and lentil were investigated. As compared to original unprocessed legumes, all processing steps caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in total phenolic content (TPC), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (DPPH) in all tested CSFL's. All soaking and atmospheric boiling treatments caused significant (p<0.05) decreases in oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC). However, pressure boiling and pressure steaming caused significant (p<0.05) increases in ORAC values. Steaming treatments resulted in a greater retention of TPC, DPPH, and ORAC values in all tested CSFL's as compared to boiling treatments. To obtain cooked legumes with similar palatability and firmness, pressure boiling shortened processing time as compared to atmospheric boiling, resulted in insignificant differences in TPC, DPPH for green and yellow pea. However, TPC and DPPH in cooked lentils differed significantly between atmospheric and pressure boiling. As compared to atmospheric processes, pressure processes significantly increased ORAC values in both boiled and steamed CSFL's. Greater TPC, DPPH and ORAC values were detected in boiling water than that in soaking and steaming water. Boiling also caused more solid loss than steaming. Steam processing exhibited several advantages in retaining the integrity of the legume appearance and texture of the cooked product, shortening process time, and greater retention of antioxidant components and activities.","1263.0"

"Phenolic Content, Composition, Antioxidant Activity, and Their Changes during Domestic Cooking of Potatoes","19831402.0","Potatoes in the diet contribute significantly to antioxidant daily intake worldwide. The influence of different domestic cooking conditions, boiling, microwaving, and baking, on total phenolics (TP), antioxidant capacity, phenolic composition, and tryptophan content was studied using eight commercial potato varieties. The antioxidant capacity was detected by the methods of oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH(*)) assay. The phenolic composition and tryptophan content were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), whereas phenolics and tryptophan were identified by means of HPLC-mass spectrometry, HPLC-DAD, and authentic standards. Antioxidant capacity was influenced by potato variety and cooking conditions; however, cooked potatoes retained 68-97% ORAC value depending on cooking procedure and variety. Chlorogenic acid and its isomers dominated the phenolic composition of each variety involved in this study. ORAC and TP were highly and positively correlated (r = 0.9119). Norkotah ranked highest in chlorogenic acid content and antioxidant value. Principal component analysis showed different cooking processes did not influence the trend of the antioxidant profile of the eight potato varieties, but specific compounds exert influence on the antioxidant capacity. The results imply that the potato varieties rich in antioxidant components could be good antioxidant sources as activities are not greatly affected by different cooking conditions.","1265.0"
"Influence of polyphenol and ascorbate oxidases during cooking process on the radical-scavenging activity of vegetables","","Oxidative stress, resulting from dysregulation in the secretion of adrenal hormones, represents a major concern in human health. The present review comprehensively examines various categories of endocrine dysregulation within the adrenal glands, encompassing glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens. Additionally, a comprehensive account of adrenal hormone disorders, including adrenal insufficiency, Cushing's syndrome, and adrenal tumors, is presented, with particular emphasis on their intricate association with oxidative stress. The review also delves into an examination of various nutritional antioxidants, namely vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, selenium, zinc, polyphenols, coenzyme Q10, and probiotics, and elucidates their role in mitigating the adverse effects of oxidative stress arising from imbalances in adrenal hormone levels. In conclusion, harnessing the power of nutritional antioxidants has the potential to help with oxidative stress caused by an imbalance in adrenal hormones. This could lead to new research and therapeutic interventions.","1266.0"
"Varietal differences in phenolic content and antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of onions","15506817.0","Epidemiological studies have indicated that the consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk for the development of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Phytochemicals, including phenolics and flavonoids, are suggested to be the major bioactive compounds contributing to the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. Onions are a major source of dietary flavonoids; however, there may exist varietal differences in composition, concentration, and beneficial activities. To characterize these differences, shallots and 10 onion (Allium cepa L.) varieties commonly available in the United States (Western Yellow, Northern Red, New York Bold, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia) were evaluated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant and antiproliferative activities. Shallots contained the highest total phenolic content (114.7 +/- 10.0 mg/100 g of sample) among the varieties tested, with a 6-fold difference observed when compared to the variety with the lowest phenolic content (Vidalia, p < 0.05). Western Yellow onion variety exhibited the highest total flavonoid content (69.2 +/- 3.7 mg/100 g of onion) of the varieties tested, with an 11-fold difference when compared to the variety with the lowest flavonoid content (Western White, p < 0.05). Shallots exhibited the highest total antioxidant activity (45.5 +/- 2.1 micromol of vitamin C equiv/g of onion), followed by Western Yellow, New York Bold, Northern Red, Mexico, Empire Sweet, Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia. For all varieties, both total phenolic and flavonoid contents were strongly correlated with total antioxidant activity (R (2) = 0.9668, p < 0.05; and R (2) = 0.7033, p < 0.05, respectively). The proliferation of HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion after exposure to the Western Yellow, shallots, New York Bold, and Northern Red extracts, with Western Yellow, shallots, and New York Bold exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against HepG(2) cells and New York Bold and Western Yellow exhibiting the highest antiproliferative activity against Caco-2 cells. However, the varieties of Western White, Peruvian Sweet, Empire Sweet, Mexico, Texas 1015, Imperial Valley Sweet, and Vidalia demonstrated weak antiproliferative activity against both HepG(2) and Caco-2 cells. These results may influence consumers toward purchasing onion varieties exhibiting greater potential health benefits and may significantly affect future breeding efforts to enhance onion nutritional qualities.","1267.0"
"Metabolic profile of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid in rats, an in vivo and in vitro study","","To explore the metabolism of 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (1,5-DCQA) in rats, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in parallel to diode-array detection was used for the rapid detection/characterization of the metabolites formed in bile, urine, and plasma of rats following oral administration of 1,5-DCQA (160 mg/kg). The methylation and glucuronidation of 1,5-DCQA occurring in vitro using rat liver and small intestinal microsomes and cytosols were studied in comparison with those occurring in vivo, and the enzymes involved were also determined. In addition, the anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) activity of three important metabolites was preliminarily evaluated in MT-4 cells infected with HIV-1. A total of 22 metabolites in vivo and in vitro were identified, including four isomeric O-mono-methylated metabolites (M8-M11), nine isomeric O-di-methylated metabolites (M3, M6, M22, and M12-M17), four isomeric O-mono-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M2 and M19-M21), four isomeric O-di-methyl-glucuronidated metabolites (M1, M4, M5, and M7), and one glucuronidated metabolite (M18). The O-methylation positions of three important metabolites (M8, M9, and M12) were determined (3''-, 3'-, and 3',3''-) by comparing with synthesized standards. The efficacy experiments showed that M8, M9, and M12 could inhibit HIV replication with IC(50) values of about 25, 25, and 46 microM, respectively. These results suggest that O-methylation and glucuronidation are two important metabolic pathways of 1,5-DCQA, that both rat liver and small intestine can catalyze such reactions by catechol-O-methyltransferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and that the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of M8, M9, and M12 is comparable to or slightly weaker than that of 1,5-DCQA.","1268.0"
"Relative antioxidant and cytoprotective activities of common herbs","","Many studies have been carried out on bioactivities of individual herbs, however, no collective study on their comparative antioxidant and cytoprotective activities against oxidative damage has been reported. We selected 17 common commercial herbs and studied their relative phenolic contents, antioxidant activities, and cytoprotective activities on gap-junction intercellular communication and antioxidative enzymes in vitro under the same conditions. Total polyphenol content ranged from 464 to 870 gallic acid equivalents (GAE) mg/100 g and total flavonoid content from 212 to 494 catechin equivalents (CE) mg/100 g. Among the samples, chamomile, rosehip, hawthorn, lemon verbena, and green tea contained relatively high total phenolics (769-844 mg GAE/100 g) and flavonoids (400-4 mg CE/100 g). Chamomile also showed the highest antioxidant activity with 960 mg/100 g of vitamin C equivalent (VCE), followed by hawthorn (929 mg VCE/100 g) and black tea (916 mg VCE/100 g). Total phenolic and total flavonoids showed a higher correlation with antioxidant activity. Most of herbs enhanced cell viability and showed protective effects against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79-4) cells. Furthermore, herbs used in this study showed higher protective effect on gap-junction intercellular communication (GJIC) as compared to gallic acid and catechin, and also enhanced activity of the antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in a dose-dependent manner.","1269.0"
"Variations in the Composition of Various Acyl Lipids, Tocopherols and Lignans in Sesame Seed Oils Roasted in a Microwave-Oven","","Seeds from various strains of cultivated Sesamum indicum Linn (colour of seeds: black, brown and white) were exposed to microwave roasting for 16 and 30 min at a frequency of 2450 MHz and were studied not only for different acyl lipids and their fatty acid compositions, but also for the contribution of antioxidants to the oxidative stability of the oils. Lipids from all-seeded strains were comparable in their total fatty acid composition, with linoleic, oleic, stearic and palmitic acids as the major acids. The total lipids were isolated by thin-layer chromatography into the following five fractions: triacylglycerols (TAG), diacylglycerols, free fatty acids, polar lipids and steryl esters. The TAG were slightly and randomly hydrolysed by microwaves, but was still representing 900 g kg-1 of the total lipids at 30 min off roasting. Although burning and bitter tastes occurred at the time, the tocopherols and lignans still amounted to over 80% of the original level. The results suggested that the oxidative stability of the oils would probably be due to the synergism between endogenous antioxidants and browning substances produced during microwave roasting.","1270.0"
"Effects of seed roasting temperature and time on the quality characteristics of sesame (Sesamum indicum) oil","","The quality characteristics and composition of sesame oils prepared at different roasting temperatures (160-250 degrees C) from sesame seeds using a domestic electric oven were evaluated as compared to an unroasted oil sample: only minor increases (P < 0.05) in characteristics, such as peroxide value, carbonyl value, anisidine value and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, of sesame oils occurred in relation to increasing roasting temperature and time between 160 and 200 degrees C, but colour units of oils increased markedly over a 220 degrees C roasting temperature. Significant decreases (P < 0.05) were observed in the amounts of triacylglycerols and phospholipids in the oils prepared using a 250 degrees C roasting temperature. The amounts of gamma-tocopherol and sesamin still remained over 80 and 90%, respectively, of the original levels after roasting at 250 degrees C. In the oil prepared using a 250 degrees C roasting temperature, sesamol was detected at 3370 mg per kg oil, but sesamolin was almost depleted after 25 min of roasting. Burning and bitter tastes were found in the oils prepared at roasting temperatures over 220 degrees C. The results suggested that a high-quality product would be obtained by roasting for 25 min at 160 or 180 degrees C, 15 min at 200 degrees C and 5 min at 220 degrees C when compared with the other samples.","1271.0"
"Identification and quantification of metabolites of orally administered naringenin chalcone in rats","19558184.0","Naringenin chalcone is the main active component of tomato skin extract, which has an antiallergic activity. In this study, naringenin chalcone was orally administered to rats, and the chemical structures and levels of the major metabolites in the plasma and urine of rats were determined. HPLC analysis indicated the presence of three major metabolites in the urine. LC-MS and NMR analyses tentatively identified these as naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide, naringenin-7-O-beta-D-glucuronide, and naringenin-4'-O-beta-D-glucuronide. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide was the only metabolite detected in the plasma, and its peak plasma level was observed 1 h after naringenin chalcone administration. Naringenin chalcone-2'-O-beta-D-glucuronide also inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This activity might contribute to the antiallergic activity of naringenin chalcone in vivo. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to report determination of naringenin chalcone metabolites in rat plasma and urine.","1272.0"
"Phytochemical phenolics in organically grown vegetables","16302198.0","Fruit and vegetable intake is inversely correlated with risks for several chronic diseases in humans. Phytochemicals, and in particular, phenolic compounds, present in plant foods may be partly responsible for these health benefits through a variety of mechanisms. Since environmental factors play a role in a plant's production of secondary metabolites, it was hypothesized that an organic agricultural production system would increase phenolic levels. Cultivars of leaf lettuce, collards, and pac choi were grown either on organically certified plots or on adjacent conventional plots. Nine prominent phenolic agents were quantified by HPLC, including phenolic acids (e. g. caffeic acid and gallic acid) and aglycone or glycoside flavonoids (e. g. apigenin, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin). Statistically, we did not find significant higher levels of phenolic agents in lettuce and collard samples grown organically. The total phenolic content of organic pac choi samples as measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, however, was significantly higher than conventional samples (p < 0.01), and seemed to be associated with a greater attack the plants in organic plots by flea beetles. These results indicated that although organic production method alone did not enhance biosynthesis of phytochemicals in lettuce and collards, the organic system provided an increased opportunity for insect attack, resulting in a higher level of total phenolic agents in pac choi.","1273.0"
"Changes in quality and phenolic compounds of virgin olive oils during objectively described fruit maturation","","The effect of fruit ripening on the quality of the oil extracted and on the changes in the amount of phenolic compounds was determined in two olive varieties (Olea europaea, cvs. Arbequina and Picual) in two crop seasons, characterized by showing the same mean temperature and different rainfalls. Maturation level was evaluated using six methods: Harvest date, ripening index (RI), fruit skin colour, fruit firmness, and amount of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the oil. Oil quality, evaluated using the parameters established to determine the quality level of virgin olive oils (acidity, K232, K270, peroxide index, and panel test), was not affected by fruit ripening or by the increase in rainfall of the season. However, the changes in oil stability and phenolic compounds in the oils extracted during fruit ripening strongly differed according to the variety, the maturity level of the fruit and the crop season tested. Fruit skin colour and firmness allowed a better discrimination at the initial maturity stages than the other methods tested.","1274.0"

"Human, rat, and mouse metabolism of resveratrol","","<h4>Purpose</h4>Resveratrol, a phenolic phytoalexin occurring in grapes, wine, peanuts, and cranberries, has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, phytoestrogenic, and cardioprotective activities. Because little is known about the metabolism of this potentially important compound, the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of trans-resveratrol were investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>The in vitro experiments included incubation with human liver microsomes, human hepatocytes, and rat hepatocytes and the in vivo studies included oral or intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol to rats and mice. Methanol extracts of rat urine, mouse serum, human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, and human liver microsomes were analyzed for resveratrol metabolites using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line ultraviolet-photodiode array detection and mass spectrometric detection (LC-DAD-MS and LC-UV-MS-MS). UV-photodiode array analysis facilitated the identification of cis- and trans-isomers of resveratrol and its metabolites. Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometric analysis provided molecular weight confirmation of resveratrol metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry allowed structural information to be obtained.<h4>Results</h4>No resveratrol metabolites were detected in the microsomal incubations, and no phase I metabolites, such as oxidations, reductions, or hydrolyzes, were observed in any samples. However, abundant trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate were identified in rat urine, mouse serum, and incubations with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation with beta-glucuronidase and sulfatase to release free resveratrol was used to confirm the structures of these conjugates. Only trace amounts of cis-resveratrol were detected, indicating that isomerization was not an important factor in the metabolism and elimination of resveratrol.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results indicate that trans-resveratrol-3-O-glucuronide and trans-resveratrol-3-sulfate are the most abundant metabolites of resveratrol. Virtually no unconjugated resveratrol was detected in urine or serum samples, which might have implications regarding the significance of in vitro studies that used only unconjugated resveratrol.","1278.0"

"Phenolic acids of borage (Borago officinalis L.) and evening primrose (Oenothera biennis L.)","","The study evaluated the effects of basil or sage supplementation (50-100 g added to 250 mL of cold-pressed oil) and long-term refrigerated storage on fatty acid composition, selected nutritional indices and total low molecular weight antioxidant activity (TAA) in cold-pressed oils. The study included black cumin, borage, evening primrose, safflower, walnut, hazelnut, rapeseed seed oils, and sea buckthorn-rapeseed oil. Fatty acid analysis revealed that the process of herb maceration resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of linoleic acid and a reduction in the proportion of saturated fatty acids in black cumin seed oil. Moreover, the analysis demonstrated an increase in the proportion of linoleic acid and a reduction in the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids in sea-buckthorn-rapeseed oil. Furthermore, the addition of herbal additives to black cumin seed oil was found to enhance the nutritional indices of macerates. A significant decrease in TAA levels was observed following storage, however the herb addition improved TAA during storage. The TAA reduction was consistently smaller in herb-macerated oils compared with controls, except in black cumin seed oil macerates. The addition of sage was found to be particularly beneficial, particularly at the 100 g dose.","1280.0"

"Effect of processing and storage on the antioxidant ellagic acid derivatives and flavonoids of red raspberry (Rubus idaeus) jams","11513642.0","From red raspberries, ellagic acid, its 4-arabinoside, its 4' (4' '-acetyl) arabinoside, and its 4' (4' '-acetyl)xyloside, as well as quercetin and kaempferol 3-glucosides, were identified. In addition, two unidentified ellagic acid derivatives were detected. The free radical scavenging activity of the ellagic acid derivatives was evaluated by using the DPPH method and compared to that of Trolox. All of the isolated compounds showed antioxidant activity. The effect of processing to obtain jams on raspberry phenolics was evaluated. The flavonol content decreased slightly with processing and more markedly during storage of the jams. The ellagic acid derivatives, with the exception of ellagic acid itself, remained quite stable with processing and during 6 months of jam storage. The content of free ellagic acid increased 3-fold during the storage period. The initial content (10 mg/kg of fresh weight of raspberries) increased 2-fold with processing, and it continued increasing up to 35 mg/kg after 1 month of storage of the jam. Then a slight decrease was observed until 6 months of storage had elapsed. The increase observed in ellagic acid could be explained by a release of ellagic acid from ellagitannins with the thermal treatment.","1282.0"
"Changes during storage in conventional and ecological wine: Phenolic content and antioxidant activity","14705898.0","Polyphenol content, free radical scavenging capacity, and changes during storage over 7 months in the dark were studied in ecological and conventional red and white wines. In red wines, the most changeable components during storage were the anthocyanins since during storage anthocyanins content decreased 88% in conventional wine and 91% in ecological wine. Initially, the total flavonol contents of the conventional and ecological red wines were 163.88 +/- 2.69 and 153.58 +/- 1.71 mg/L, respectively, and no significant variations occurred during storage. No differences in hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives content between conventional and ecological red and white wines were observed. The flavonol level in white wines was very low, as expected since these compounds are found in grape skin. The initial antioxidant activity was 5.37 +/- 0.14 and 5.82 +/- 0.31 mM equivalents Trolox for conventional and ecological red wines, respectively; no significant differences were observed (p = 0.2831), and these values were 7-8 times higher than the antioxidant activity observed in conventional and ecological white wine.

"Resveratrol metabolites in urine as a biomarker of wine intake in free-living subjects: The PREDIMED Study","19167481.0","Several clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that moderate wine consumption may exert a protective effect against oxidative stress involved in several diseases, such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the epidemiological assessment of wine consumption has usually been obtained using self-reported questionnaires containing less reliable information for assessing total intake than nutritional biomarkers. A reliable biomarker for wine consumption is, therefore, needed. To validate urinary resveratrol metabolites (RMs) as a biomarker of wine consumption in a large cohort of free-living subjects, 1000 consecutive subjects entering a substudy of the PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea) were evaluated. Data were collected in a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. RMs were measured in morning urine by LC-MS/MS. Urinary RM values correlated directly with reported daily amounts of wine consumed (r=0.895; p<0.001). One drink of wine per week can be detected. Using a cut-off of 411.4 nmol/g creatinine, the measurement of urinary RMs could discriminate wine consumers from non-wine consumers with a sensitivity of 93.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 91.5-94.7%) and a specificity of 92.1% (CI 90.2-93.7%). Urinary RMs fulfill the criteria to be considered as a nutritional biomarker of wine consumption in a large sample of free-living subjects. This biomarker would provide an additional tool for investigating more precisely the relationship between wine consumption and health benefits.","1285.0"
"In vitro antioxidant activities of barley, husked oat, naked oat, triticale, and buckwheat wastes and their influence on the growth and biomarkers of antioxidant status in rats","16756343.0","The study was aimed at verification of the following hypothesis: differences in antioxidant capacity of diets consisting of different cereals and byproducts affect the antioxidant status of the consumers of these diets. To validate that hypothesis this study investigated the contents of polyphenols and alpha-tocopherol as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in vitro of cereals and their fractions (barley, husked and naked oat, oat bran, and triticale); the nutritional and antioxidant properties of diets containing these cereals, applied in a 4-week feeding experiment on rats, were also assessed. Among the cereals examined, the highest TAC was reported for barley (13.16 micromol of Trolox/g) and the lowest for naked oat (3.84 micromol of Trolox/g). Compared with cereals, the TAC of buckwheat waste was 2-3 times higher (25.2 micromol of Trolox/g). The antioxidant capacity of diets, calculated in vitro, ranged from 6.35 micromol of Trolox/g for naked oat type diet to 10.51 micromol of Trolox/g for barley type diet. Results of an in vitro study were confirmed in changes of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and the level of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in the serum of rats fed diets with the highest and lowest antioxidant capacities in vitro; the barley diet increased the activity of GPx (37.63 units/mL) and decreased the level of TBARS (4.82 microg/g), whereas the naked oat diet had an opposite effect (31.16 units/mL and 5.91 microg/g, respectively).","1286.0"
"Inhibitory effect of jasmine green tea epicatechin isomers on LDL-oxidation","","Oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is thought to play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. The present study examined inhibitory effect of jasmine green tea polyphenol (GTP) extracts and its individual epicatechin isomers on Cu+2-mediated oxidation of human LDL. The jasmine tea GTP extracts consisted mainly of four epicatechin isomers with (-) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) being most abundant (51.2%) followed by (-) epigallocatechin (EGC, 18.7%), (-)epicatechin (EC, 12.3%), and (-)epicatechin gallate (ECG, 11.8%). Jasmine tea GTP as a mixture or its four epicatechin isomers demonstrated strong antioxidant activity in Cu+2-mediated oxidation of human LDL. The inhibitory effect of these epicatechin isomers on LDL oxidation was dose-dependent at the concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 micromolar. EC and EGC were less protective against LDL oxidation than their gallate derivatives, ECG and EGCG, respectively. ECG and EGCG seemed to have a similar antioxidant activity. In contrast, EGC was less effective than EC as an antioxidant against LDL oxidation. The inhibitory effect of jasmine green tea epicatechin isomers on Cu+2-mediated oxidation was also characterized by protecting docosahexaenoic, arachidonic, alpha-linolenic, and linoleic acid in LDL against oxidative degradation. We conclude that, in addition to their hypocholesterolemic effect, jasmine tea epicatechin isomers may serve as a source of natural antioxidative agents in human diet.","1287.0"

"Analysis of Isopropyl 3-(3,4- Dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropanoate,a Metabolite of Danshensu, from Salvia miltiorrhiza, in Rabbit  plasma","","Plants have been used for therapeutic purposes against various human ailments for several centuries. Plant-derived natural compounds have been implemented in clinics against microbial diseases. Unfortunately, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has significantly reduced the efficacy of existing standard antimicrobials. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared antimicrobial resistance as one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to discover new antimicrobial agents against drug-resistant pathogens. In the present article, we have discussed the importance of plant metabolites in the context of their medicinal applications and elaborated on their mechanism of antimicrobial action against human pathogens. The WHO has categorized some drug-resistant bacteria and fungi as critical and high priority based on the need to develope new drugs, and we have considered the plant metabolites that target these bacteria and fungi.

"Metabolic analysis of four phenolic acids in rat by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry","18603488.0","A liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-ESI-MS(n)) method was established for the analysis of danshensu, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and isoferulic acid in rat plasma, bile, urine and feces after oral administration or intravenous injection. Liquid-liquid extraction was employed for the preparation of biosamples, and the chromatographic separation was carried out using an Agilent Zorbax Extend C(18) reversed phase column and acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid as the mobile phase. Totally nineteen metabolites were detected and identified as prototype, methylated, hydroxylated, sulfated and glucuronized conjugates. The metabolism of the individual phenolic acids in biosamples was investigated, and the metabolic pathway was proposed. By comparing the metabolism of different compounds which shared similar structures, we were able to find that methylation was the main pathway of danshensu metabolism, and the double bond on the side chain was critical for the drug excretion via bile and the formation of glucuronized conjugates. The results proved that the established method was simple, sensitive and reliable, which could be used to detect and identify the structures of metabolites and to better understand their in vivo metabolism.","1292.0"
"Identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in rat urine by HPLC-MS(n)","18850580.0","This is a report about the identification of key metabolites of tectorigenin in rat urine using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometric method (HPLC-ESI-MS(n)). Six healthy rats were administered a single dose (80 mg/kg) of tectorigenin by oral gavage. Urine was sampled for 0-24 h and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the supernatants, then the supernatants were purified by solid-phase extraction with a C(18) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was carried out on a reversed-phase C(18) column with a gradient elution program whereas acetonitrile-0.1% formic acid water was used as mobile phase. Mass spectra were acquired in negative ionization mode and a data-dependant scan was used for the identification of the key metabolites of tectorigenin in the urine samples. As a result, four phase II metabolites and the parent drug tectorigenin were found and identified in rat urine for the first time.","1293.0"
"Changes of some chemical substances and antioxidant capacity of mandarin orange segments during can processing","","Changes of ascorbic acid (AA), flavanone glycosides (FGs), phenolic acids and antioxidant capacity which was expressed as equivalent (AEAC) total (TAC) determined by ferric reducing power (FRAP) assay radical scavenging (RSC) 2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, mandarin orange segments during can processing were investigated. The effects four key procedures studied, namely blanching, HCl, alkaline canning treatment. As a result, after canning, the FGs content decreased from 502.39 mg/kg to 254.27 mg/kg, 57.51 44.20 mg/kg. similar decreasing tendency also true AA (from 251.87 186.98 mg/kg), TAC 664.48 391.95 inhibition DPPH 34.85% 27.31%). To be concluded, small proportions lost, loss about fifty percent. However, in view considerable part compounds existing syrup portion; not large that. Therefore, we suggested that majority AA, (FGs acids) retained processing, cans could serve substitute when fresh fruits are available.","1294.0"
"Phenolic antioxidants richly contained in corn bran are slightly bioavailable in rats","15941352.0","Phenolic acids (PAs) have been shown to be beneficial to human health and are found most abundantly in corn bran ( approximately 4%, w/w), one of the main dietary fibers. This study therefore evaluated the bioavailabilities of phenolic antioxidants ferulic acid (FA) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) in refined corn bran (RCB) by determining their recovery in the plasma, urine, and feces of rats fed a single meal of a RCB diet containing 5% RCB or adapted to the RCB diet for 10 days. In both studies, 0.4-0.5% of ingested FA and 1.2-2.3% of ingested PCA were recovered in rat urine. By contrast, approximately 81% of FA and approximately 64% of PCA ingested with the single meal were excreted through the rat feces within 3 days after the ingestion. On the other hand, after rats were fed the RCB diet, total FA (all forms of FA) was recovered in plasma at a concentration of 35.0 +/- 2.0 microg/L, total FA and total PCA were excreted through urine at levels of 155.4 +/- 5.8 and 50.9 +/- 6.6 microg/day, respectively. These parameters showed no significant change (P = 0.93, 0.09, and 0.66, respectively) after rats were fed the RCB diet continuously for up to 10 days. These results suggest that the PAs in RCB are bioavailable in rats. Their bioavailabilities, however, are relatively low compared with their high content in RCB and not improved by the adaptation for 10 days to the enriched RCB diet. Additionally, comparison with the results of other studies revealed that high contents of FA and, especially, diferulic acids in cereal bran, which act as cross-links between bran cell wall polysaccharides, may not improve but, rather, limit the bioavailabilities of PAs in vivo.","1295.0"
"Sesamin is one of the major precursors of mammalian lignans in sesame seed (Sesamum indicum) as observed in vitro and in rats","16549449.0","Plant lignans occur in many foods, with flaxseed presently recognized as the richest source. Some plant lignans can be converted by intestinal microbiota to the mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, which may have protective effects against hormone-related diseases such as breast cancer. This study determined whether plant lignans in sesame seed, particularly sesamin, could be metabolized to the mammalian lignans. The total plant lignan concentration in sesame seed (2180 micromol/100 g) was higher than that in flaxseed (820 micromol/100 g). In vitro fermentation with human fecal inoculum showed conversion of sesamin to the mammalian lignans, although at a lower rate (1.1%) compared with that of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (57.2%). However, when fed to female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 d, sesamin (15 mg/kg body weight) and a 10% sesame seed diet resulted in greater (P < 0.05) urinary mammalian lignan excretion (3.2 and 11.2 micromol/d, respectively), than the control (< 0.05 micromol/d). We conclude that sesame seed is a rich source of mammalian lignan precursors and sesamin is one of them. From intermediate metabolites of sesamin identified in rat urine by GC-MS, a tentative metabolic pathway of sesamin to mammalian lignans is suggested.","1296.0"
"Antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds in selected herbs","","The antioxidant capacities (oxygen radical absorbance capacity, ORAC) and total phenolic contents in extracts of 27 culinary herbs and 12 medicinal herbs were determined. The ORAC values and total phenolic contents for the medicinal herbs ranged from 1.88 to 22.30 micromol of Trolox equivalents (TE)/g of fresh weight and 0.23 to 2.85 mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g of fresh weight, respectively. Origanum x majoricum, O. vulgare ssp. hirtum, and Poliomintha longiflora have higher ORAC and phenolic contents as compared to other culinary herbs. The ORAC values and total phenolic content for the culinary herbs ranged from 2.35 to 92.18 micromol of TE/g of fresh weight and 0.26 to 17.51 mg of GAE/g of fresh weight, respectively. These also were much higher than values found in the medicinal herbs. The medicinal herbs with the highest ORAC values were Catharanthus roseus, Thymus vulgaris, Hypericum perforatum, and Artemisia annua. A linear relationship existed between ORAC values and total phenolic contents of the medicinal herbs (R = 0.919) and culinary herbs (R = 0.986). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diode-array detection was used to identify and quantify the phenolic compounds in selected herbs. Among the identified phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid was the predominant phenolic compound in Salvia officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, Origanum x majoricum, and P. longiflora, whereas quercetin-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 6)-glucoside and kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 6)-glucoside were predominant phenolic compounds in Ginkgo biloba leaves.","1297.0"
"Oxygen radical absorbing capacity of phenolics in blueberries, cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries","12517117.0","The antioxidant activity of phenolics in fruits of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum cv. Sierra), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Ben Lear), wild chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa), and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea cv. Amberland) was determined in this study. The phenolic constituents and contents among the different berries varied considerably. Anthocyanins were found to be the main components in all these berries. Chlorogenic acid in blueberry, quercetin glycosides in cranberry and lingonberry, and caffeic acid and its derivative in chokeberry were also present in relatively high concentrations. Chlorogenic acid, peonidin 3-galactoside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and cyanidin 3-galactoside were the most important antioxidants in blueberry, cranberry, wild chokeberry, and lingonberry, respectively. The contribution of individual phenolics to the total antioxidant capacity was generally dependent on their structure and content in the berries. Phenolics such as quercetin and cyanidin, with 3',4'-dihydroxy substituents in the B ring and conjugation between the A and B rings, had highly effective radical scavenging structures in blueberries, cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries. Phenolic acids such as caffeic acid also showed high antioxidant activity, probably due to its dihydroxylation in the 3,4 positions as hydrogen donors.","1298.0"
"Endogenous biophenol, fatty acid and volatile profiles of selected oils","","Fatty acid composition, total phenols, phenolic and volatile profile data are presented for cold-pressed and refined camellia oil, in comparison to other commercially available oils -- avocado, pumpkin, sesame and soybean -- representing a cross-section of bulk, “bland” oils (e.g., soybean) through to more boutique oils consumed primarily for taste (e.g., pumpkin). Camellia oil has a high oleic acid content, low polyunsaturated acid content, and levels of endogenous phenols comparable, in quantity and diversity, to cold-pressed oils. Volatile profiles of camellia oil are also comparable to cold-pressed oils, in that alkanals are the dominant headspace compounds, as measured by solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography. These factors suggest that camellia oil may find much wider commercial acceptance outside its current market range, southern China.","1299.0"
"Direct analysis of trans-resveratrol in red wine by high performance liquid chromatography with chemiluminescent detection","","A novel high-performance liquid chromatography with chemiluminescence detection has been developed for the determination of trans-resveratrol in red wines based on the enhancement by trans-resveratrol of the chemiluminescence from luminol-potassium ferricyanide system in alkaline medium. Samples were separated on a C8 column using isocratic elution of methanol/water (35:65). Quantification of trans-resveratrol in Chinese red wines was performed without any sample pretreatment. It allows for the determination of trans-resveratrol in the range 0.5-750 microgram/L with a detection limit of 0.166 microgram/L (S/N = 3). The relative standard deviation (RSD) is 1.16% for 7.5 microgram/L trans-resveratrol (n = 11). trans-Resveratrol was detected in Chinese red wines with the recoveries of 92.2-114.7%. Concentrations ranged from 0 to 1.607 mg/L in Chinese red wines.","1300.0"
"Reduced-oxidized glutathione status as a potential index of oxidative stress in mature cereal grain","","The purpose of this study was to examine the reduced and oxidized glutathione status of selected cereal grains as a potential index of balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant systems, and the contribution of reduced glutathione to the total antioxidant status in cereal grain extracts. Wheat cultivars Almari and Henika, barley cultivars Gregor and Mobek, rye cultivar Dankowskie Zlote, oat cultivar Slawko, and buckwheat cultivar Kora were used. Total antioxidant status (TAS) was measured by the ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulphonate)) method. Contents of total phenolic compounds were also determined. Reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (gamma-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine) were assayed using the spectrofluorimetric method, and results were confirmed by the enzyme recycling method. Correlation coefficient for the GSH/GSSC ratio was r = 0.79. Correlation between TAS and the total phenolic compound content was r = 0.81. Correlation between GSH/GSSG ratio and TAS values was r = 0.46, depending on the extraction system used. The GSH/GSSG ratio may indicate a hierarchy among different cultivars and variance of cereal grains against damage caused by reactive oxygen species. For the main water-soluble antioxidants, our data indicate a potential hierarchy of resistance in investigated cereals against oxidative stress (buckwheat > wheat > barley approximately equal to rye > oat). This hierarchy was confirmed by the ability of investigated cereal extracts to scavenge superoxide anion radicals in vitro. The reduced-oxidized glutathione status in different cereal grains can be applied as a potential index of balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant systems.","1301.0"
"Antioxidant activity and total phenolics in selected cereal grains and their different morphological fractions","10888490.0","The purpose of this study was to examine the antioxidant properties of water and 80% methanolic extracts of cereal grains and their different morphological fractions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Almari and cv. Henika, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cv. Gregor and cv. Mobek, rye (Secale cereale L.) cv. Dańkowskie Zlote, oat (Avena sativa L.) cv. Slawko and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) cv. Kora were used. PC (L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine) liposome system and spectrophotometric assay of total antioxidant activity (TAA) were used to evaluate the antioxidative activity of extracts. Among the water extracts, only the one prepared from buckwheat exhibited antioxidant activity at the concentration analyzed. The following hierarchy of antioxidant activity was provided for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grain: buckwheat > barley > oat > wheat congruent with rye. The antioxidant activity was observed in extract prepared from separated parts of buckwheat and barley. In respect to hulls, the antioxidant hierarchy was as follows: buckwheat > oat > barley. The correlation coefficient between total phenolic compounds and total antioxidative activity of the extracts was -0.35 for water extracts and 0.96, 0.99, 0.80, and 0.99 for 80% methanolic extracts originated from whole grains, hulls, pericarb with testa fractions and endosperm with embryo fractions, respectively.","1302.0"

"Antioxidants in thermally treated buckwheat groats","16917808.0","The seeds of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench L.) were dehulled and then, following milling, extruded on a counter rotating, twin-screw extruder with the different barrel temperature profiles: 120, 160, and 200 degrees C. After extrusion cooking process, the following compounds were analyzed: free and conjugated phenolic acids, total polyphenols (TPC), tocopherols (T) and tocotrienols (T3), inositol phosphates (IP), reduced glutathione (GSH), and melatonin (MLT). The antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase-like activity (SOD-like activity) were determined in the groats and extrudates. Extrusion caused a significant decrease in all the compounds tested, except for phenolic acids. The content of IP decreased by 13%, that of GSH by 42%, and that of T + T3 by 62%. A three-fold lower level of MLT and TPC was noted whereas the SOD-like activity disappeared when compared to the nonextruded material. A two-fold higher content of phenolic acids (free and released from ester bonds) was observed. In spite of the clear decrease in the investigated antioxidants, the extruded dehulled buckwheat seeds contained still significant content of bioactive compounds, which resulted in as little as an average 10% decrease of the antioxidant capacity.","1304.0"
"Effects of growing site and nitrogen fertilization on biomass production and lignan content of linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.)","","There is strong evidence that the lignan precursors from vegetable material, secoisolariciresinol (seco) and matairesinol (mata), are major sources to support the development of lignans in the mammalian colon. Recent studies have shown these active agents to have anticancer properties, especially for mammary or prostatic carcinomas. Linseed is currently by far the best-known source of seco and mata. To support the development of a food supplement, cultivars of linseed were tested at two sites and under increasing nitrogen supply to investigate how the lignan content is affected. The results indicated that the nitrogen supply did not affect the content of seco and mata at either site. A significant difference in seed yield could be measured between the sites, but the overall lignan content - even though significant - was less affected. The main effects were relatively similar at both sites and derived from the cultivars, indicating that the lignan content is very much dependent on genetic predisposition.","1305.0"
"Separation, characterization and quantitation of benzoic and phenolic antioxidants in American cranberry fruit by GC-MS","12059161.0","A GC-MS method is reported for separation and characterization of widely different amounts of benzoic and phenolic acids as their trimethylsilyl derivatives simultaneously in cranberry. Fifteen benzoic and phenolic acids (benzoic, o-hydroxybenzoic, cinnamic, m-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxyphenyl acetic, phthalic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic, vanillic, o-hydroxycinnamic, 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic, p-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, and sinapic acid) were identified in cranberry fruit in their free and bound forms on the basis of GC retention times and simultaneously recorded mass spectra. Except for benzoic, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, 10 other phenolic acids identified have not been reported in cranberry before. The quantitation of the identified components was based on total ion current (TIC). The experimental results indicated cranberry fruit contains a high content of benzoic and phenolic acids (5.7 g/kg fresh weight) with benzoic acid being the most abundant (4.7 g/kg fresh weight). The next most abundant are p-coumaric (0.25 g/kg fresh weight) and sinapic (0.21 g/kg fresh weight) acid. Benzoic and phenolic acids occur mainly in bound forms and only about 10% occurs as free acid.","1306.0"
"Variation in ferulic acid concentration among diverse barley cultivars measured by HPLC and microspectrophotometry","","Ferulic acid (FA) is a low molecular weight phenolic acid that is a common component of the outer layers of cereal grains. It has been implicated in resistance to both insect and fungal pathogens. The FA concentrations of 18 cultivars of 2-row and 6-row barleys, grown in 2 locations, were quantified by HPLC analysis following acid hydrolysis. The FA concentrations ranged from 365 to 605 micrograms/g dry weight. The concentration of FA varied significantly among the different cultivars of barley. A genetic basis for FA levels is inferred by the similar ranking of the cultivars in both locations. FA levels were also measured by the absorbance at 340 nm of the acid-hydrolyzed extract, and in situ detection of fluorescence intensity of the ground grain using a UMSP80 microspectrofluorimeter. Both of these methods are more rapid than HPLC and may allow the practical screening of FA concentrations in numerous barley lines.","1307.0"
"243 962","","Laboratory confirmation of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) relies on detection of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> in a biological specimen. Clinical management guidelines for patients presenting with signs and/or symptoms of meningitis and encephalitis emphasize the need for appropriate specimen collection for laboratory testing. To explore the potential for IMD under-diagnosis, we reviewed medical records of patients admitted with signs and/or symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis at five hospitals in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2014 to 2023. Among 675 patients admitted with meningitis and/or encephalitis with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures who received antibiotics, 300 (44.4%) received antibiotics before CSF collection. Among 431 with blood cultures who received antibiotics, 133 (30.9%) received antibiotics before blood collection. Among 751 patients with CSF collected, 651 (86.7%) CSF specimens were tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for <i>N. meningitidis</i> detection. No blood specimens were PCR-tested. These findings indicated that current standard-of-care practices may lead to IMD under-diagnosis. Since public health surveillance relies on IMD laboratory diagnosis, these findings highlight the potential for under-ascertained IMD by surveillance.",""
